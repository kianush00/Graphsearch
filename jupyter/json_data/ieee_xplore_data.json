We present the role of REST API in the IoT Systems and some initial concepts of IoT, whose technology is able to record and count everything. We as well highlight the concept of middleware that connects these devices and cloud. The appearance of new IoT applications in the cloud has brought new threats to security and privacy of data. Therefore it is required to introduce a secure IoT system which doesn't allow attackers infiltration in the network through IoT devices and also to secure data in transit from IoT devices to cloud. We provide the details on how Representational State Transfer (REST) API allows to securely expose connected devices to applications on cloud and users. In the proposed model, middleware is primarily used to expose device data through REST and to hide details and act as an interface to the user to interact with sensor data.",

CS aims to reduce the number of samples acquired and transmitted by a sensor node using a low complex sampling operation. Furthermore, distributed compressive sensing (DCS) was introduced where the compressively sampled sensors' readings are jointly recovered at the fusion center rather than being recovered separately as in the CS. As a result, a reduction in the number of required measurements as well as the complexity of the sensor nodes is achieved. None of the previous works had studied the performance of DCS for sensed signals with abnormalities caused by sensor malfunctioning, sudden changes in temperature, or humidity. (i.e., practical IoT networks). In this paper, we extensively study the performance of DCS when signals with abnormalities are considered using simulations. The results show that DCS outperforms CS in successfully recovering signals with abnormalities.",

Traditional security systems are more power consuming as it has to record for 24x7 with more throughput but less efficient. Thus need human in middle to upload into cloud is needed. In this work, we propose a low-cost energy efficient smart security system for CCTV with other network nodes. Whenever motion is detected by passive infrared (PIR) sensor, at that time only the camera and all other security sensor nodes in network are activated (Switched on), the captured video and information (sensor data) are stamped on the image using image processing techniques on Python platform. It will be stored in a local storage device, after certain threshold (based on sensitivity of the location) data will be uploaded into the cloud along with data log created during processing stage by Python programming model. In this way, we can reduce the amount of data to be stored (as no recording when idle), consumed power (as device is switched off when idle), maintenance cost(as fully programmed). No need for human in middle for uploading data into the cloud (as program will upload data in to cloud). Because of time, date and information (data from sensor nodes) stamping on each frame of video using python programming model video access becomes easier, as data log will be created.",

It would provide great quality of service (QoS) due to low latency, less implementation cost and high efficiency in data processing. These networks could be either a point-to-point (P2P) communication link or a point-to-multipoint (P2M) communication link, which, P2M is also known as multi-casting that addresses multiple subscribers. The P2M systems usually have diverse nodes (also called as `Things') according to services and levels of security required. These nodes need an uninterrupted network inter-connectivity as well as a cloud platform to manage data sharing and storage. However, the Internet of Things (IoT), with real-time applications like in smart cities, wearable gadgets, medical, military, connected driver-less cars, etc., includes massive data processing and transmission. Nevertheless, integrated circuits (ICs) deployed in IoT based infrastructures have strong constraints in terms of size, cost, power consumption and security. Concerning the last aspect, the main challenges identified so far are resilience of the deployed infrastructure, confidentiality, integrity of exchanged data, user privacy and authenticity. Therefore, well secured and effective cryptographic algorithms are needed that cause small hardware footprints, i.e. Lightweight Cryptography (LWC), also with the provision of robustness, long range transfer of encrypted data and acceptable level of security.In this paper, the implementation, challenges and futuristic applications of LWC algorithms for smart IoT devices have been discussed, especially the performance of Long-Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) which is an open standard that defines the communication protocol for Low-Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) technology.",

Studies on such solutions generally reference the specific communication medium while negating the complete architecture of the IoT system. From a system perspective, a complete IoT solution can be separated into three categories, the data collector, the communication method and the cloud platform service. The data collector relates to the embedded system device (or the `things' element) at the source of the application, the communication method relates to the network protocol used to send or receive the data and the cloud platform service relates to the facility used to store and process the data collected. LoRaWan and LoRa are `Long Range' technologies, which define the communication method for such IoT applied systems. LoRa defines the modulation technique, that allows for long range communication, whereas LoRaWan defines the communication and system architecture.This paper presents the design architecture and methodology of a fully functioning LoRaWan based IoT system.

However, existing approaches are largely designed for specific architectures, and hence are not broadly applicable across different IoT devices. Emerging platforms based on portable, hardware-independent software should rely on lightweight operating systems (OSs) designed specifically for embedded IoT applications, such as Arm mbed OS and Contiki OS. To enable the widespread use of transient computing, transient approaches need to be integrated into these operating systems. In this paper, we discuss the challenges of providing software primitives for transient computing to facilitate hardware-independent implementation using standard OS APIs, and present the integration of a state-of-art transient approach, Hibernus into mbed OS. This OS is chosen due to the large community of developers and the open-source IoT code availability. Transient computing is offered through a modular and layered structure that uses the available mbed OS APIs, including different strategies for retaining the system state designed for different types of flash memory. To illustrate the applicability of the proposed design, we implemented Hibernus on two mbed platforms with different flash memories, which respectively requires 4.7mF and 4.9mF of additional storage.",

Meanwhile, monitoring should minimize the resulting energy and traffic overhead; to leave the network unconstrained during its normal operation. To tackle this problem, several integrated optimization models and efficient algorithms were proposed during the course of PhD. Our activities and results cover the monitor placement and scheduling problems. The topology is represented by a graph, and several graph related optimization problems can be solved. We aim at realizing a polynomial-time solvable monitor placement algorithm. Furthermore, to minimize the monitoring overhead and maximize longevity, monitoring roles should be balanced and alternated amongst nodes; therefore, we target optimal monitor scheduling.

The real potential of the IoT lies in facilitating largescale sharing of high-quality context-rich information through systems-of-IoT-systems, rather than IoT systems that operate as isolated technology silos. Real large-scale interoperability requires layers of standards, and each layer addresses different interoperability challenges. The SensorThings API data model seeks to tackle data interoperability at the data and informational layers of IoT platforms. SensorThings API is aligned to the ISO/OGC O&M data standard, and like O&M it is semi-structured. Semi-structured models allow for variance within implementations for different use-cases, which is both necessary and detrimental to systems interoperability.In this paper we propose that the SensorThings API data model should be defined as a set of archetypes, used to capture extensible domain concepts using a two-level modeling IoT systems design approach. Extending two-level modeling to the IoT using the SensorThings API as a base for domain concepts definition allows for a powerful framework to manage variance within systems implementation and maintaining semantic interoperability within systems-of-IoT-systems across diverse use-cases.",

Reasonably obvious privacy risks result from IoT-connected devices when they emit identifiable information, for this can reveal the activities of device users. More subtle risks arise when bulk device data is available for analysis, and linkage to auxiliary data sets, because identification or re-identification of users can follow. At the same time, security engineers are now designing for the \u201cIdentity of Things\u201d, exploiting embedded cryptography and SIM-like modules to help with the authentication and authorization of devices acting as independent agents in the IoT. To help protect privacy while allowing precise authentication, this paper sets out a new model for digital identity management, comprising a stack of identities, attributes, and attribute metadata. As with the familiar OSI network stack, the digital identity stack helps to decouple different layers of authentication technology, so that IoT data is shared on an explicit need-to-know basis, and extraneous disclosures are minimized.",

The Internet of Things (IoT) has the ability to radically alter the telecom business, according to this research. on network architecture, service delivery, and business models. To begin, IoT enables the development of smarter, more robust network infrastructure by deploying linked devices and sensors. These devices offer real-time monitoring, predictive maintenance, and proactive management of network infrastructure, resulting in increased dependability, lower downtime, and better resource usage. Second, IoT-driven data analytics and insights enable telecommunications firms to provide customized services and experiences to their consumers. Telecom companies may increase their service offerings and income streams by using massive volumes of data created by connected devices. Examples include smart home automation, linked automobiles, and industrial IoT applications. Furthermore, IoT accelerates the transition to 5G networks by opening up new use cases and applications that need ultra-low latency, high dependability, and huge connection. From self-driving cars to remote healthcare monitoring, IoT expands the capabilities of 5G networks, opening up new opportunities for companies and consumers alike. Despite its enormous promise, IoT in the telecommunications business poses security, privacy, interoperability, and scalability concerns. Addressing these concerns needs strong cybersecurity measures, industry standards, and stakeholder engagement to maintain the integrity, confidentiality, and resilience of IoT-enabled networks and services.

IoT involves the growing collection of objects known as things with unique identifiers. These objects have the ability to automatically transfer data over a network. Most of the increase in IoT communication comes from computing devices and embedded sensor systems which are used in industrial machine-to-machine (M2M) communication, home and building automation, vehicle to vehicle communication, smart energy grids, and wearable devices. Because the idea is to connect all physical objects to Internet, security has not always been measured in product design. The IoT products fail to select sufficiently strong security. Therefore, security is one of the important factors in IoT that should be taken care on priority basis. This study proposes IoT architecture which deals with security of devices. The main aim of this study is to make sure that an authentic device uploads the data and restrict false data being uploaded by devices trying to be an authentic device. The study presents a strong authentication technique based on secret keys which protects the identity of IoT devices in the network.

To combat this shortage, IoT devices need to be able to identify vacant radio spectrum that can be used in an opportunistic manner through Cognitive Radio (CR). This paper presents a methodology to determine utilization of FM radio spectrum, which would support efficient IoT device communication via CR. The methodology is showcased by analyzing the FM radio spectrum in an urban area and determining its capacity to support IoT device communication. The results show that the spectrum in the urban area is 76% underutilized.

The identification of these hazards has significant importance for intrusion detection systems (IDS), with the use of machine learning (ML) having been a prevailing practice due to the continuous advancement of cyberattacks. In order to effectively combat such dangers, it is essential that machine learning technologies has the capability to observe a diverse range of attack patterns, hence illustrating the intricacies involved in targeting network traffic. Regrettably, a significant portion of the datasets accessible to the machine learning community lack comprehensive representation of well recognized attack patterns. This is particularly true for datasets pertaining to Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, such as ACK and PUSH-ACK floods. The objective of this project is to address the existing disparity by curating a compilation of assault approaches that are underutilized.

However, for one thing, these methods usually merely consider device traffic or device attributed features, ignoring the complex relationship between devices in Social IoT. For another thing, these features fed to the classifier are often selected manually without automatic learning. These two factors seriously affect the performance and flexibility of the algorithm.

While several demonstrations exist in the literature describing the exploitation procedures of a number of IoT devices, the up-to-date inference, characterization, and analysis of unsolicited IoT devices that are currently deployed \"in the wild\" is still in its infancy. In this article, we address this imperative task by leveraging active and passive measurements to report on unsolicited Internet-scale IoT devices. This work describes a first step toward exploring the utilization of passive measurements in combination with the results of active measurements to shed light on the Internet-scale insecurities of the IoT paradigm. By correlating results of Internet-wide scanning with Internet background radiation traffic, we disclose close to 14,000 compromised IoT devices in diverse sectors, including critical infrastructure and smart home appliances.

Intrusion detection systems (IDS) can be used to monitor IIoT for malicious activities and develop response strategies.

In particular, the GTRGAT model uses GTCN to quickly pull out sequence features from IIoT traffic. GTCN combines convolutional operations and gating mechanisms, aiming to process time series data more efficiently and capture its intrinsic patterns. By using the TON_IoT dataset, the performance of the GTRGAT model is verified, showing that it can accurately detect intrusions.

IOT is an interconnection of a large number of smart objects with low resources. WSN (wireless sensor network) which comprises of a large network of sensors and actuators with constrained capabilities also need resource efficient protocol to be implemented. Security, trustworthiness and privacy are major challenges to turn IOT into a reality. Absence of strong security protocols, attacks with malicious intent and malfunctions will outweigh the benefit of IOT components. Data integrity, identity management, trust management and privacy are four crucial obstacles in designing a secure IOT. To alleviate these challenges and obstacles, a security protocol that uses minimal processor capacity and facilitates targeted security benefits of IOT is proposed. This protocol counters most of security issues with existing IOT protocols and is robust against severe attacks. This protocol is unique in a way that it gives different bit-streams in a given authenticated session for same data which cannot be predicted by the transmitter itself and changes within nanoseconds. Also, a perfectly random signal to choose the bit-stream, in place of pseudo-random code algorithm is used.

It is used in all applications where searching for information is required through the internet. Selection and ranking of relevant web documents to satisfy users\u2019 information need in response to users\u2019 queries is the most important task associated with IR. To better comprehend the user\u2019s intent and create a more efficient query, the initial query has been reformulated by adding new terms. The semantic text-similarity techniques proposed by researchers in the past demand a significant amount of trained labeled data as well as user intervention; both of them are scarce, hard to capture, and difficult to maintain. In general, these techniques ignored contextual information as well as word order, which causes the problems like data sparsity and latitudinal explosion. Deep learning techniques are now being utilized to find text similarities. Various sentence embedding models exist today that can use vectors to represent complete sentences and their semantics. This helps the search engine to comprehend the context, intent, and different aspects of the user text. So, in this paper, a sentence embedding model based query reformulation (QR) has been proposed for improving document ranking performance using a universal sentence encoder (USE) and a cosine similarity measure. Four standard datasets CACM, CISI, ADI, and Medline are used to perform all the experiments.

One such approach is to augment the query where the automatic query expansion increases the precision in information retrieval even if it can cut down the results for some queries. Here, the above approach was tested with the present Urdu data collection obtained via different expansion models such as KL, Bo1 and Bo2. The current collection is quite large in size compared to other existing Urdu datasets. It comprises of 85,304 documents in a TRECschemes and 52 topics with their relevance assessment.

To solve the issue, we combine the methods of query reformulation and re-ranking to improve the performance of QE in Chinese EMR retrieval. First, the synonyms and hyponyms are extracted from a Chinese medical knowledge graph as expansion terms, and the weights of expansion terms are calculated with the combination of semantic similarities, category weights, and co-occurrence frequencies. Then the query is reformulated by these expansion terms, and the EMR documents are retrieved by the expanded query. Second, four categories of medical terms in top retrieval results are selected, and the performances of all combinations in re-ranking are tested to select the most proper terms for re-ranking. Then the original retrieval results are re-ranked by these terms.

However, designing a query that can accurately retrieve the relevant software artifacts can be challenging for developers as it requires a certain level of knowledge and experience regarding the code base. This paper demonstrates how the difficulty of designing a proper query can be alleviated through automatic Query Reformulation (QR) - an under-the-hood operation for reformulating a user's query with no additional input from the user. The proposed QR framework works by enriching a user's search query with certain specific additional terms drawn from the highest-ranked artifacts retrieved in response to the initial query. The important point here is that these additional terms injected into a query are those that are deemed to be \u201cclose\u201d to the original query terms in the source code on the basis of positional proximity. This similarity metric is based on the notion that terms that deal with the same concepts in source code are usually proximal to one another in the same files. We demonstrate the superiority of our QR framework in relation to the QR frameworks well-known in the natural language document retrieval by showing significant improvements in bug localization performance for two large software projects using more than 4,000 queries.",

This paper discusses the performance of various such methods that can be implemented to expand user query such that it gives high precision search results. The paper mainly focuses on word embeddings methods like Word2Vec - CBOW or Skip gram and Glove that are trained on real estate related legal datasets over classical methods. Experimental results show that word embeddings give better results with 87% mean average precision (mAP) values on all datasets.",

              "abstract": "The explosive growth of biomedical literature has made it difficult for biomedical scientists to locate precise articles and keep them up to date with the latest knowledge. In biomedical literature retrieval, the heterogeneity of medical terminologies and jargons suffer from query mismatch (QM). The query expansion approaches significantly improve query mismatch by incorporating and re-weighting additional similar terms in the original query. The reliance on medical ontologies to alleviate QM has garnered significant attention in biomedical literature retrieval. However, sole reliance on these ontologies is not sufficient to retrieve relevant results. Considering the foregoing statement, in this article, we design and implement a fusion query expansion framework by integrating the combination of clinical diagnosis information (CDI) and medical ontology (MO); to improve the query mismatch problem. In the proposed system, we have explored the top three MOs (MeSH, UMLS, SNOMEDCT) to select candidate expansion terms. The outcomes of the ontologies are then integrated, with clinical diagnosis information predicted by the unstructured knowledge bases to get the best query combination leading to more focused BLR. The experimental results procured on Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) Clinical Decision Support (CDS) dataset show that this fusion QE framework performed significantly better when CDI and MeSH ontology used jointly to retrieve articles. Furthermore, our results demonstrate the notable ability of the proposed framework to help search engines to improve QM in biomedical literature retrieval. We expect our proposed approach would assist investigators to use this query combination to retrieve relevant articles.",

The relevance measure of documents and understanding user's queries are main issues in design of IR Systems. This involves improvements at query level and result display level. Personalized retrieval widens the notion of information need to comprise implicit user needs, not directly conveyed by the user in terms of explicit information requests. This can be achieved by expanding the user query and processing the results according to the user needs. Individual pages are retrieved by the traditional IR systems even though the information is spread across multiple pages. Instead composed pages are generated which contains all the query words. Ranking of retrieved pages can be improved by providing composed pages for the given query. As Agents can provide autonomous functioning, they can be used in the design of query expansion, searching and ranking of documents. This paper proposes a multi agent-based intelligent retrieval framework for query expansion and composing of pages.",

Using the information about the user stored in a user profile, these techniques retrieve results that are closer to the user preferences. On the other hand, the information is being stored more and more in an semi-structured way, and XML has emerged as a standard for representing and exchanging this type of data. XML search allows a higher retrieval effectiveness, due to its ability to retrieve and to show the user specific parts of the documents instead of the full document. In this paper we propose several personalization techniques in the context of XML retrieval. We try to combine the different approaches where personalization may be applied: query reformulation, re-ranking of results and retrieval model modification.

It conflates words with different meaning under one index term. This occurs frequently in Arabic when using stems and it becomes more frequent when choosing roots to index the collection. Furthermore, search engine whose index is constructed using a particular stemmer makes it a stemmer-dependent engine. In this paper, we show how we can still use stemming to reach the same results without indexing the stemmed text. Original words have been indexed, and a stemmer used to extract word variants and add them to the user query. Apart from making our search operation stemmer-independent, we proof that our approach is as good as light stemming and is significantly better than root stemming.",

We achieved this by augmenting the original dataset to generate simulated user behavioral data and Ground Truth data.

Query Expansion (QE) is one of the well-known alternative for overcoming these problems. It mainly involves finding synonyms or related words for the query terms. There are several approaches in the query expansion field such as statistical and semantic approaches; they focus on expanding the individual query terms rather than the entire query during the expansion process. An other category of approaches deals with the whole query by using a neural approach based on Pseudo Relevance feedback (PRF) documents. In this work, we carried out an ablation study to measure the impact of the classical and semantic (word embedding, order, context) based query expansion on the retrieval performance. The experiments conducted on the Arabic EveTAR dataset reveal that our hybrid proposed approach combining classical (PRF) and transformer (AraBERT) is competitive with the state-of-the-art methods. In fact, the obtained result in terms of the Mean Average Precision (MAP) is up to 0.72.",

Existing web is dominated by Search Engines which are running on keyword based search system which in turn leads to wastage of end user's precious time if he do not know the key terms which are utilized to index preferred correct pages. For example, a user enters the term \u2018Jaguar\u2019. Now current search engines will display results for \u2018Car Jaguar\u2019, \u2018Cat Jaguar\u2019 and \u2018Operating System Jaguar\u2019. That means it is the overhead on the user to go through the contents of the web pages to get the desired information. The same problem is with image search engines. If query is searched for images of \u2018Tourist places in India\u2019, image result set will return number of irrelevant as well relevant images. To solve this problem solution is required where machine will itself separate the result into relevant and irrelevant one and then presenting the relevant ones to the user and Semantic Web is a step towards that. It is web 3.0, an expansion of the current web, web 2.0 , that permits the meaning of information to be specifically described which can be well understood by computer as well as user.

Latest developments in Natural Language Processing have made it possible to incorporate context and complex lexical patterns to document representations. This opens new possibilities for developing advanced retrieval systems. Traditional approaches for indexing documents suggest averaging word and sentence encoding to form fixed-length document embeddings. However, the common bag-of-word approach fails to incorporate the semantic context, which can be critical for understanding document-query relevancy. We address this by leveraging Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) to create semantically rich document embeddings. BERT compensates the limitations of the Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) by incorporating contextual embeddings. In this paper, we propose an ensemble of BERT and TF-IDF for a document retrieval system, where TFIDF and BERT together score the documents against a query, to retrieve a final set of top K documents. We critically compare our model against the standard TF-IDF method and demonstrate a significant performance improvement on MS MARCO data (Microsoft-curated data of Bing queries).",

BERT has produced extremely promising results for various tasks in natural language understanding, but relatively little research on it is devoted to text information retrieval (IR), let alone SDR. We further tackle one of the critical problems facing SDR, viz. a query is often too short to convey a user's information need, via the process of pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF), showing how information cues induced from PRF can be aptly incorporated into BERT for query expansion. In addition, such query reformulation through PRF also works in conjunction with additional augmentation of lexical features and confidence scores into the document embeddings learned from BERT.
