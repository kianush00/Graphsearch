      "      \"abstract\": \"The security issue impacting the Internet-of-Things (IoT) paradigm has recently attracted significant attention from the research community. To this end, several surveys were put forward addressing various IoT-centric topics, including intrusion detection systems, threat modeling, and emerging technologies. In contrast, in this paper, we exclusively focus on the ever-evolving IoT vulnerabilities. In this context, we initially provide a comprehensive classification of state-of-the-art surveys, which address various dimensions of the IoT paradigm. This aims at facilitating IoT research endeavors by amalgamating, comparing, and contrasting dispersed research contributions. Subsequently, we provide a unique taxonomy, which sheds the light on IoT vulnerabilities, their attack vectors, impacts on numerous security objectives, attacks which exploit such vulnerabilities, corresponding remediation methodologies and currently offered operational cyber security capabilities to infer and monitor such weaknesses. This aims at providing the reader with a multidimensional research perspective related to IoT vulnerabilities, including their technical details and consequences, which is postulated to be leveraged for remediation objectives. Additionally, motivated by the lack of empirical (and malicious) data related to the IoT paradigm, this paper also presents a first look on Internet-scale IoT exploitations by drawing upon more than 1.2 GB of macroscopic, passive measurements' data. This aims at practically highlighting the severity of the IoT problem, while providing operational situational awareness capabilities, which undoubtedly would aid in the mitigation task, at large. Insightful findings, inferences and outcomes in addition to open challenges and research problems are also disclosed in this paper, which we hope would pave the way for future research endeavors addressing theoretical and empirical aspects related to the imperative topic of IoT security.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Internet of Things (IoT) is an integration of the Sensor, Embedded, Computing, and Communication technologies. The purpose of the IoT is to provide seamless services to anything, anytime at any place. IoT technologies play a crucial role everywhere, which brings the fourth revolution of disruptive technologies after the internet and Information and Communication Technology (ICT). The Research & Development community has predicted that the impact of IoT will be more than the internet and ICT on society, which improves the well-being of society and industries. Addressing the predominant system-level design aspects like energy efficiency, robustness, scalability, interoperability, and security issues result in the use of a potential IoT system. This paper presents the current state of art of the functional pillars of IoT and its emerging applications to motivate academicians and researches to develop real-time, energy-efficient, scalable, reliable, and secure IoT applications. This paper summarizes the architecture of IoT, with the contemporary status of IoT architectures. Highlights of the IoT system-level issues to develop more advanced real-time IoT applications have been discussed. Millions of devices exchange information using different communication standards, and interoperability between them is a significant issue. This paper provides the current status of the communication standards and application layer protocols used in IoT with the detailed analysis. The computing paradigms like Cloud, Cloudlet, Fog, and Edge computing facilitate IoT with various services like data offloading, resource and device management, etc. In this paper, an exhaustive analysis of Edge Computing in IoT with different edge computing architectures and existing status are deliberated. The widespread adoption of IoT in society has resulted in privacy and security issues. This paper emphasizes on analyzing the security challenges, privacy and security threats, conventional mitigation techniques, and further scope for IoT security. The features like fewer memory footprints, scheduling, real-time task execution, fewer interrupt, and thread switching latency of Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS) enables the development of time critical IoT applications. Also, this review offers the analysis of the RTOS's suitable for IoT with the current status and networking stack. Finally, open research issues in IoT system development are discussed.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"The unprecedented growth of Internet of Things (IoT) is leading to its increased usage in various domains, such as manufacturing, health, and smart cities. A majority of IoT applications are autonomic, i.e., they operate under minimal/no human intervention, and make decisions/actuations based on machine-to-machine communication and data analytics. A key challenge in the development of such applications is the ability to measure their quality while they are working in a diverse and heterogeneous IoT ecosystem. In this article, we propose an agent-based IoT-Quality Watch (IoT-QWatch) framework that provides the ability to measure IoT quality metrics at each stage of the autonomic IoT application life cycle running in the IoT ecosystem. We envision that IoT-QWatch will enable the development of a new generation of quality-aware autonomic IoT applications that are able to be resilient to the heterogeneous and uncertain nature of IoT ecosystems. We present architectural details and implementation of IoT-QWatch, and corresponding models used to measure IoT quality metrics at different stages. We conduct extensive experiments using a real-world IoT test bed from the domain of manufacturing to validate the efficacy of IoT-QWatch. Experimental outcomes provide promising results in realizing IoT-QWatch in real-world deployment, while the framework itself offers significant extensibility to include new models for measuring IoT quality metrics.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"With the advancement of Internet-of-Things (IoT) technology, various domains, such as smart factories and smart cars have used this new technology to provide value-added services. In addition, technologies, such as multiaccess edge computing (MEC) and network slicing provide another opportunity for the IoT to support more advanced and real-time services that could not have been previously supported. However, the simple integration of such technologies into the IoT does not take the full advantage of MEC and network slicing or the reduction of latency and traffic prioritization, respectively. Therefore, there is a strong need for an efficient integration mechanism for IoT platforms to maximize the benefit of using such technologies. In this article, we introduce a novel architectural framework that enables the virtualization of an IoT platform with minimum functions to support specific IoT services and host the instance in an edge node, close to the end user. As the instance provides its service at the edge node, where the MEC node and network slice are located, the traffic for the end user does not need to traverse back to the cloud. This architecture guarantees not only low latency but also efficient management of IoT services at the edge node. To show the feasibility of the proposed architecture, we conducted an experimental evaluation by comparing the transmission time of both IoT services running on the central cloud and those using sliced IoT functions in the edge gateway. The results show that the proposed architecture provides twice as much transmission speed as that from the conventional cloud-based IoT platform.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"This paper proposes a novel energy-conscious access point ( $e$ AP) system with cross-layer design to increase the energy efficiency of IoT devices in IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi networks for reliable IoT services. The proposed  $e$ AP system controls the energy resources of IoT devices to extend the lifetime of the IoT device. For this purpose, we develop a new  $e$ AP system that considers a cross-layer design with a prompt TCP ACK transmit function, a caching-and-retransmit IoT data function, and a multiple IoT data aggregate function to improve the energy efficiency of the IoT device. In addition, the proposed  $e$ AP system has a device energy management module that precisely controls operating parameters, such as the transmission period of IoT packets, the delivery of traffic indication message (DTIM) value of IoT devices, and the transmitting power of IoT devices. These features extend the lifetime of the battery-powered IoT devices while satisfying service requirements for reliable IoT services. The long listening time of TCP ACK messages in receive mode (Rx) results in the high energy consumption of IoT devices due to the large round trip time. The proposed  $e$ AP system reduces the reception time of TCP ACK messages in the IoT device, using the prompt TCP ACK transmit function in the  $e$ AP. This reduces the long Rx mode time for TCP ACK reception, and increases the short sleep mode time, which results in increase of the energy efficiency of the IoT device. In the energy-saving analyses, we formulate an energy consumption model for the IoT device, and determine the energy-saving gain when the IoT device uses the  $e$ AP system model, compared to a legacy AP system model. Our performance evaluation results verify that the proposed  $e$ AP system achieves a maximum improvement in energy efficiency of approximately 88%, and 8.4 times improvement in the expected lifetime of the IoT device, compared to the legacy AP system model.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"With the recent advances of the Internet of Things (IoT), innovative techniques, and concepts have emerged, such as digital twins and industrial 4.0. As one of the essential parts of a digital twin, IoT-based smart predictive maintenance (IoT-SPM) is a key enabling technology for smart manufacturing. This article introduces digital twins and their relationship to IoT-SPM and proposes a reference IoT-SPM, aiming to provide a comprehensive and systematic outlook for the IoT-SPM field. Thus, it can be used as a guide map for interested readers. To give a complete picture of the IoT-SPM ecosystem in industrial 4.0 systems, this article conducts an analysis from multiview perspectives, starting with the architecture, followed by platforms and component. The key components or requirements of an IoT-SPM ecosystem are identified and outlined, including the IoT and cyber\\u2013physical system (CPS) as the cornerstone technologies, IoT monitoring data as the base, big data platforms as the backbone, an upgraded computing paradigm as the catalyst, and machine learning-based data analysis as the main processor. This article also focuses on the issues surrounding IoT data when applying analytic models to a real-world industrial IoT system. Then, the current progresses relating IoT and IoT-SPM are depicted, and a research gap on IoT data quality is identified. In particular, regarding the identified IoT data quality problems, this article qualitatively evaluates and discusses the existing solutions. These discussions lead to several open research issues and future directions.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Information-centric networking (ICN) is being realized as a promising approach to accomplish the shortcomings of current Internet protocol-address-based networking. ICN models are based on naming the content to get rid of address-space scarcity, accessing the content via name-based-routing, and caching the content at intermediate nodes to provide reliable, efficient data delivery, and self-certifying contents to ensure better security. Obvious benefits of ICN in terms of fast and efficient data delivery and improved reliability raises ICN as highly promising networking model for Internet of Things (IoT) like environments. IoT aims to connect anyone and/or anything at any time by any path on any place. From last decade, IoT attracts both industry and research communities. IoT is an emerging research field and still in its infancy. Thus, this paper presents the potential of ICN for IoT by providing state-of-the-art literature survey. We discuss briefly the feasibility of ICN features and their models (and architectures) in the context of IoT. Subsequently, we present a comprehensive survey on ICN-based caching, naming, security, and mobility approaches for IoT with appropriate classification. Furthermore, we present operating systems and simulation tools for ICN-IoT. Finally, we provide important research challenges and issues faced by ICN for IoT.\",\n",

However, security and privacy issues are a great challenge for IoT but they are also enabling factors to create a \\u201ctrust ecosystem.\\u201d In fact, the intrinsic vulnerabilities of IoT devices, with limited resources and heterogeneous technologies, together with the lack of specifically designed IoT standards, represent a fertile ground for the expansion of specific cyber threats. In this paper, we try to bring order on the IoT security panorama providing a taxonomic analysis from the perspective of the three main key layers of the IoT system model: 1) perception; 2) transportation; and 3) application levels. As a result of the analysis, we will highlight the most critical issues with the aim of guiding future research directions.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"With the advancement of the Internet of Things (IoT), different use cases, such as smart factories, smart cities, and smart cars are being developed. Technologies, such as multiaccess edge computing (MEC) and network slicing are being researched to support various vertical use cases. However, simply utilizing network slicing and MEC is insufficient when providing a specific IoT service. Accordingly, there is a need for a method of arranging and operating common service functions (CSFs) used in the IoT platform at the edge of the network. In addition, it is necessary not only to deliver virtual CSFs but also to implement autoscaling policies of these virtual common service resources. This study extends the idea of resource slicing technologies for the IoT service layer. The IoT service layer exposes the virtual IoT CSFs as an IoT slice service to be provided in the form of virtual network functions (VNFs) with MEC applications on top of the network function virtualization infrastructure (NFVI) at the edge of the network. We propose a framework architecture for virtual IoT slice service orchestration, and illustrate how to instantiate the virtual IoT service functions in the existing centralized cloud to the MEC platform. We also propose an elastic computing algorithm of virtual IoT slice services functions(vIoT-SSFs) resources at the NFVI so that the IoT applications and underlying IoT resources can access vIoT-SSFs at the edge of the network.\",\n",

We introduce the Dynamic AI-IoT architecture, a novel framework designed to eliminate the need for cumbersome firmware updates. This architecture leverages Narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) to facilitate smooth cloud interactions and incorporates tailored firmware extensions for enabling dynamic interactions with Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) models. A sophisticated memory management mechanism, grounded in memory alignment and dynamic AI operations resolution, is introduced to efficiently handle AI tasks. Empirical experiments demonstrate the feasibility of implementing a Dynamic AI-IoT system using ULP IoT devices on a 5G testbed. The results show model updates taking less than one second and an average inference time of approximately 46 ms.\",\n",

Internet of Things (IoT) is at the forefront of this transformation imparting capabilities, such as real-time monitoring, situational awareness and intelligence, control, and cyber security to transform the existing EPES into intelligent cyber-enabled EPES, which is more efficient, secure, reliable, resilient, and sustainable. Additionally, digitizing the electric power ecosystem using IoT improves asset visibility, optimal management of distributed generation, eliminates energy wastage, and create savings. IoT has a significant impact on EPESs and offers several opportunities for growth and development. There are several challenges with the deployment of IoT for EPESs. Viable solutions need to be developed to overcome these challenges to ensure continued growth of IoT for EPESs. The advancements in computational intelligence capabilities can evolve an intelligent IoT system by emulating biological nervous systems with cognitive computation, streaming and distributed analytics including at the edge and device levels. This review paper provides an assessment of the role, impact and challenges of IoT in transforming EPESs.\",\n",

Therefore, the design and implementation of IoT gateways is crucial. In this article, with reference to the architecture of a prototypical multi-interface gateway (MIG) (based on commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) devices), we evaluate its performance: 1) analytically, through an innovative Markov chain-based model; 2) by simulation, with a Python simulator; and 3) experimentally, through the (starting) COTS device-based prototype. In detail, the MIG is equipped with heterogeneous wireless communication interfaces (namely, LoRaWAN, BLE, cellular 4G Cat. 4, and IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi 2.4 GHz) and is applicable to multiple IoT scenarios. The obtained simulation and experimental results show the validity of the proposed analytical model. Further improvements of the proposed framework are eventually discussed.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Recently, the Internet of Things (IoT) has attracted the interest of network researchers all over the world. Multimedia transmission through IoT presents an important challenge owing to nodes diversity. In this paper, adaptive versions of the real-time transport protocol (RTP) and real-time control protocol (RTCP), i.e., IoT-RTP and IoT-RTCP, are proposed. In these versions, the nature of IoT environments, such as transmission channels heterogeneity, sudden change in session size, and different multimedia sources, is considered. The basic idea of the proposed adaptive versions is to divide the large multimedia sessions into simple sessions with awareness of network status. To achieve this target, additional fields are added to the RTP and RTCP headers. These fields work under certain conditions to decrease the network overload. Finally, to test the performance of the proposed IoT-RTP and IoT-RTCP, a simulation environment is constructed using the network simulation package (NS2).The results of intensive simulations proved that the proposed adaptive versions of the multimedia protocols outperform the basic ones in terms of end-to-end delay, delay jitter, number of receiver reports, packet loss, throughput, and energy consumption.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Recently, wireless technologies have been growing actively all around the world. In the context of wireless technology, fifth-generation (5G) technology has become a most challenging and interesting topic in wireless research. This article provides an overview of the Internet of Things (IoT) in 5G wireless systems. IoT in the 5G system will be a game changer in the future generation. It will open a door for new wireless architecture and smart services. Recent cellular network LTE (4G) will not be sufficient and efficient to meet the demands of multiple device connectivity and high data rate, more bandwidth, low-latency quality of service (QoS), and low interference. To address these challenges, we consider 5G as the most promising technology. We provide a detailed overview of challenges and vision of various communication industries in 5G IoT systems. The different layers in 5G IoT systems are discussed in detail. This article provides a comprehensive review on emerging and enabling technologies related to the 5G system that enables IoT. We consider the technology drivers for 5G wireless technology, such as 5G new radio (NR), multiple-input-multiple-output antenna with the beamformation technology, mm-wave commutation technology, heterogeneous networks (HetNets), the role of augmented reality (AR) in IoT, which are discussed in detail. We also provide a review on low-power wide-area networks (LPWANs), security challenges, and its control measure in the 5G IoT scenario. This article introduces the role of AR in the 5G IoT scenario. This article also discusses the research gaps and future directions. The focus is also on application areas of IoT in 5G systems. We, therefore, outline some of the important research directions in 5G IoT.\",\n",

This paper introduces a new Lightweight (LWT) hash function termed Lightweight New Mersenne Number Transform (LNMNT) Hash function, suitable for many IoT applications. The proposed LWT hash function is evaluated in terms of randomness, confusion, diffusion, distribution of hash function, and different attacks. The randomness analysis is performed using the NIST test suit. The LNMNT LWT hash function has been benchmarked against other LWT hash functions in terms of execution time, cycles per byte, memory usage, and consumed energy. The analysis showed that the LNMNT LWT hash function has excellent randomness behavior and is highly sensitive to the slight change in the input message too. Moreover, it provides low execution time, memory usage, and power consumption against the other LWT hash functions.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Today, the Internet of Things (IoT) comprises vertically oriented platforms for things. Developers who want to use them need to negotiate access individually and adapt to the platform-specific API and information models. Having to perform these actions for each platform often outweighs the possible gains from adapting applications to multiple platforms. This fragmentation of the IoT and the missing interoperability result in high entry barriers for developers and prevent the emergence of broadly accepted IoT ecosystems. The BIG IoT (Bridging the Interoperability Gap of the IoT) project aims to ignite an IoT ecosystem as part of the European Platforms Initiative. As part of the project, researchers have devised an IoT ecosystem architecture. It employs five interoperability patterns that enable cross-platform interoperability and can help establish successful IoT ecosystems.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"As the Internet of Things (IoT) is evolving rapidly in various verticals, such as smart cities and smart industries, the number of IoT applications is growing exponentially. Standardized conformance testing mechanisms are widely used to test software applications, including IoT applications. However, current conformance testing mechanisms require continuous human intervention and additional software to be embedded into a target device being tested, which is time consuming, costly, and requires additional memory on the target device. Therefore, there is a considerable need to enhance and optimize existing conformance testing so that it is adequate for automatically testing highly distributed constraint IoT applications. In this paper, we propose a novel mechanism for automated and scalable conformance testing for IoT applications by introducing a test triggering mechanism based on a standardized test interface. This triggering mechanism is based on several new logical components in a testing environment that exchange messages between a testing system and a target IoT device. This technique of automatic conformance testing can lessen the cost and human intercession to decrease the number of missteps and accelerate the IoT market by certifying IoT applications.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Gateways are emerging as a key element of bringing legacy and next generation devices to the Internet of Things (IoT). They integrate protocols for networking, help manage storage and edge analytics on the data, and facilitate data flow securely between edge devices and the cloud. Current IoT gateways solve the communication gap between field control/sensor nodes and customer cloud, enabling field data to be harnessed for manufacturing process optimization, remote management, and preventive maintenance. However, these gateways do not support fully-automatic configuration of newly added IoT devices. In this paper, we proposed a self-configurable gateway featuring real time detection and configuration of smart things over the wireless networks. This novel gateway's main features are: dynamic discovery of home IoT device(s), automatic updates of hardware changes, connection management of smart things connected over AllJoyn. We use the `option' field for automatic configuration of IoT devices rather than modify standard format of CoAP protocol. Proposed gateway functionality has been validated over the large-scale IoT testbed.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Internet of things IoT is playing a remarkable role in the advancement of many fields such as healthcare, smart grids, supply chain management, etc. It also eases people's daily lives and enhances their interaction with each other as well as with their surroundings and the environment in a broader scope. IoT performs this role utilizing devices and sensors of different shapes and sizes ranging from small embedded sensors and wearable devices all the way to automated systems. However, IoT networks are growing in size, complexity, and number of connected devices. As a result, many challenges and problems arise such as security, authenticity, reliability, and scalability. Based on that and taking into account the anticipated evolution of the IoT, it is extremely vital not only to maintain but to increase confidence in and reliance on IoT systems by tackling the aforementioned issues. The emergence of blockchain opened the door to solve some challenges related to IoT networks. Blockchain characteristics such as security, transparency, reliability, and traceability make it the perfect candidate to improve IoT systems, solve their problems, and support their future expansion. This paper demonstrates the major challenges facing IoT systems and blockchain's proposed role in solving them. It also evaluates the position of current researches in the field of merging blockchain with IoT networks and the latest implementation stages. Additionally, it discusses the issues related to the IoT-blockchain integration itself. Finally, this research proposes an architectural design to integrate IoT with blockchain in two layers using dew and cloudlet computing. Our aim is to benefit from blockchain features and services to guarantee a decentralized data storage and processing and address security and anonymity challenges and achieve transparency and efficient authentication service.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"The Internet of Things (IoT) has important applications in all aspects of our lives in areas such as business, military, security, and health. It is known that most IoT node designs are energy constrained. Therefore, maintaining an ideal energy consumption rate has become one of the most important challenges in the IoT research field. In this paper, an IoT Energy Management Scheme (EMS) is proposed. In this system, heterogeneous types of energy-constrained nodes are considered. The proposed EMS comprises three strategies. The first strategy minimizes the volume of data that may be transmitted through the IoT environment. The second strategy schedules the work of the critical energy IoT nodes. The third strategy provides a fault tolerance scenario that can be applied to address inevitable energy problems faced by IoT nodes. Finally, to test the proposed EMS, the NS2 network simulator is used to construct an intensive simulation of the IoT environment. The simulation results proved that the proposed EMS outperformed the traditional IoT system with respect to the following performance metrics: energy consumption rate, number of failed nodes due to energy loss, throughput, and network lifetime.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"The Internet of Things (IoT)-centric concepts like augmented reality, high-resolution video streaming, self-driven cars, smart environment, e-health care, etc. have a ubiquitous presence now. These applications require higher data-rates, large bandwidth, increased capacity, low latency and high throughput. In light of these emerging concepts, IoT has revolutionized the world by providing seamless connectivity between heterogeneous networks (HetNets). The eventual aim of IoT is to introduce the plug and play technology providing the end-user, ease of operation, remotely access control and configurability. This paper presents the IoT technology from a bird's eye view covering its statistical/architectural trends, use cases, challenges and future prospects. The paper also presents a detailed and extensive overview of the emerging 5G-IoT scenario. Fifth Generation (5G) cellular networks provide key enabling technologies for ubiquitous deployment of the IoT technology. These include carrier aggregation, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), massive-MIMO (M-MIMO), coordinated multipoint processing (CoMP), device-to-device (D2D) communications, centralized radio access network (CRAN), software-defined wireless sensor networking (SD-WSN), network function virtualization (NFV) and cognitive radios (CRs). This paper presents an exhaustive review for these key enabling technologies and also discusses the new emerging use cases of 5G-IoT driven by the advances in artificial intelligence, machine and deep learning, ongoing 5G initiatives, quality of service (QoS) requirements in 5G and its standardization issues. Finally, the paper discusses challenges in the implementation of 5G-IoT due to high data-rates requiring both cloud-based platforms and IoT devices based edge computing.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Internet of Things (IoT) services have grown substantially in recent years. Consequently, IoT service providers (SPs) are emerging in the market and competing to offer their services. Many IoT applications utilize these services in an integrated manner with different Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements. Thus, the provisioning of end-to-end QoS is getting more indispensable for IoT platforms. However, provisioning the system by using only QoS metrics without considering user experiences is not sufficient. Recently, Quality of Experience (QoE) model has become a promising approach to quantify actual user experiences of services. A holistic design approach that considers constraints of various QoS/QoE metrics together is needed to satisfy requirements of these applications and services. Besides, IoT services may operate in environments with limited resources. Therefore, effective management of services and system resources is essential for QoS/QoE support. This paper provides a comprehensive survey for the state-of-the-art studies on IoT services with QoS/QoE perspective. Our contributions are threefold: 1) QoE-driven architecture is demonstrated by classifying vital components according to QoE-related functions in prior studies; 2) QoE metrics and QoE optimization objectives are classified by corresponding system and resource control problems in the architecture; and 3) QoE-aware resource management e.g., QoE-aware offloading, placement and data caching policies with recent Machine Learning approaches are extensively reviewed.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Internet of Things (IoT) is characterized as one of the leading actors for the next evolutionary stage in the computing world. IoT-based applications have already produced a plethora of novel services and are improving the living standard by enabling innovative and smart solutions. However, along with its rapid adoption, IoT technology also creates complex challenges regarding the management of IoT networks due to its resource limitations (computational power, energy, and security). Hence, it is urgently needed to refine the IoT-based application\\u2019s architectures to robustly manage the overall IoT infrastructure. Software-defined networking (SDN) has emerged as a paradigm that offers software-based controllers to manage hardware infrastructure and traffic flow on a network effectively. SDN architecture has the potential to provide efficient and reliable IoT network management. This research provides a comprehensive survey investigating the published studies on SDN-based frameworks to address IoT management issues in the dimensions of fault tolerance, energy management, scalability, load balancing, and security service provisioning within the IoT networks. We conducted a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) on the research studies (published from 2010 to 2022) focusing on SDN-based IoT management frameworks. We provide an extensive discussion on various aspects of SDN-based IoT solutions and architectures. We elaborate a taxonomy of the existing SDN-based IoT frameworks and solutions by classifying them into categories such as network function virtualization, middleware, OpenFlow adaptation, and blockchain-based management. We present the research gaps by identifying and analyzing the key architectural requirements and management issues in IoT infrastructures. Finally, we highlight various challenges and a range of promising opportunities for future research to provide a roadmap for addressing the weaknesses and identifying the benefits from the potentials offered by SDN-based IoT solutions.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Transient stability and supply disturbances are common yet unwelcome phenomena in power distribution systems, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. The growing demand for greater reliability and dependability in power delivery has aroused the interest of researchers and renewed the pursuit of advanced technological solutions for fault detection and location determination at medium and low-voltage levels. The length of the distribution network typically ranges from hundreds to thousands of kilometers. In this regard, the management of distribution networks, including the identification of faulty segments, is a significant recurrent challenge facing power-system operators. With the ever-expanding distribution network and regulatory demands for service reliability, the challenge for network operators is daunting. However, the deployment of IoT technologies in the energy distribution infrastructure would significantly accelerate the detection and location of faults, thus transforming the electricity delivery service into one that is responsive, communicative, attractive, and robust. This study proposes, designs, and implements a reasonably priced LoRaWAN-based IoT platform for monitoring distribution networks. The study was conducted in Nakuru County, Kenya on an actual and active distribution network owned and managed by Kenya Power Company. Experimental results showed that a trigger is generated at the network-monitoring center in about 100 ms of the occurrence of a fault on the distribution network, thus enabling quick, prompt, and immediate commencement of reparative action. Furthermore, practical evaluation has shown that this platform is well adapted for the context of developing countries where budgetary constraints and cost prohibitions hinder the upgrade of the legacy grid into fully-fledged smart entities.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"As the growth of IoT networks increases exponentially, the number of cyber attacks is also increasing on IoT networks day-by-day. This results in the vital requirement of cyber security mechanisms to secure IoT networks from cyberattacks. To build such a security mechanism, researchers and cybersecurity practitioners need relevant IoT datasets. However, until now, only a few publicly available IoT network intrusion datasets exist in the literature. Moreover, these datasets lack coverage of IoT network traffic containing IoT application layer protocols like AMQP, XMPP, STOMP, etc. and various IoT-based attacks. So, in this work, we generate a new realistic and comprehensive IoT network intrusion dataset called MU-IoT for IoT cybersecurity. The network traffic contained in the MU-IoT dataset is collected from the Manipur University (MU) IoT Smart Lab, which is our own IoT network testbed. The testbed includes more than 30 devices, which include both physical and emulated IoT devices, and general-purpose devices such as laptops, desktops, servers, etc., that are usually present in a Smart Lab. The dataset contains normal network traffic generated from various applications and attack network traffic comprised of 16 attack types, including IoT-based attacks, which are categorized into six categories. From the testbed, we collected 22.8 GB of raw network data and extracted 15.8 GB of preprocessed network data by using our own feature extraction approach. The preprocessed network data contains 121 flow-based features and 3 class labels of more than 34.8 million records. Additionally, this dataset covers extensive IoT-specific application protocols and a variety of normal network behaviours, which is a notable advantage over existing datasets. The MU-IoT dataset can be utilized to develop and validate machine learning-based Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Systems (IDMS). Moreover, the MU-IoT dataset helps to validate the centralized and federated learning-based IDMS. In addition, we also include the prior exploratory data analysis with the ranking of the features given by various feature selection algorithms as well as from our own feature ranking approach and the performance given by some common machine learning algorithms, as a future reference to the research community. The MU-IoT dataset is publicly available in the link https://manipuruniv.ac.in/CSDmuIOTdataset/.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"The real-time communication requirement of the Internet of Things (IoT) applications promotes the convergence of IoT and Mobile Edge Computing (MEC). The MEC paradigm greatly shortens the IoT service delay by leveraging cloudlets (edge servers) of MEC in the proximity of IoT devices. Considering limited computing and storage resources in an MEC network, it is challenging to provide efficient IoT-enabled service provisioning in such a network. In this article, we study the service home identification problem of service provisioning for multi-source IoT applications in an MEC network, by identifying a service home (cloudlet) of each multi-source IoT application for its data processing, querying and storage. Each multi-source IoT application consists of multiple sources located at different geographical locations and each source uploads its data stream via a gateway (its nearby access point) to the MEC network and the uploaded data then is aggregated with the stream data of the other sources of the IoT application at the service home. We here focus on two novel service home identification problems: the service operational cost minimization problem with the aim to minimize the total service operational cost by admitting as many multi-source IoT applications as possible, and the online throughput maximization problem with the aim to maximize the number of multi-source IoT application requests admitted. We first show that both the problems are NP-hard. We then formulate an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) solution to the service operational cost minimization problem, and propose a randomized algorithm with high probability and a deterministic approximation algorithm respectively, at moderate resource capacity violations. We third develop an efficient heuristic algorithm for the problem without any resource violation. Furthermore, we deal with the online throughput maximization problem under an assumption that multi-source IoT application requests arrive one by one without the knowledge of future arrivals, for which we formulate an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) solution to its offline version, followed by devising an online algorithm with competitive ratio. We finally evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms through experimental simulations. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms are promising, and outperform their comparison counterparts.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Although the Internet of Things (IoT) can increase efficiency and productivity through intelligent and remote management, it also increases the risk of cyber-attacks. The potential threats to IoT applications and the need to reduce risk have recently become an interesting research topic. It is crucial that effective Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) tailored to IoT applications be developed. Such IDSs require an updated and representative IoT dataset for training and evaluation. However, there is a lack of benchmark IoT and IIoT datasets for assessing IDSs-enabled IoT systems. This paper addresses this issue and proposes a new data-driven IoT/IIoT dataset with the ground truth that incorporates a label feature indicating normal and attack classes, as well as a type feature indicating the sub-classes of attacks targeting IoT/IIoT applications for multi-classification problems. The proposed dataset, which is named TON_IoT, includes Telemetry data of IoT/IIoT services, as well as Operating Systems logs and Network traffic of IoT network, collected from a realistic representation of a medium-scale network at the Cyber Range and IoT Labs at the UNSW Canberra (Australia). This paper also describes the proposed dataset of the Telemetry data of IoT/IIoT services and their characteristics. TON_IoT has various advantages that are currently lacking in the state-of-the-art datasets: i) it has various normal and attack events for different IoT/IIoT services, and ii) it includes heterogeneous data sources. We evaluated the performance of several popular Machine Learning (ML) methods and a Deep Learning model in both binary and multi-class classification problems for intrusion detection purposes using the proposed Telemetry dataset.\",\n",

The participating nodes in IoT networks are usually resource-constrained, which makes them luring targets for cyber attacks. In this regard, extensive efforts have been made to address the security and privacy issues in IoT networks primarily through traditional cryptographic approaches. However, the unique characteristics of IoT nodes render the existing solutions insufficient to encompass the entire security spectrum of the IoT networks. Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques, which are able to provide embedded intelligence in the IoT devices and networks, can be leveraged to cope with different security problems. In this paper, we systematically review the security requirements, attack vectors, and the current security solutions for the IoT networks. We then shed light on the gaps in these security solutions that call for ML and DL approaches. Finally, we discuss in detail the existing ML and DL solutions for addressing different security problems in IoT networks. We also discuss several future research directions for ML- and DL-based IoT security.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"The next wave of wireless technologies is proliferating in connecting things among themselves as well as to humans. In the era of the Internet of Things (IoT), billions of sensors, machines, vehicles, drones, and robots will be connected, making the world around us smarter. The IoT will encompass devices that must wirelessly communicate a diverse set of data gathered from the environment for myriad new applications. The ultimate goal is to extract insights from this data and develop solutions that improve quality of life and generate new revenue. Providing large-scale, long-lasting, reliable, and near real-time connectivity is the major challenge in enabling a smart connected world. This paper provides a comprehensive survey on existing and emerging communication solutions for serving IoT applications in the context of cellular, wide-area, as well as non-terrestrial networks. Specifically, wireless technology enhancements for providing IoT access in the fifth-generation (5G) and beyond cellular networks, and communication networks over the unlicensed spectrum are presented. Aligned with the main key performance indicators of 5G and beyond 5G networks, we investigate solutions and standards that enable energy efficiency, reliability, low latency, and scalability (connection density) of current and future IoT networks. The solutions include grant-free access and channel coding for short-packet communications, non-orthogonal multiple access, and on-device intelligence. Further, a vision of new paradigm shifts in communication networks in the 2030s is provided, and the integration of the associated new technologies like artificial intelligence, non-terrestrial networks, and new spectra is elaborated. In particular, the potential of using emerging deep learning and federated learning techniques for enhancing the efficiency and security of IoT communication are discussed, and their promises and challenges are introduced. Finally, future research directions toward beyond 5G IoT networks are pointed out.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Although quantum computing is still in its nascent age, its evolution threatens the most popular public-key encryption systems. Such systems are essential for today's Internet security due to their ability for solving the key distribution problem and for providing high security in insecure communications channels that allow for accessing websites or for exchanging e-mails, financial transactions, digitally signed documents, military communications or medical data. Cryptosystems like Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA), elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) or Diffie-Hellman have spread worldwide and are part of diverse key Internet standards like Transport Layer Security (TLS), which are used both by traditional computers and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. It is especially difficult to provide high security to IoT devices, mainly because many of them rely on batteries and are resource constrained in terms of computational power and memory, which implies that specific energy-efficient and lightweight algorithms need to be designed and implemented for them. These restrictions become relevant challenges when implementing cryptosystems that involve intensive mathematical operations and demand substantial computational resources, which are often required in applications where data privacy has to be preserved for the long term, like IoT applications for defense, mission-critical scenarios or smart healthcare. Quantum computing threatens such a long-term IoT device security and researchers are currently developing solutions to mitigate such a threat. This article provides a survey on what can be called post-quantum IoT systems (IoT systems protected from the currently known quantum computing attacks): the main post-quantum cryptosystems and initiatives are reviewed, the most relevant IoT architectures and challenges are analyzed, and the expected future trends are indicated. Thus, this article is aimed at providing a wide view of post-quantum IoT security and give useful guidelines to the future post-quantum IoT developers.\",\n",

The realization of IoT systems will enable seamless integration of the cyber world with our physical world and will fundamentally change and empower human interaction with the world. A key technology in the realization of IoT systems is middleware, which is usually described as a software system designed to be the intermediary between IoT devices and applications. In this paper, we first motivate the need for an IoT middleware via an IoT application designed for real-time prediction of blood alcohol content using smartwatch sensor data. This is then followed by a survey on the capabilities of the existing IoT middleware. We further conduct a thorough analysis of the challenges and the enabling technologies in developing an IoT middleware that embraces the heterogeneity of IoT devices and also supports the essential ingredients of composition, adaptability, and security aspects of an IoT system.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Modern buildings are increasingly getting connected by adopting a range of IoT devices and applications from video surveillance and lighting to people counting and access control. It has been shown that rich connectivity can make building networks more exposed to cyberattacks and, hence, difficult to manage. Currently, there is no systematic approach for evaluating or enforcing cybersecurity of building systems with a large number of heterogeneous IoT devices. In this article, we aim to enhance cybersecurity of a large-scale IoT infrastructure by formally capturing the expected behavior of the system using the static profile of devices\\u2019 intended usage, buildings information, and network configurations (predeployment) along with dynamic diagnosis (post-deployment) of network activity using machine-learning models. Our contributions are threefold: 1) we develop a tool that automatically generates a formal ontology of network communications for a connected infrastructure by taking a description of buildings (in the form of Brick schema), device network behavior (in the form of manufacturer usage description (MUD) specifications, MUD profile), and network configurations (address, port, and VLAN) as inputs. We contribute our tool as opensource, and apply it to a subset of our university smart campus testbed, covering 20 IoT devices of three types deployed in seven different buildings. We translate the formal model into network flow rules and enforce them to the network at runtime using programmable networking techniques; 2) we, then, measure the network activity of device-specific flow rules and diagnose their health using a set of trained anomaly detection models (one-class classifiers) each corresponding to a particular type of device and specific building location, and demonstrate how our method detects attacks with reasonable accuracy of 92.5%; and (3) finally, we demonstrate three types of location-defined network policies (deployment, administrative, and organizational) that can be verified by this formal model.\",\n",

In addition, a large number of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites are to be deployed to connect IoT devices (actuators and sensors) that are beyond terrestrial network coverage. However, there are the two major LEO satellites' hindering issues: 1) spectrum inefficiency leading to high cost and 2) continuous motions of satellites that limit the contact time to approximately 10 min which results in frequent handovers, link budget limitations, and high Doppler effects. This article discusses design approaches and principles that allow us to develop a cost-effective intelligent data-aided satellite communication and control framework for LEO networks by employing key features of 6G multiconnectivity, distributed sensing, and machine learning algorithms. Our ideas are evaluated with preliminary analytic modeling and simulation results.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Tiny batteryless Internet of Things (IoT) devices that depend on the harvested energy from their environment provide a promising alternative for a sustainable IoT vision. These devices use small capacitors as energy storage, which together with the unpredictable and dynamic harvesting environment results in intermittent on\\u2013off behavior of the device. The crucial issue to effectively use batteryless IoT devices is to find a way of enabling the successful execution of application tasks in face of this intermittency. As the conventional computing models cannot handle this behavior, in this article, we present an energy-aware task scheduler for batteryless IoT devices based on dependencies and priorities, which can intelligently schedule the application tasks avoiding power failures and maintaining forward progress. With the properly defined voltage thresholds for each application task, using our energy-aware task scheduler a safer execution can be ensured. We evaluate our approach based on emulated and real experiments and validate it using two types of power management units (PMUs) (environment emulator and intelligent PMU based on the AEM10941 chip). Our results show that the energy-aware task scheduler is able to react and adapt the execution to environmental changes, avoiding power failures. Comparing to the state-of-the-art scheduling approaches, which are mostly not aware of the energy, we show that our energy-aware task scheduler can keep the device on during the full time of the experiment, executing more tasks when a relatively small capacitor of 10 mF or less is used at harvesting currents as low as  $40 ~\\\\mu \\\\text{A}$ .\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"The Internet of Things (IoT) is the next era of communication. Using the IoT, physical objects can be empowered to create, receive, and exchange data in a seamless manner. Various IoT applications focus on automating different tasks and are trying to empower the inanimate physical objects to act without any human intervention. The existing and upcoming IoT applications are highly promising to increase the level of comfort, efficiency, and automation for the users. To be able to implement such a world in an ever-growing fashion requires high security, privacy, authentication, and recovery from attacks. In this regard, it is imperative to make the required changes in the architecture of the IoT applications for achieving end-to-end secure IoT environments. In this paper, a detailed review of the security-related challenges and sources of threat in the IoT applications is presented. After discussing the security issues, various emerging and existing technologies focused on achieving a high degree of trust in the IoT applications are discussed. Four different technologies, blockchain, fog computing, edge computing, and machine learning, to increase the level of security in IoT are discussed.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"The Internet of Things (IoT) is increasingly being used in applications ranging from precision agriculture to critical national infrastructure by deploying a large number of resource-constrained devices in hostile environments. These devices are being exploited to launch attacks in cyber systems. As a result, security has become a significant concern in the design of IoT-based applications. In this article, we present a security architecture for IoT networks by leveraging the underlying features supported by software-defined networks (SDNs). Our security architecture not only restricts network access to authenticated IoT devices but also enforces fine granular policies to secure the flows in the IoT network infrastructure. The authentication is achieved using a lightweight protocol to authenticate IoT devices. Authorization is achieved using a dynamic policy driven approach. Such an integrated security approach involving authentication of IoT devices and enables authorized flows to protect IoT networks from malicious IoT devices and attacks. We have implemented and validated our architecture using ONOS SDN Controller and Raspbian Virtual Machines, and demonstrated how the proposed security mechanisms can counteract malware packet injection, DDoS attacks using Mirai, spoofing/masquerading, and man-in-the-middle attacks. An analysis of the security and performance of the proposed security mechanisms and their applications is presented in this article.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the main features in 5G. Low-power wide-area networking (LPWAN) has attracted enormous research interests to enable large-scale deployment of IoT, with the design objectives of low cost, wide coverage area, as well as low-power consumption. In particular, a long battery lifetime is essential since many of the IoT devices will be deployed in hard-to-access locations. Prediction of the battery lifetime depends on the accurate modeling of energy consumption. This article presents a comprehensive power consumption model for battery lifetime estimation, which is based on user equipment (UE) states and procedures, for two cellular IoT technologies: 1) Narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) and 2) long-term evolution for machines (LTE-M). A measurement testbed has been set up and the proposed model has been tested and validated via extensive measurements under various traffic patterns and network scenarios, achieving the modeling inaccuracy within 5%. The measurement results show that the battery lifetime of an IoT device can reach up to ten years as required by 3GPP, with proper configuration of the traffic profile, the coverage scenario, as well as the network configuration parameters.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Internet of Things Driven Data Analytics (IoT-DA) has the potential to excel data-driven operationalisation of smart environments. However, limited research exists on how IoT-DA applications are designed, implemented, operationalised, and evolved in the context of software and system engineering life-cycle. This article empirically derives a framework that could be used to systematically investigate the role of software engineering (SE) processes and their underlying practices to engineer IoT-DA applications. First, using existing frameworks and taxonomies, we develop an evaluation framework to evaluate software processes, methods, and other artefacts of SE for IoT-DA. Secondly, we perform a systematic mapping study to qualitatively select 16 processes (from academic research and industrial solutions) of SE for IoT-DA. Thirdly, we apply our developed evaluation framework based on 17 distinct criterion (a.k.a. process activities) for fine-grained investigation of each of the 16 SE processes. Fourthly, we apply our proposed framework on a case study to demonstrate development of an IoT-DA healthcare application. Finally, we highlight key challenges, recommended practices, and the lessons learnt based on framework's support for process-centric software engineering of IoT-DA. The results of this research can facilitate researchers and practitioners to engineer emerging and next-generation of IoT-DA software applications.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"Internet-of-Things (IoTs) entity discovery plays an important role in the Industrial IoTs, especially with the rapidly increasing and updating of IoT sensors in the industrial environment driven by the era of Industry 4.0 and intelligent manufacturing. However, large numbers of nonsmart sensors are required in the industrial environment, causing IoT entity discovery challenges. Unlike the smart sensor, the nonsmart sensor with limited computation and communication ability is hard to discover and recognize by traditional IoT platforms. Aiming at the challenge, this work proposes a novel IoT entity discovery middleware for nonsmart sensor discovery in the industrial environment. The proposed middleware combines both sensor knowledge graphs and sensor data values to build an IoT entity discovery and recognition model. A knowledge\\u2013data fused learning network is proposed for the model to identify the data type, function, and other information of the nonsmart sensor. At last, a prototype middleware with the discovery and recognition model is produced to implement nonsmart sensor discovery. In the experimental evaluations, the prototype middleware tests various nonsmart sensors and achieves 87.6% recognition accuracy. In real-world case studies, the prototype middleware proves the feasibility and effectiveness of nonsmart sensor discovery in the industrial environment.\",\n",

Wi-Fi-based communication is the most preferred choice in wireless IoT systems due to its accessibility, high bandwidth, affordability, and versatility. However, security vulnerabilities in IoT devices pose considerable risks, especially in industrial and critical applications. This paper presents a novel technique to detect jamming in IoT, focusing on communication and environmental dynamics in industrial settings. To better examine the communication conditions and jamming in the industrial production environment, it initially focuses on collecting quality of service (QoS) and connection parameters during normal communication and jamming attacks in production lines equipped with wireless IoT devices with server-client architecture. Experimental findings demonstrate the strikingly profound impact of spot jamming on the upper layers of the protocol stack, revealing that jamming attacks on the physical layer can trigger cascading failures at the transport and application layers. This study presents an innovative stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based model for jamming detection that uses parameters from multiple layers. The proposed LSTM model demonstrates remarkable accuracy in predicting jamming attacks and exhibits robust performance in real-time IoT applications. The model is trained on a carefully curated dataset and tested on a real-time experimental testbed with various types of jamming attacks. The results yielded a jamming detection accuracy of 99.5% and a precision of 99.4%. This research sheds light on the impact of jamming attacks in IoT systems and presents an advanced detection model that shows promising results in mitigating such threats.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the network of devices which contain electronics, sensors or software that enables them to connect at anytime and anywhere through a cyber-physical system. Before the establishment of such a system, it should be considered to what extent the users are ready to adopt and use it in their daily routines. Therefore, this paper explores users' attitudes towards using IoT technologies to receive healthcare services. This is in contrast to most previous research, which has studied the technical requirements or devices of the IoT that are required in healthcare services, or ways in which connectivity and performance can be improved using the IoT. Based on known models of technology acceptance, an integrated framework was developed to investigate the impact of security and privacy concerns, and familiarity with the technology, on users' trust in the IoT, and then to measure the effect of that trust on Omani users' attitudes regarding use of IoT technologies to receive healthcare services. This framework enabled the measurement of risk perception as a mediator between user trust and their attitudes towards using the IoT. Data were collected from 387 respondents and were analysed using SPSS 25 and AMOS 25 statistics software. Exploratory and confirmatory analysis and structural equation modelling were applied. The findings showed that levels of security, privacy and familiarity affected trust in the IoT. Furthermore, these levels of trust in the IoT were found to affect both users' perceptions of risk in, and their attitude towards, using the IoT. The users' risk perception partially mediated the relations between users' trust and their attitude regarding use of the IoT. The framework was supported and interpreted by 40 per cent of the variance in the attitude towards using the IoT in healthcare, while the mediator showed 47 per cent of the variance in the attitude towards using the IoT in healthcare.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"As the IoT adoption is growing in several fields, cybersecurity attacks involving low-cost end-user devices are increasing accordingly, undermining the expected deployment of IoT solutions in a broad range of scenarios. To address this challenge, emerging Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Software Defined Networking (SDN) technologies can introduce new security enablers, thereby endowing IoT systems and networks with higher degree of scalability and flexibility required to cope with the security of massive IoT deployments. In this sense, honeynets can be enhanced with SDN and NFV support, to be applied into IoT scenarios thereby strengthening the overall security. IoT honeynets are virtualized services simulating real IoT networks deployments, so that attackers can be distracted from the real target. In this paper, we present a novel mechanism leveraging SDN and NFV aimed to autonomously deploy and enforce IoT honeynets. The system follows a security policy-based approach that facilitates management, enforcement and orchestration of the honeynets and it has been successfully implemented and tested in the scope of H2020 EU project ANASTACIA, showing its feasibility to mitigate cyber-attacks.\",\n",

      "      \"abstract\": \"The Internet of things (IoT) introduces emerging applications (i.e., smart homes, smart cities, smart health, and smart gird) that assist the traditional infrastructure environments to be connected with smart objects. Things are connected with the Internet and numerous new IoT devices are developing at a rapid pace. As these smart objects are connected and able to communicate with each other in unprotected environments; therefore, the whole communication ecosystem requires security solutions at different levels. IoT technology possesses unique characteristics with various resource constraints and heterogeneous network protocol requirements, unlike traditional networks. The attacker exploits numerous security vulnerabilities of an IoT infrastructure, to generate a DDoS attack. The increase in DDoS attacks has made it important to address the consequences which imply in the IoT industry. This research proposes an SD-IoT based framework that provides security services to the IoT network. We developed a C-DAD (Counter-based DDoS Attack Detection) application that is based on counter values of different network parameters, which helps to detect DDoS attack successfully. C-DAD is a dynamic and programmable solution, and is deeply tested with different network parameters. The algorithm demonstrates a good performance with better results through SDN. Moreover, the proposed framework detects the attack efficiently in a minimum amount of time and with lesser consumption of CPU and memory resources.\",\n",
