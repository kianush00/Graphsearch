Asia continued to account for the largest losses to the softwareindustry, some dlrs 3.9 billion in 1997, up 3 percent increase from1996, the alliance said.   But it said that of total software installed in Asia last year,the percentage of pirated software dropped 3 percentage points to52 percent, ``mostly because of increased anti-piracy efforts.''   This percentage _ the piracy rate _ was as high as 98 percent inVietnam and China and 93 percent in Indonesia, it said.   Elsewhere in Asia, it added, the rate was 70 percent inMalaysia, 69 percent in India, 34 percent in New Zealand, and 32percent in Japan and Australia.

      "raw text: ENGLISHgovernment protection against intellectual property (IP) theft. InSoutheast Asia, where the piracy rates are alarming, the calls forhelp are often rooted in desperation. Bear in mind that this is anindustry dealing with goods that are ridiculously easy toreproduce.   There are many ways to get the undivided attention of theauthorities and the public. Recently, the Business SoftwareAlliance (BSA) announced the findings of a study to show peoplewhat is in it for them if piracy is lowered.   Conducted by Price Waterhouse (PW), the research shows how thepackaged software industry contributes to the economies ofIndonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand andVietnam.   Packaged software covers business applications and leisureprograms.   Examples of business software are operating systems, wordprocessors, spreadsheets, graphics, database management,computer-aided design and computer-aided engineering products, andnetworking software. Leisure programs include games, entertainmentand educational software. The study excludes customised software.   Piracy is defined as `unauthorised copying and distribution ofcopyrighted software products'.   The BSA-PW report on the study offers persuasive arguments as towhy everybody (except maybe, the pirates) are better off withoutsoftware piracy, described as a `major drag' on the industry'sgrowth. Using 1996 figures, the report argues that the industry issignificant in terms of jobs and the government revenue it hascreated. This is followed with projected corresponding figuresuntil the year 2001. The final part discusses the impact of piracyand how it would be if the piracy rate was lower.   According to the report, the Malaysian packaged softwareindustry accounted for US$298 million (US$1 &QC; RM3.80) in sales andUS$544.5 million intotal economic activity in 1996. That year, it provided 3,656 jobsin software and supporting industries, and generated US$78.5million in direct and indirect taxes.   Between 1996 and 2001, the industry is expected to grow at anaverage annual rate of 17.4 per cent, resulting in sales ofUS$664.6 million and stimulating US$1.2 billion in economicactivity by 2001. These sales will create 5,548 jobs. Thegovernment is projected to collect US$175 million from thisexpansion.   What happens if the Malaysian piracy rate - 80 per cent in 1996-falls to the current US rate of 27 per cent? This leads to themost compelling and interesting segment of the study.   (The folks at BSA will tell you that the only acceptable piracyrate is zero per cent, but PW picks the US rate as a realistic andpractical point of reference.) If Malaysia's piracy rate in 1996was 27 per cent instead of 80, there would have been an additional4,007 jobs and the government would have been richer by US$86million. By the year 2001, the packaged software industry couldaccount for 11,628 jobs and US$366.8 million in tax revenues.   Says the report, `In sum, software piracy harms the Malaysianeconomy, curtails economic growth, constrains employment and limitstax contributions to the government.'\n",

The hot line will allow informants to receive cash rewards forcalling in the names of businesses suspected of selling or usingpirated versions of Microsoft software products.   The hot line will be publicized as part of a public awarenesscampaign on the negative effects that software piracy has onThailand's economy, Microsoft executives said at a news conference.   ``Depending on the results of our investigations, a callerstands to gain up to 250,000 baht (dlrs 6,940) for his or herservices,'' Microsoft public relations officer Alex Mercer said.   Weak intellectual property laws and corrupt police contribute tothe trade in pirated software in Thailand, which industry sourcessay accounts for as much as 84 percent of software sales.   Illustrating the enormity of its battle against piracy inThailand, Microsoft attorney Ron Eckstrom estimated that illegallycopied software accounts for 99 percent of sales at a Bangkokshopping mall specializing in computer products.   The Business Software Alliance, a worldwide organization ofsoftware companies, already has a hot line in Thailand to combatpiracy, and Microsoft said its separate program would work closelywith the BSA.   Eckstrom admitted that past efforts to persuade Thais to helpfight piracy have been stymied by a public perception that softwaremakers are foreign companies making huge profits from Thailand.   But the Microsoft attorney said the country's economic downturnand a recently completed report estimating that software piracyrobs Thailand of thousands of jobs and millions of dollars in taxrevenue could change public opinion.   ``As the economy repairs itself here, there is a growingawareness that intellectual property rights must be protected toattract outside investment,'' Eckstrom said.   Microsoft's anti-piracy campaign will not target private usersof illegally copied software because the company has determinedthat the vast majority of pirated software purchases are made bybusinesses, Eckstrom said.\n",

Instead, asvice-president of American publishing software maker Adobe SystemsInc, he was in Malaysia attending to business, which includedspreading the anti-piracy gospel.   That day, he was at a function held to announce key findings ofa study on the Southeast Asian software industry. `I have incurredthe wrath of my wife by putting off the celebration to be here inKL. Looks like I'll have to make it up with a more expensive dinnerand all that,' he says.   His remark on the price of placing work before domestic demandswas, of course, Freeman's way of injecting a little levity into asombre event.   But he was dead serious when talking about the cost of softwarepiracy. 'I believe if the Southeast Asian piracy rate was equal tothat of the United States, Adobe's income (in the region) would bethree to four times what it is now,' he complains.   According to estimates by international industry watchdogBusiness Software Alliance (BSA), the software piracy rates ofcountries in this region are among the highest in the world. In1996, 84 per cent of the PC business software used or sold inSoutheast Asia comprised unauthorised copies with a market value ofalmost US$600 million (US$1 &QC; RM3.80).   Malaysia's rate was 80 per cent (See Table 1). In comparison,the US piracy level is currently 27 per cent. (Adobe Systems is aBSA member, as are other big players such as Autodesk Inc, BentleySystems Inc, Lotus Development Corporation, Microsoft Corporation,Novell Inc and Symantec Corporation.) BSA commissioned PriceWaterhouse to research the contribution of the packaged softwareindustry to the Southeast Asian economies. The exercise wascompleted last December.   BSA president Robert Holleyman singled out two conclusions. One,the industry is significant - more than previously thought -throughout the region in terms of jobs and revenue created. Andtwo, it will become even more significant as governments step upanti-piracy enforcement.   Piracy is without doubt a pivotal issue in the Malaysiansoftware business (as it is in the rest of the region). One cannotdiscuss the industry without mentioning the `P' word.   To a significant extent, the success of the Multimedia SuperCorridor (MSC) project rests upon adequate intellectual property(IP) protection.   This is precisely why the government has pledged to become `aregional leader in IP protection and cyberlaws'.   Part of the grand design is to make the MSC a development huband export centre for software. The idea is to nurture over thenext 10 years a crop of local software makers who can competeregionally, if not globally.   To do this, it is important to enlist the help of the foreignsoftware titans. Microsoft instantly comes to mind. While inMalaysia last March, its chairman and CEO, Bill Gates, re-affirmedhis company's support for the MSC but gave scant details. In a NewStraits Times interview, he had this to say about software piracy,`You never win the battle. It's an important issue but it's anissue where the trend is definitely positive.   There have been good steps taken in Malaysia but I certainlywouldn't say that we can relax.' Gates' top guy in Malaysia,Microsoft (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd general manager Benedict Lee, expandson the theme. `If you understand the government's drive totransform the economy from an industrial one to one based oninformation, then you understand that we need to build a newsociety that can create software.   `But if piracy is prevalent, how are we going to attract ouryounger generation into software development? They will think thereis no revenue in it at all.' There are many others observingclosely Malaysia's war against the IP thieves. In its 1998 ForeignTrade Barriers Report released in April, the US TradeRepresentative touched on CD-based digital piracy. While praisingthe Malaysian authorities' crackdown, the report points out someweak spots.   `Nevertheless, the presence and frequency of pirated videotapesand computer\n",

Stuart Eizenstat, undersecretary of state for economic affairs,  cited the Middle East states and even developed countries such as Spain for violating international treaties on intellectual property rights. Testifying before a Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee, he  warned the United States would seek action by the World Trade Organization against countries that did not comply with those agreements. U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky was expected to  announce Friday which countries the United States is closely monitoring for piracy of computer software, videos, CDs, CD-ROMS and digital video discs. ``Where our important commercial interests are threatened we  will not hesitate to use the WTO dispute mechanism to hold others to the same commitments we have to meet,'' Eizenstat said. He told the Foreign Relations subcommittee on international  economic policy that intellectual property piracy cost the U.S. software industry an estimated $11 billion in lost revenues in 1997, the last year for which figures were available. Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., the subcommittee chairman, said the  United States is losing jobs, income and tax revenue to international software piracy. ``If this trend continues, the status of the U.S. software  industry as the world leader is in jeopardy,'' Hagel said. Eizenstat said many people ``who otherwise consider themselves  law-abiding citizens routinely copy software for a family member, friend or co-worker,'' a practice he compared to shoplifting. He said many foreign countries are unwilling to prosecute  violators, even when they are large companies or governments. ``Frankly developing countries are finding this a difficult  task, especially in the enforcement area,'' Eizenstat said. He said piracy rates were intolerably high in the Middle East  and singled out Kuwait as the only WTO member without formal copyright legislation. But he said rates also were excessive in many developed  countries. ``Despite our and the industry's efforts, the rate of piracy of  business software applications in Spain has hovered near 60 percent for two years,'' he said.\n",

      "raw text: Officials call for tougher laws to combat copyright piracy    HONG KONG (AP) _ Officials said Monday they may have to makebuying pirated compact discs illegal as part of Hong Kong's waragainst copyright piracy.   Speaking at a three-day international conference, Secretary forTrade and Industry Brian Chau, said if the government does not seea fall in demand for pirated goods, officials may have to reviewwhether consumers can continue to buy them without fear ofprosecution.   Chau said the government would ensure that ``all relevant issuesare taken into account.''   The Hong Kong official added that regional law enforcementagencies have to cooperate to fight piracy on the Internet. He saidHong Kong has some of the best laws protecting copyright on theInternet.   Authorities in Hong Kong and other territories in the region areunder pressure, particularly from the United States, to do a betterjob of protecting intellectual property. U.S. officials say HongKong has become a production center as well as a distributioncenter since officials in mainland China began cracking down.   U.S. officials last month decided to keep Hong Kong on awatchlist for copyright violation.   Hong Kong last year passed what officials said is one of thetoughest anti-pirating laws in the world. Customs officials alsohave staged several high-profile raids.   In April, officers of Hong Kong's anti-corruption agency seized7 million pirated video CDs and production equipment worth 650million Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 83 million) in the biggestsuch seizure in Hong Kong's history.   Despite the government's efforts to crack down on piracy, noless than 100 shops across the territory still openly sell piratedvideo or music CDs and computer software in shopping malls or onthe street.   These shops sell recently released movies or music discs forabout 35 Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 4.50) each. Popular software,including the soon-to-be-released Windows 98, are sold for afraction of the price of a legitimate copy.   Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa, speaking at the same conference,said the government is committed to cracking down on piracy, butHong Kong ``is a telecommunications center and a leading center forfilm and television production. The demand for cheap piratedoptical discs is considerable and this provides the incentive forpiracy or counterfeiting.''\n",

If such piracy continues to grow, musicians, writers, moviedirectors and many others will lose their jobs as industry profitswither, he predicted. When that day comes, ``you have ended, ineffect, the American intellectual strength that we have had,'' hesaid.   Eisner made a pitch for stronger legal protection ofintellectual property on the second day of the ``High-Tech Summit''organized by the congressional Joint Economic Committee.Intellectual property includes the movies, music, books, softwareand other copyrighted materials that can be passed around theInternet.   ``With the click of a mouse, pirated copies of intellectualproperty can be transmitted around the world,'' Eisner said. ``Theartists who compose and perform music have already beenvictimized.''   As Internet technology improves, ``it will be possible totransmit perfect copies (of movies) without our knowledge,participation or consent,'' he said.   This growing piracy could lead to the financial collapse of theentertainment industry, which would have a broad economic impact,Eisner said. ``American copyright industries lead all majorindustry sectors in foreign sales and exports,'' he said.   Eisner urged Congress to ``explore with us'' the possibility ofrequiring computer manufacturers and Internet service providers toinstall technologies that could look for digital ``watermarks'' oncopyrighted materials. If a consumer tried to download a bootleggedmovie without such a mark, the operation would fail.   Eisner also asked Congress to ``work with governments around theworld to respect our rights.'' He said he wants the federalgovernment to help educate consumers about piracy, saying manypeople don't realize the harm they are doing when they downloadstolen materials.   Eisner wasn't alone in his pleadings Wednesday, At a newsconference, the Business Software Alliance called upon thepresumptive presidential candidates, Vice President Al Gore andGov. George W. Bush of Texas, to take strong anti-piracy positions.   The coalition of top software executives predicted that in thenext five years, two-thirds of all software will be distributedover the Internet, and this ``makes it more important than ever toensure strong copyright protection for computer software.'' Theexecutives pointed to a new study by the International Planning andResearch Corp., which estimated that global software piracy ratewas 36 percent in 1999. But in some countries, the piracy rate wasmore than 90 percent.

      "raw text: 1999-04-29 10:45:08  financial  Microsoft Sues 15 Florida Companies TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. is suing 15 Florida  companies, alleging that they sold counterfeit versions of Windows 95, Windows 98, and other company software. Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft is the world's dominant maker of  personal computer software. Its Windows operating system runs the basic functions of 90 percent of the world's personal computers. The lawsuits filed in federal courts seek unspecified damages  and a judge's order to stop distribution of the software, corporate attorney Nick Psyhogeos said Wednesday. They come at a time when technology crimes are on the rise  throughout Florida, according to police quoted in a company release. ``We're finding a substantial increase of technology-related  crime in the state,'' said Phil Ramer, director of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement's Office of Statewide Intelligence. ``Organized crime rings have begun to include software piracy in their roster of other illegal activities because of the large sums of money that they stand to make.'' Businesses, consumers and the government are the ones who  suffer, company executives said. Software piracy cost Florida 7,186 jobs in 1997 and $490 million  in lost wages, tax revenue and retail sales, said Psyhogeos, citing a Microsoft-commissioned study from International Planning &AMP; Research Corp., a market research company. And counterfeit software, which often has viruses and bugs, does  not come with technical support or warranty protection. Consumers also aren't eligible for software upgrades. The lawsuits filed Friday were against companies in Tampa,  Orlando, Miami and eight other cities in central and South Florida, one of the company's largest anti-piracy initiatives in a single state, executives said. Under federal law, the companies could be liable for as much as  $100,000 for each instance of copyright infringement, said Pam Salzer, a spokeswoman for the company's east region. Microsoft isn't able to estimate how much software piracy costs  the company, but Salzer estimated it's a $2 billion-a-year problem for the industry. Its impact is felt even in Latin America, according to Tony  Viera, a Microsoft attorney in charge of anti-piracy for that region. Two leads for the Florida lawsuits came from Chile and Peru,  Viera said, adding that much illegal software goes overseas from Miami, Texas and California. Two companies in Florida also are being investigated by police.  Felix and Marta Smud, who were arrested in Tampa and had their  home searched Monday, were selling counterfeit Microsoft software for $65 apiece from their home-based company, said detective Bill Todd. The pair were charged with conspiracy and distribution of  illegal software, allegedly shipped the counterfeit products nationwide. The Florida Department of Law Enforcement also searched Proline  Technologies of Clearwater on Tuesday and seized 100 disks, police said. Microsoft has filed more than 100 lawsuits within the last year  in cities across the nation, including New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Virginia, Maryland, California, Chicago, Minnesota and Alabama.                              *------ EDITOR'S NOTE: Customers with questions about the legitimacy of  Microsoft products can call the company's anti-piracy hot line: (800) RU-LEGIT or (800) 785-3448.

      "raw text: HONG KONG MOVIE THEATERS GO DARK TO PROTEST   PIRACY OF FILMS    HONG KONG _ The stars were on glittering display in Hong KongWednesday, though not on the silver screen.   Movie theaters across the territory went dark for the day toprotest the flood of illegally copied films. An array of local filmand pop celebrities led a rally of 2,000 people to demand a toughercrackdown on piracy.   Film producers say the Hong Kong film industry, once one of thelargest exporters of movies after Hollywood, has been devastated bythe explosive growth of movies illegally recorded onto compactdisks.   ``It's a downward spiral,'' said Woody Tsung, the chiefexecutive of the Motion Picture Industry Association. ``The onlyway we can come out of this crisis is if the government gets rid ofpiracy.''   For all the doomsday talk, the protest Wednesday was a bubblyaffair. Jackie Chan, perhaps Hong Kong's biggest star, showed up ina black-suede jacket and matching pants to serve as the unofficialmarshal. As crowds squealed and cameras flashed, it was hard totell the politics and the pop culture apart.   Hong Kong was taken off a watch list by the U.S. government lastmonth after it stepped up efforts to raid factories that produceillegally copied material. But executives here say the formerBritish colony remains one of the worst offenders in Asia forcopyright violations.   The protest rally also included representatives of the music,cable-television and computer-software industries _ all of whomcalled on the Hong Kong government to assign police officers toclose factories that make illegal software and to arrest themerchants who peddle it.   Hong Kong's movie industry, in particular, has been damaged bythe advent of video compact disks, which can be bought for $2 instores or at street stalls, often days before the films arereleased in theaters.   Tsung said the industry did not have reliable figures for howmuch money it loses each year as a result of illegally copiedmovies. But he said the box office revenue of Hong Kong filmsdeclined from $168 million in 1993 to $54 million last year, and heattributed 95 percent of the decline to piracy.   Theater owners said they lost about $250,000 by shutting downcinemas Wednesday. They, too, contend that they are in a battle forsurvival. Five years ago, Hong Kong had 180 cinemas. Today, with somany people buying bootleg disks instead of tickets to the localmultiplex, the number has fallen to 73.   ``It's incredible,'' said Rigo Jesu, an executive at theIntercontinental Group, which distributes films and operatescinemas here. ``I don't know of a situation like this anywhere elsein the world.''   In the deserted lobby of Queen's Theater in central Hong Kong, asign on the box office window apologized for being closed. Itadded: ``Imagine a city without cinemas. If piracy is allowed tocontinue, this will be the result.''   In a signal that the government regards piracy as a grave issue,Hong Kong's chief executive, Tung Chee-hwa, emerged from his officeto accept a petition from the protesters. In a statement, he said:``We will not allow piracy or counterfeiting activities to tarnishHong Kong's reputation.''   On Tuesday, Customs officials conducted raids throughout theterritory and said they seized 350,000 pirated optical disks, worthan estimated $683,000, and arrested 37 suspects. In all of 1998,Hong Kong seized 39 million pirated disks and arrested 1,645people.   But industry executives said Hong Kong must assign the police tocrack down on the merchants who sell pirated software, since theyare too widely dispersed for the 220 Customs officials to handle.   The problem extends beyond movies. More than half the sales ofsome recordings in Hong Kong are generated by illegal copies,according to Frank Brown, the president of MTV Networks Asia.``Hong Kong is amongst the worst in the region, though not as badas India and China,'' Brown said.   Some executives have faulted the United States for lifting thepressure on\n",

      "raw text: 1999-06-10 14:00:28  financial  Record Industry Fights Pirates LONDON (AP) -- The recording industry's attack on music piracy  bit a chunk out of the booming illegal trade last year, but stronger laws and more aggressive prosecution are still needed to make any serious impact, industry enforcers said Thursday. ``Fighting music piracy today means fighting a huge, organized,  illegal international business,'' said Jason Berman, head of the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, which represents 1,300 record companies in 70 countries. ``Our industry dedicates large resources to that fight but we  need, above all else, support of the governments,'' Berman said. Once the bailiwick of backroom bootleggers with a few cassette  copying machines, music piracy has grown into a $4.5 billion industry with sophisticated global distribution networks and close ties to organized crime. In response, the federation formed its international anti-piracy  team in 1997, recruiting investigators and industry experts to sniff out the operations that produce an estimated 2 billion counterfeit CDs and cassettes every year. In 1998, the unit seized more than 60 million illegally produced  CDs -- half of them from Southeast Asia and Latin America -- and closed down major manufacturing plants in North America, Europe, the Middle East and Asia, the federation said. Iain Grant, the organization's head of enforcement, said the  Mafia sometimes uses lucrative bootleg CD operations to finance drug-trafficking and other criminal endeavors. ``You do not need to be a rocket scientist to expect that  organized crime groups worldwide will get involved when there are profits which can be generated at this level,'' Grant said. In April, the federation assisted in the raid of a CD  manufacturing plant in Naples, Italy, that resulted in the arrest of 14 reputed Mafia members and led investigators to various other criminal operations, Grant said. The plant was generating $100,000 a week, he said. Pirated recordings, most often sold at outdoor markets and by  smaller independent shops that run little risk of getting caught, tend to be identifiable by shoddily copied liner art, Berman said. But the sound quality can be as good as the real thing, he  acknowledged. Berman said the organization is hampered by inadequate laws and  relatively light penalties for music piracy. ``No amount of investigative work on our part, no amount of  money, resources, time and effort will succeed in reducing these incredible levels of piracy if governments don't take effective enforcement actions that include both substantial fines and prison sentences,'' he said. The industry has had a harder time stemming illegal music  copying via the Internet. Currently, its only recourse is trying to shut down Internet  sites with cease-and-desist orders, which it has done in thousands of cases. But there are an estimated 400,000 infringing sites left and more coming online every day, the federation said. This battle has resulted in the formation of the Secured Digital  Music Initiative, which seeks to develop a copyright directive that will set ground rules for Internet music commerce, Berman said.\n",

      "raw text: EISNER CALLS FOR WAR ON INTERNET PIRATES   &UR;  &LR; WASHINGTON _ Disney Co. Chairman Michael Eisner urged Congresson Wednesday to protect copyrighted intellectual properties byenacting tough new curbs against piracy on the Internet, includingmandating that computer manufacturers produce hardware withbuilt-in safeguards against hacking.   Using clips from the new Disney animated feature ``Dinosaur'' asa prop, Eisner told an all-star lineup of Senate and House membersat the Capitol luncheon that ``there is no way around it, theft istheft, whether it is enabled by a handgun or a computer keyboard.''   ``We have created a movie (`Dinosaur') that took four years tomake, during which 45 million megabytes were crunched - enough tofill 70,000 CD-ROMs - all to generate data for an 80-minute film,''Eisner said. ``Were it to fall in the wrong hands, it could becompressed onto a single DVD disc in a matter of minutes and put onthe Internet while the movie is still in theaters.''   His announcement came amid growing worries in the entertainmentindustry over the impact of new broadband Internet technology.Broadband, now in an estimated 5 million homes nationwide, allowsfor much faster transmission and downloading of computer data,including digitized movies and music.   Using older Internet technology, it can take up to 24 hours todownload a feature-length film. With broadband, the process cantake 15 minutes.   Eisner specifically asked Congress to mandate that all computerand software manufacturers build anti-hacking systems into theirproducts. He also called for an expanded international crackdown onpiracy.   The Disney chief also announced that the entertainment industryplans to take a leading role in efforts to develop encryption andother security systems ``to stay one step ahead of the hackers.''   Eisner also called for a campaign to educate the public on theevils of copyright infringement. He also advocated a fair pricingpolicy for movies and music that would make pirated copies lessattractive to consumers.   While Eisner expressed confidence that the computer industrywould cooperate with the anti-piracy effort, he noted that someleaders of the high-tech sector are reluctant to put any accessrestrictions on the Internet.   ``I find it disingenuous of computer companies to fightcopyright protections,'' said Eisner.   He warned that failure to curb piracy could lead to the demiseof the Internet. Eisner said that if intellectual properties andincome from such efforts are ``allowed to be pirated away, then thecreative risk takers will put their energies elsewhere and theInternet will become a wonderful delivery system with nothingwonderful to deliver.''   Eisner told the lawmakers that legislation was the only realremedy, adding: ``Would the car companies have put in seat beltswithout a law?''   California Rep. Howard Berman, D-Mission Hills, the House'sleading expert on copyright protection, expressed support forEisner's proposal. He led the fight in 1998 for passage of theDigital Millennium Copyright Act, which bans the manufacture andimport of technology that is specifically designed to facilitatepiracy.   Berman is currently pushing a bill that would step upenforcement of copyright laws by the Justice Department.   ``We need to put more resources and a higher priority on thiseffort,'' Berman said. ``I believe a few high-profile prosecutionscan have a tremendous effect on piracy.''   The film industry's effort to shut out pirates will be led bythe Motion Picture Association of America. Jack Valenti, MPAAchairman and Hollywood's star Washington lobbyist, said Wednesdaythat he is putting together a team of experts ``to put atechnological armor plate around our properties on the Internet.''   Valenti and Eisner said piracy of films is still in its infancy,given the limited access to broadband technology. And many filmsposted on the Internet are of poor quality, including somevideotaped off theater screens.   But both men w\n",
