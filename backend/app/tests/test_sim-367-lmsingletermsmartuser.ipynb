The latest report published by the London-based International Federation of the Phonographic Industry has said that piracy across the Middle East is over 20 percent, and much higher in many cases. The exception is the UAE, where sustained anti-piracy activity has brought the level down to under 10 percent, the Dubai-based Khaleej Times quoted the report as saying Saturday. The Music Piracy '98 report said that music piracy level was 10-25 percent in Qatar and 25-50 percent in the rest of Gulf Cooperation Council countries, such as Saudi Arabia, Oman, Kuwait and Bahrain. Anti-piracy campaigners in Dubai, the second largest emirate of the UAE, said that in the Middle East, music cassette piracy was especially high, but audio-piracy rate had fallen dramatically since it was brought under control in the country in 1994. According to the federation, which represents the global recording industry, Israel is now a major cause for concern in the region, with a domestic piracy level of 60 percent. There is further evidence that Israel is a production center for pirate CDs for export, it said.\n",

They said that while the government was trying to develop Colombo as a transshipment port in the South Asian region, wrong signals were being sent to the international shipping community that Sri Lanka was not a safe place for transshipment activity. Additionally it is feared that the frequency of ships calling at Colombo would be reduced if piracy was allowed to continue since the laws and procedures currently in place were inadequate and inappropriate to deal with piracy. International shipping agencies have cautioned at the increase in piracy in many parts of the world. The estimated loss due to piracy has been placed at 200 million US dollars in 1996.\n",

Six countries, including three in Asia, accounted for nearly 57 percent of the global losses, a study by the Washington-based Business Software Alliance showed.    Piracy in the United States cost software makers worldwide dlrs 2.8 billion, and piracy in China cost them dlrs 1.5 billion in China, the alliance said.    It said the costs amounted to dlrs 752 million in Japan, dlrs 582 million in South Korea, dlrs 509 million in Germany, and dlrs 408 million in France.    Asia continued to account for the largest losses to the software industry, some dlrs 3.9 billion in 1997, up 3 percent increase from 1996, the alliance said.    But it said that of total software installed in Asia last year, the percentage of pirated software dropped 3 percentage points to 52 percent, ``mostly because of increased anti-piracy efforts.''    This percentage _ the piracy rate _ was as high as 98 percent in Vietnam and China and 93 percent in Indonesia, it said.    Elsewhere in Asia, it added, the rate was 70 percent in Malaysia, 69 percent in India, 34 percent in New Zealand, and 32 percent in Japan and Australia.    The rate also dropped 3 percentage points globally last year, it said.    Eastern Europe again had the highest piracy rate, although it decreased from 80 percent to 77 percent in 1997, the alliance said.    The rates in Bulgaria, the Commonwealth of Independent States and Russia were all above 89 percent.    Piracy declined in Western Europe, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa, while in North America it held at 28 percent, the alliance said.\n",

      "raw text: 2000-04-10   Malaysia Committed to Fighting Piracy  Malaysia Monday committed itself to fighting software piracy with enforced laws. Malaysia's commitment to fighting piracy is incorporated into our government's bill of guarantees for MSC (Multimedia Super Corridor) status companies in which we commit ourselves to becoming the regional leader in intellectual property protection and cyber laws, Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said when opening the Asia Software Policy Summit here. The two-day software policy meeting will tackle the issues of intellectual property protection and software piracy which are plaguing the region and inhibiting economic growth. The Malaysian Cabinet has recently approved the tabling of the Optical Disc Act in parliament which will strengthen and complement existing legislation such as the Copyright Act in the protection of intellectual property, Abdullah said. The proposed act will impose stiffer punishment on violators of intellectual property and will give the relevant authorities greater regulatory powers such as confiscating equipment used to manufacture pirated goods, he added. The deputy prime minister said the Malaysian government is continuously looking at ways to strengthen intellectual property laws to eradicate piracy. Abdullah said that legislation alone is not sufficient in combating piracy, therefore, national strategies to combat piracy must focus on enforcement. In Malaysia, he said, a special copyright task force was set up in March 1999 to strengthen the efforts to combat piracy. The efficacy of the task force has been encouraging, he said, adding from April 1999 to end-March 2000, the task force checked more than 12,000 premises for pirated software, music CDs and video CDs and its activities had resulted in 3,178 cases of piracy and seizures of pirated goods worth 8 million ringgit (2.1 million U.S. dollars). He said the Malaysian government fully recognizes and supports the need for strong intellectual property protection of software to ensure a strong and vibrant software industry.\n",

This was in stark contrast to the overall drop in the piracy rate in the Asia-Pacific region, which declined by 9 percent to 55 percent in the same period, the Philippine News Agency reported today. The reports said the above were the findings of a new independent study of global software piracy by the Business Software Alliance and the Software Publishers' Association. The latest study just underlined how much work remained to be done in the Philippines, says Ron Eckstrom, vice president of the Business Software Alliance, a worldwide piracy watchdog. For this reason, the watchdog intensified its anti-piracy campaigns in the Philippines. In a recent press conference held in the country, it called on the public to help stop the rampant theft of copyrights and launched a series of reward campaigns. The study also showed that of the 523 million new business software applications in use throughout the world last year, some 225 million units -- nearly one in every two -- were pirated. This represented a 20 percent increase over the 1995 estimate of 187 million units, although revenue losses decreased to 11.2 billion U.S. dollars, the study said.\n",

Executives from Microsoft, the world's largest software maker, did not provide specific figures on how much is lost each year from software piracy in China.    ``There is piracy in the U.S., but not as severe as China,'' said Pieter Knook, vice president of Microsoft's Far East region. ``It is clear that software piracy in China is damaging.''

Participants at the regional conference unanimously adopted a document called the Asia Anti-Piracy Challenges 2000 and the  Mode Action Plan in an effort to promote cooperation and coordination, Japan Coast Guard chief Shogo Arai said at a press conference. At the Regional Conference on Combating Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships, participants had valuable discussions on the importance of international cooperation and coordination to eliminate attacks at sea, Arai said. The Asia Anti-Piracy Challenges 2000 spells out the need for Asian countries to help each other in the fields of personnel training and upgrading of equipment and facilities. The document also calls for aggressive exchange of information among the countries as well as periodic meetings among their maritime officials to further facilitate and strengthen cooperation. The Mode Action Plan calls for the reinforcement of self- protection measures in terms of technology and equipment. It also calls for the creation of an effective system of reporting attacks to authorities, cooperation among relevant authorities within a government, and establishment of an international network for the information exchange. The conference to tackle piracy was first suggested last November by then Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi in Manila at an informal regional summit. According to a report by the International Maritime Bureau, more than 30 percent of worldwide piracy cases in the first three months of this year took place in waters off Indonesia.\n",

      "raw text: ENGLISH government protection against intellectual property (IP) theft. In Southeast Asia, where the piracy rates are alarming, the calls for help are often rooted in desperation. Bear in mind that this is an industry dealing with goods that are ridiculously easy to reproduce.    There are many ways to get the undivided attention of the authorities and the public. Recently, the Business Software Alliance (BSA) announced the findings of a study to show people what is in it for them if piracy is lowered.    Conducted by Price Waterhouse (PW), the research shows how the packaged software industry contributes to the economies of Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.    Packaged software covers business applications and leisure programs.    Examples of business software are operating systems, word processors, spreadsheets, graphics, database management, computer-aided design and computer-aided engineering products, and networking software. Leisure programs include games, entertainment and educational software. The study excludes customised software.    Piracy is defined as `unauthorised copying and distribution of copyrighted software products'.    The BSA-PW report on the study offers persuasive arguments as to why everybody (except maybe, the pirates) are better off without software piracy, described as a `major drag' on the industry's growth. Using 1996 figures, the report argues that the industry is significant in terms of jobs and the government revenue it has created. This is followed with projected corresponding figures until the year 2001. The final part discusses the impact of piracy and how it would be if the piracy rate was lower.    According to the report, the Malaysian packaged software industry accounted for US$298 million (US$1 &QC; RM3.80) in sales and US$544.5 million in total economic activity in 1996. That year, it provided 3,656 jobs in software and supporting industries, and generated US$78.5 million in direct and indirect taxes.    Between 1996 and 2001, the industry is expected to grow at an average annual rate of 17.4 per cent, resulting in sales of US$664.6 million and stimulating US$1.2 billion in economic activity by 2001. These sales will create 5,548 jobs. The government is projected to collect US$175 million from this expansion.    What happens if the Malaysian piracy rate - 80 per cent in 1996 -falls to the current US rate of 27 per cent? This leads to the most compelling and interesting segment of the study.    (The folks at BSA will tell you that the only acceptable piracy rate is zero per cent, but PW picks the US rate as a realistic and practical point of reference.) If Malaysia's piracy rate in 1996 was 27 per cent instead of 80, there would have been an additional 4,007 jobs and the government would have been richer by US$86 million. By the year 2001, the packaged software industry could account for 11,628 jobs and US$366.8 million in tax revenues.    Says the report, `In sum, software piracy harms the Malaysian economy, curtails economic growth, constrains employment and limits tax contributions to the government.'\n",

      "raw text: Microsoft strengthens anti-piracy efforts in Thailand In the latest move aimed at curbing the widespread use of illegally copied software, Microsoft announced Monday that is establishing an anti-piracy telephone hot line in Thailand.    The hot line will allow informants to receive cash rewards for calling in the names of businesses suspected of selling or using pirated versions of Microsoft software products.    The hot line will be publicized as part of a public awareness campaign on the negative effects that software piracy has on Thailand's economy, Microsoft executives said at a news conference.    ``Depending on the results of our investigations, a caller stands to gain up to 250,000 baht (dlrs 6,940) for his or her services,'' Microsoft public relations officer Alex Mercer said.    Weak intellectual property laws and corrupt police contribute to the trade in pirated software in Thailand, which industry sources say accounts for as much as 84 percent of software sales.    Illustrating the enormity of its battle against piracy in Thailand, Microsoft attorney Ron Eckstrom estimated that illegally copied software accounts for 99 percent of sales at a Bangkok shopping mall specializing in computer products.    The Business Software Alliance, a worldwide organization of software companies, already has a hot line in Thailand to combat piracy, and Microsoft said its separate program would work closely with the BSA.    Eckstrom admitted that past efforts to persuade Thais to help fight piracy have been stymied by a public perception that software makers are foreign companies making huge profits from Thailand.    But the Microsoft attorney said the country's economic downturn and a recently completed report estimating that software piracy robs Thailand of thousands of jobs and millions of dollars in tax revenue could change public opinion.    ``As the economy repairs itself here, there is a growing awareness that intellectual property rights must be protected to attract outside investment,'' Eckstrom said.    Microsoft's anti-piracy campaign will not target private users of illegally copied software because the company has determined that the vast majority of pirated software purchases are made by businesses, Eckstrom said.\n",

Off U.S. Watch List  The International Intellectual Property Alliance (IIPA) has recommended to the U.S. that the U.A.E be removed from the priority Special 301 watch list because of its great progress in reducing piracy levels. According to a report by Gulf News on Friday, IIPA suggested to the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) that the U.A.E.'s progress be recognized. The U.A.E. has succeeded in reducing piracy levels to 54 percent in 1998 -- almost equal to the European rate, the report said. IIPA suggested that the U.A.E. be downgraded in April to the other observation status which is a prior stage to total removal from the USTR list. The USTR list is divided into Priority Foreign Country, Priority Watch List, other observation status and on recommendation  status. Piracy rate in the U.A.E. was 60 percent in 1997, the lowest in the region. The global estimate by IIPA of trade losses due to piracy show that losses in the U.A.E. dropped to 22.4 million U.S. dollars in 1998 from 27.4 million dollars in 1997. This is excellent news for the U.A.E. and thoroughly justifies all of the government's extensive efforts in fighting copyright piracy, said Ashok Sharma, Middle East Business Software Alliance director. The initial analysis of 1997-98 levels of piracy suggests its piracy rate for business applications will fall yet again from 60 percent to 54 percent, he added. According to the report, IIPA recommended that Israel be put on the highest level as a Priority Foreign Country, while Kuwit, which has no copyright law, be put on the Priority Watch List if it fails to draft laws by April 30. Countries on the watch list include Bahrain, Egypt, India, Jordan, Lebanon, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Palestinian Authority and Pakistan.\n",

Ng Kim Neo, Senior Director, Trade Policy, Singapore's Trade Development Board, said the enforcement authorities in association with Intellectual Property (IP) owner agencies conducted more than 1,800 raids and inspections in the period. The official said that compared to the seizure of 1,482,491 infringing items and the detention of 125 people in 507 raids during the same period of 1998, the results show that enforcement actions have had a positive impact in bringing down the level of IP piracy.

Malaysian Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry Secretary-General Pahamin A. Rajab made the proposal Wednesday as the MPAA's feedback was alleged to have resulted in criticism by the Washington-based International Intellectual Property Alliance (IIPA) that Malaysia had not done enough to check digital piracy of musical and film works on CD, VCD and CD-ROM. The Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry spearheads Malaysia's fight against all forms of piracy of intellectual property. Regretting that the MPAA did not bother to communicate with the ministry, Pahamin told reporters I'm inviting the MPAA to open an office in the country so that we can have rapport and collaborate in tackling the menace. Our doors are always open. He said the MPAA should have emulated Business Software Alliance (BSA) and Recording Industry of Malaysia (RIM) for constantly being in liaison with his ministry to check software and music piracy. The MPAA should appreciate that by not having its representative here could cause a major handicap for the ministry in enforcing anti-piracy measures, he said. He said his ministry would also require representatives of holders of intellectual property rights to authenticate copyrighted works during raids on premises suspected of selling pirated products. Pahamin said without the copyright holder representatives tagging along during such raids, enforcement officers would not be able to discern the original from pirated copy. Pahamin said Malaysia is among the very few countries doggedly determined to wipe out piracy of intellectual property. Pahamin himself heads a ministry special task force to deal with the problem in an integrated approach with the police, customs as well as music and film producers.\n",

Microsoft said in a statement that the Business Software Alliance (BSA), an industrial association established to protect software copyright and prevent software piracy, estimated that last year alone, software piracy resulted in more than 1.21 billion U.S. Dollars in lost sales worldwide. Meanwhile, the company has sent a notice to a range of Zimbabwean businesses on action being taken to curb the practice. The most prevalent form of software piracy in Zimbabwe was the use of unauthorized copies. Pirated software can be incomplete or contain virus. It may create technical problems which cost time and money to fix, said Microsoft's Anti-Piracy Marketing Manager for Africa Fredrik Jonker, Additional drawbacks to the use of illegal software include the inability to get technical support, manuals or product upgrades. Such activity constitutes copyright infringement and carries civil and criminal penalties, Jonker said, adding that these include fines or imprisonment for up to two years or both. In view of economic challenges facing many Zimbabwean companies at present, Jonker said, his company felt there was a need to show its commitment to Zimbabwe by offering a 15 percent discount to all organizations wanting to legalize their software between March 16 and the end of April.\n",

      "raw text: ENGLISH celebrating their 23rd wedding anniversary. Instead, as vice-president of American publishing software maker Adobe Systems Inc, he was in Malaysia attending to business, which included spreading the anti-piracy gospel.    That day, he was at a function held to announce key findings of a study on the Southeast Asian software industry. `I have incurred the wrath of my wife by putting off the celebration to be here in KL. Looks like I'll have to make it up with a more expensive dinner and all that,' he says.    His remark on the price of placing work before domestic demands was, of course, Freeman's way of injecting a little levity into a sombre event.    But he was dead serious when talking about the cost of software piracy. 'I believe if the Southeast Asian piracy rate was equal to that of the United States, Adobe's income (in the region) would be three to four times what it is now,' he complains.    According to estimates by international industry watchdog Business Software Alliance (BSA), the software piracy rates of countries in this region are among the highest in the world. In 1996, 84 per cent of the PC business software used or sold in Southeast Asia comprised unauthorised copies with a market value of almost US$600 million (US$1 &QC; RM3.80).    Malaysia's rate was 80 per cent (See Table 1). In comparison, the US piracy level is currently 27 per cent. (Adobe Systems is a BSA member, as are other big players such as Autodesk Inc, Bentley Systems Inc, Lotus Development Corporation, Microsoft Corporation, Novell Inc and Symantec Corporation.) BSA commissioned Price Waterhouse to research the contribution of the packaged software industry to the Southeast Asian economies. The exercise was completed last December.    BSA president Robert Holleyman singled out two conclusions. One, the industry is significant - more than previously thought - throughout the region in terms of jobs and revenue created. And two, it will become even more significant as governments step up anti-piracy enforcement.    Piracy is without doubt a pivotal issue in the Malaysian software business (as it is in the rest of the region). One cannot discuss the industry without mentioning the `P' word.    To a significant extent, the success of the Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC) project rests upon adequate intellectual property (IP) protection.    This is precisely why the government has pledged to become `a regional leader in IP protection and cyberlaws'.    Part of the grand design is to make the MSC a development hub and export centre for software. The idea is to nurture over the next 10 years a crop of local software makers who can compete regionally, if not globally.    To do this, it is important to enlist the help of the foreign software titans. Microsoft instantly comes to mind. While in Malaysia last March, its chairman and CEO, Bill Gates, re-affirmed his company's support for the MSC but gave scant details. In a New Straits Times interview, he had this to say about software piracy, `You never win the battle. It's an important issue but it's an issue where the trend is definitely positive.    There have been good steps taken in Malaysia but I certainly wouldn't say that we can relax.' Gates' top guy in Malaysia, Microsoft (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd general manager Benedict Lee, expands on the theme. `If you understand the government's drive to transform the economy from an industrial one to one based on information, then you understand that we need to build a new society that can create software.    `But if piracy is prevalent, how are we going to attract our younger generation into software development? They will think there is no revenue in it at all.' There are many others observing closely Malaysia's war against the IP thieves. In its 1998 Foreign Trade Barriers Report released in April, the US Trade Representative touched on CD-based digital piracy. While praising the Malaysian authorities' crackdown, the report points out some weak spots.    `Nevertheless, the presence and frequency of pirated videotapes and computer\n",

Speaking at a press conference, Secretary for Trade and Industry Chau Tak-hay listed a series of new measures which would be studied and considered by his bureau to combat copyright piracy. Among the measures are confiscation of the assets of those convicted of copyright piracy, imposition of closure orders on premises including shops and factories which have been engaged in piracy-related business so that they could not be sold or leased out for a period of time and introduction of some form of legal liability against end-users who purchased pirated optical discs. The bureau is investigating the feasibility of these measures and no conclusion has been reached yet, Chau said. It is of paramount importance to educate consumers that buying pirated optical discs is tantamount to buying stolen goods, he stressed. Chau noted that the judiciary has been handing down heavier sentences for convicted copyright offenders and he welcomed this development. In view of the imminent announcement of the U.S. Special 301 Report, Chau said, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government would be most disappointed if Hong Kong were retained on the Watch List because such action would be unreasonable. Also present at the press conference was Commissioner of Customs and Excise Lawrence Li Shu-fai, who emphasized customs' determination and efforts in combating copyright piracy.\n",

Tsang was speaking at a ceremony in which he received an appreciation plaque from the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) in recognition of the achievements in tackling piracy by his department. These achievements are attributable to the whole-hearted devotion of our officers in the Intellectual Property Investigation Bureau and the Special Task Force, Tsang said. At the presentation ceremony, Tsang announced that the deployment of the Special Task Force set up in June 1999 would be extended to another six months starting from Thursday. He also gave assurance to the IFPI that the Hong Kong customs would continue to do its best to fight against copyright piracy. We have spent 150 million HKD (19.2 million USD) to support our enforcement action in suppressing copyright piracy here in Hong Kong, he said. He noted that there were last year over 1,000 outlets selling pirated CDs in Hong Kong carrying them five million CDs in the retail market at any one time - about a quarter of these CDs falling in the music category. A snapshot today would reveal a market of fewer than 100 retail outlets with less than 100,000 pirated CDs in circulation, depicting a significant reduction of 98 per cent in terms of availability, he added. Tsang stressed that Hong Kong was wholly committed to protecting the rights of the copyright owners. Also speaking at the ceremony, IFPI Chairman Jason Berman paid tribute to Tsang for his outstanding leadership in the fight against music piracy. The record industry not only recognizes the achievement of the Department, but also Mr. Tsang's dedication and determination to solve the problem of music piracy in Hong Kong, Berman said. He noted that although the fight against copyright piracy was still far from over, it was no small achievement on the part of the Hong Kong customs that the market was now in a much better form. We in particularly are impressed by the department's two pronged enforcement strategy, clamping down on both the supply side and the retail end at the same time, Berman said. Berman said, as a result of customs enforcement actions, the sales figures of music products had increased significantly since last year and the industry was able to register growth for the last three quarters. He said the growth in the sales was most encouraging to the record industry, in particularly to local artists whose products were heavily pirated.\n",

The piracy rate in Jordan is 85 percent, in Kuwait 80 percent and in Lebanon 93 percent, said Nasser Ali Khasawneh, BSA's vice president for the Middle East and North Africa. Despite improved legislation in the Arab world, losses due to piracy are still high, said Khasawneh at the ongoing Arab Regional Conference on intellectual property rights held in Beirut. In Saudi Arabia, the figure stood at 40 million U.S. dollars last year and in Egypt at 10 million dollars, according to BSA statistics. Those figures only represent income loss to companies. The true losses would be higher,the official added. The actual losses in Egypt were estimated at 35 million dollars, not 10 million dollars. Every job in the software industry creates nine jobs in related fields,said Khasawneh, adding cutting the piracy rate in Egypt from its current level of 85 percent to 50 percent would create 27,300 jobs in the software industry.

      "raw text: 1998-11-25   China's Fight Against Software Piracy (1)  China has closed 72 compact disks production lines in the past 26 months in an intense fight against software piracy, according to Zou Bian, secretary general of the China Software Alliance (CSA). He says that many of the production lines were designed to manufacture computer software as well as audio and video products and that this piracy is causing at least 10 billion yuan in losses for Chinese software producers every year. A Center of Computer and Microelectronics Industry Development Research (CCID) official says that China's software market is not expected grow this year and revenues will be far lower than the expected figure of 15 billion yuan at the beginning of the year. Industry sources say that in addition to an economic slowdown and shrinking demand, piracy is a factor in this. According to a CSA study, there are 3 pirated copies for every authentic piece of CIBA software on the market. CIBA is a popular brand of software developed by Beijing's Kingsoft Company. Over two-thirds of Chinese software producers regard piracy as the major obstacle to expansion. A China Computer Software and Technology Service's official says that, since software companies have to have a high profit margin to compensate for high risks and costs, they can hardly compete with piracy in pricing. The cost to produce a pirated compact disk is only 2 or 3 yuan (less than one U.S. dollar) so a production line can recover its investment and begin making a profit with pirated software in three months.\n",

Stuart Eizenstat, undersecretary of state for economic affairs,   cited the Middle East states and even developed countries such as  Spain for violating international treaties on intellectual property  rights.  Testifying before a Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee, he   warned the United States would seek action by the World Trade  Organization against countries that did not comply with those  agreements.  U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky was expected to   announce Friday which countries the United States is closely  monitoring for piracy of computer software, videos, CDs, CD-ROMS  and digital video discs.  ``Where our important commercial interests are threatened we   will not hesitate to use the WTO dispute mechanism to hold others  to the same commitments we have to meet,'' Eizenstat said.  He told the Foreign Relations subcommittee on international   economic policy that intellectual property piracy cost the U.S.  software industry an estimated $11 billion in lost revenues in  1997, the last year for which figures were available.  Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., the subcommittee chairman, said the   United States is losing jobs, income and tax revenue to  international software piracy.  ``If this trend continues, the status of the U.S. software   industry as the world leader is in jeopardy,'' Hagel said.  Eizenstat said many people ``who otherwise consider themselves   law-abiding citizens routinely copy software for a family member,  friend or co-worker,'' a practice he compared to shoplifting.  He said many foreign countries are unwilling to prosecute   violators, even when they are large companies or governments.  ``Frankly developing countries are finding this a difficult   task, especially in the enforcement area,'' Eizenstat said.  He said piracy rates were intolerably high in the Middle East   and singled out Kuwait as the only WTO member without formal  copyright legislation.  But he said rates also were excessive in many developed   countries.  ``Despite our and the industry's efforts, the rate of piracy of   business software applications in Spain has hovered near 60 percent  for two years,'' he said.\n",

When we enter a market, it is key that there should be a copyright law, said Michel Lacombe, president for Microsoft's European, Middle East and African Affairs. But that is only the first step. The next step is to implement and enforce the law, he aded. Under the strong pressure from international software companies, especially Microsoft, Lebanese parliament last month approved the copyright law on condition that those firms provide their products on a discount of up to 90 percent to students, who can not afford the costly original ones. Lebanon is one of the high-piracy countries, with nine out of 10 programs being illegally used. Many software manufacturers complained that they lost millions of U.S. dollars each year on Lebanese market due to the rampant piracy. Lacombe said he hoped to see the piracy rate drop to some 60 percent in the next few years. We will be concentrating on Lebanese government agencies and large corporations first. That is as easy as picking fruit from the tree, he said. Meanwhile, he called on the Lebanese government to play its role in enforcing the law. It's been our experience in emerging markets that enforcing a piracy law helps the development of a local informatioln technology market, We will be here to help the growth of this industry, Lacombe said. After Lebanese parliament approved the law, Microsoft decided to open its regional office in Beirut to deal with its businesses for Syria, Jordan and Cyprus.\n",

The Thai side said that the trawler was in Thai territorial waters and that the Cambodian soldiers would face charges of illegal entry, illegal possession and use of weapons, piracy, resisting arrest and illegal use of radio communication. However, the soldiers claimed that the Thai trawler was fishing in Cambodian waters. Governor Pramkesorn also accused the trawler of illegally fishing in Cambodian waters.

Data provided by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) Regional Seminar and Workshop on Piracy and Armed Robbery Against Ships shows the number of piracy cases in the region dropped to 110 in 1997 from 141 in 1996 and further contracted to 95 in 1998. It also shows that there has not been a single pirate attack in Singapore's water since 1991 thanks to its Coast Guard's vigilance. Seminar participants attributed the positive development to the joint efforts of countries in the region and took it as an inspiring result of the cooperative measures taken by concerned countries in the region to keep ship lane safe. The seminar and workshop, attended by some 70 participants and observers from 19 maritime administrations, is part of the on-going efforts by the IMO to improve safety at sea and in port areas through assisting government officials in the countries concerned to enhance their capability for preventing and suppressing piracy and armed robbery against ships in their coastal waters and ports through measures such as the implementation of IMO guidelines. The seminar and workshop will cover topics such as international law, IMO guidelines on prevention and suppression of piracy and robbery and reports by concerned countries on incidents in their waters and measures taken to address the problem.

His office will cooperate with governmental and non-governmental copyright protection offices in other countries. Many analysts say that piracy is a global problem. A report from the International Intellectual Property Alliance shows that the U.S. copyright industry suffered an estimated 10.8 billion U.S. dollars in losses because of piracy in 55 countries. The International Publishing Association regards reproducing of copyrighted works of others without the authorization of the owner of copyright, without making remuneration and in most cases, without indicating the sources, piracy. This mainly involves the reproduction and distribution of books, periodicals, CDs, VCDs, multimedia products, motion pictures and computer software. In the last five years, Chinese copyright authorities have campaigned against piracy frequently, seizing millions of pirated products and putting smugglers in prison, Shen says. The revised Criminal Law states that these offenders may be sentenced to three to seven years in prison. People who help to seize illegal disk production lines can be paid up to 350,000 yuan (42,000 U.S. dollars) in reward money.. Copyright pirates are a destructive force that disrupts the market economy and damages civilization, he says, but these offenders are becoming bolder and more sophisticated in reproducing and distributing pirated products. The governments of various countries need a cooperative attitude and need to come together to crack down on illegal activities to strengthen the international protection of intellectual property, he concludes.\n",

The effort, which was applauded by industry executives Wednesday, has two main elements. First, the White House will issue an executive order that directs all federal agencies to insure that the government and its contractors do not buy or use pirated software. And the White House is also directing the U.S. trade representative, Charlene Barshevsky, to press foreign governments to embark on similar programs.    ``By making sure its own house is in order, this puts the United States government in a stronger position to make the anti-piracy message overseas,'' said Brad Smith, general counsel for international affairs at Microsoft Corp., the largest software company.    The nation's software industry is thriving, having grown at seven times the rate of the economy overall during the 1990s. But software piracy is a growing concern for the industry, especially as foreign nations close the gap with the United States in computer use.    An estimated 27 percent of the software used in the United States has been illegally copied, violating copyright laws, estimates the Business Software Alliance, a trade group. In countries like China and Russia, however, the piracy rates are estimated at more than 90 percent. Even in nations like Taiwan and Spain, the piracy rates are roughly 60 percent.    The government announcement will show that the software industry is raising its voice in Washington and it is being heard.    ``This is a big deal from our perspective and having the White House weigh in certainly strengthens the message the industry has been making for some time,'' said Eric Schmidt, chairman of Novell Inc., a networking software company in San Jose.\n",

The risk to business is enormous, over and above the fact that users of pirated software are breaking international and local laws, piracy manager Frederick Jonker said. He said pirated software did not have the support of manufacturers which meant any problems that may occur would not be resolved by Microsoft certified solution providers. The American firm is undertaking a two-pronged campaign to eradicate piracy: a strong crackdown on offenders and an awareness campaign aimed at getting organisations to legitimize their software. The aim is to dramatically reduce piracy rates in Zimbabwe which are more than double those in the developed world. Complimentary to the Microsoft campaign, the Business Software Alliance will be conducting audits on companies that have not legitimize their software and will also be stipulating a cut-off date by which they should have legalized their operations.

This foundation is the very incentive for developing software and it provides a market-driven reward for successful products, Holleyman said. The BSA represents the world's leading software developers and educates computer users on software piracy in more than 60 countries. Holleyman announced that the BSA and the Philippine Software Association will join hands to promote the growth of the Philippine software industry and to work together in tackling intellectual piracy issues of common interest. In his speech, Holleyman also emphasized the importance of ratifying and implementing the new World Intellectual Property Organization Copyright Treaty adopted by the international community in December 1996.\n",

Macao Governor Vasco Rocha Vieira has signed a new decree, which will be published in the government gazette next week, to restrict the flow of machines and products that are liable for making piracy from May 1. The import and export of more than 20 items, which include printing machines, video-taking equipment and other machines that can be used to make pirated products must first obtain approval and license. The restriction also covers such digital products as CD-ROM's, LD's, VCD's and DVD's, according to the decree. A press release issued Wednesday night from the Government Information Office said the authorities hope these measures will prevent piracy of computer programs, games and digital audio and video products and other illegal business activities. It is necessary to put the import and export of audio and video recorders and other products that can be used for piracy under control so as to implement Macao's due duty as a member of the World Trade Organization in the protection of intellectual property rights, the governor said in the decree. The authorities has raided suspected factories a dozen times since the beginning of 1997, and found some 20,000 pieces of pirated audio, video and computer program discs.\n",

      "raw text: 1998-01-07   Campaign Launched in HK Against Software Piracy  The Business Software Alliance (BSA) launched here Wednesday its new year campaign against corporate software piracy in small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs). A survey commissioned by the BSA last year found that many SMBs in Hong Kong were taking serious risks by using illegal software, said Tom Robertson, vice president of the alliance which groups leading software producers such as Lotus, Microsoft and Novell. Their piracy has led to huge losses to the software industry in Hong Kong, Robertson claimed. The campaign grants the firms 45 days to legalize their software use or face legal action. In 1997, the BSA had taken high-profile actions against illegal software use in large companies. A total of 18 cases have so far been settled with 5.8 million HK dollars (740,000 U.S. dollars) recovered. According to Kevin Henshaw, the BSA's Hong Kong chairman, the alliance will also continue its efforts in educating the business community on responsible software use. The first seminar will be held in March for the purpose. He encouraged local business organizations to join the BSA in eradicating software piracy in Hong Kong. Commenting on an increased number of raids carried out in the past several months by the Special Administrative Region authorities against software piracy, Henshaw said, Their action should be commended. A new Copyright Ordinance, which came into force in June 1997, contains several new provisions strengthening the Customs and Excise Department's ability to fight corporate end-user and retail software piracy. Formed in 1988, the BSA represents the software industry in its efforts to eradicate the illegal copying, sale and distribution of computer software around the world. It achieves this through educational initiatives and legal proceedings.\n",

While announcing the lawsuit, Microsoft cited statistics showing that pirated software accounts for close to 30 percent of all software sold in California. On Thursday, Microsoft also filed similar lawsuits against five computer resellers in Illinois for allegedly distributing counterfeit Microsoft software and installing unlicensed software on computers. Microsoft said the lawsuits are part of its ongoing efforts to hinder the negative effects of software piracy, which, it said, has significant impact on the commercial businesses of software distributors and the economies they work to support.

The state also lost more than 5,400 jobs due to piracy.

      "raw text: 1998-12-07   Progress Made in Combating Computer Software Piracy  Robert Holleyman, the president and CEO of the U.S.'s Business Software Alliance, says that China has made progress in combating computer software piracy in the past six years. He says they are confident that with joint Chinese government, software company, industrial, media, educational institution, and general public efforts, piracy can be significantly curbed. BSA released its Contributions of the Software Industry to the Chinese Economy, here today, which says that in 1997, China's software market was worth 1.4 billion U.S. dollars. The software industry provided more than 60,000 jobs and added more than 200 million U.S. dollars in tax revenues. It says that China's software industry will grow at an annual rate of 28 percent over the next 5 years and will be worth 3.6 billion U.S. dollars in 2001. That year, the industry will provide more than 100,000 jobs and add more than 500 million U.S. dollars to government tax revenues. The report was based on a study of 100 companies active in China's software industry, 74 percent of which are headquartered in China. It was done by PricewaterhouseCoopers with the assistance of China's Research Center of Computer and Microelectronics Industrial Development-Marketing Information Center. Over 60 percent of the companies surveyed said that piracy has had a measurable effect on their sales. Most Chinese software companies know that piracy seriously prevents further growth and development of the software industry, reduces the overall competitiveness of the local software industry, and places it in an adverse position in the international market. The fact that the study was done in China, as well as the positive response to the findings, indicates a new level of cooperation between the world's software companies and China in dealing with the piracy issue, Holleyman says. BSA was founded in Washington D.C. in 1988, and includes the world's leading software manufacturers like Microsoft, Lotus, IBM, Compaq and Intel. It has a representative office in Beijing and links with many organizations in China.\n",

Officers arrested two men, aged between 28 and 31, including the mastermind of the syndicate, and seized a computer server, a desktop and other related equipment. The suspected pirates in this case make use of the computer server to save the pirated software onto the homepage of the internet for the public to download the software free of charge. In return, they could make money by attracting advertisements. To tackle the online piracy problem, the department has sent members of the Anti-internet Piracy Team to the Cyber smuggling Center in Virginia, United states to undergo a week-long training on ways to curb internet piracy activities. Locally, the Department, with the assistance of the U.S. Customs Service, has just run a four-day Cyber Investigation Seminar. Internet piracy is a new challenge to the Hong Kong Customs, the Assistant Commissioner of Customs and Excise (Control and Intellectual Property) Vincent Poon Yeung-kwong Thursday addressed the closing ceremony of the Seminar. Cyber investigation is a deep and enormous subject, he noted. He pointed out that the seminar, concluded today, was to lay a foundation for the participants to further their study into cyber investigation and computer forensics in future. Taking on the success of this seminar, we look forward to arranging similar training in the future with the US Customs Service and other enforcement agencies with a view to fully equipping our officers for the new challenges ahead, Poon said. Also speaking at the event, James Dozier, a senior customs representative of the American Consulate General, paid tribute to the Hong Kong Customs for its support, cooperation and coordination to make the seminar possible. Dozier noted that cyber smuggling was the wave of the present and future regarding criminal activity. He said in order to combat that global issue, it was imperative to have international cooperation between law enforcement agencies in this arena. At the closing ceremony, 58 course members were presented a graduation certificate in recognition of their achievements made when attending the seminar. Last year, Customs officers seized 16.5 million pirated optical discs, worth $290 million, and arrested 2,701 people.

The Daily Nation newspaper Thursday quoted David Muita, chairman of the association, as warning that Kenya's publishing industry would face a collapse if the menace was not curbed. Muita said that the industry had a yearly turnover of two billion shillings (27 million dollars) and served a source of livelihood for more than 3,000 families. He urged publishers to inform the association about cases of piracy to facilitate the crackdown against the culprits. We will in future blacklist all booksellers involved in piracy  activities to ensure they get no orders from us,  he said. Muita revealed that the association would press for tougher laws relating to the Copyrights Act, saying that the 200,000-shilling (2,700 dollars) fine or the five-year jail term was too lenient for a criminal making millions of shillings illegally.\n",

      "raw text: 1999-03-12   China Introduces Anti-Piracy Technology  The China Software Association ( CSA) today introduced new anti-piracy technology to Chinese software producers, a move to add to the government efforts to protection intellectual property right. The new technology -- DiscGuard -- was developed by the US- based TTR Company. DiscGuard, which reportedly offers one of most effective means to prevent pirating of CD-ROM (read only memory) software, cannot be decoded, according to one CSA official. CD-ROM is widely used by software producers worldwide and is highly vulnerable to pirating. DiscGuard technology involves inserting unique fingerprints to CD-ROM in order to effectively prevent illegal duplication and applications of CD-ROM software. China's software industry has registered a 30 percent annual growth rate for a straight ten years. The software market is expected to hit 100 billion yuan (12.3 billion U.S. dollars) by 2010, when the sector will emerge as one of the nation's pillar industries. The Copyright Administration Bureau introduced a plan to establish a nationwide anti-piracy system in January last year. Bureau officials note that introducing advanced anti-piracy and copyright authentication technology from abroad will substantially strengthen the national campaign to prevent CD pirating. Representatives from China's major software producers, including Legend, Founder and Tongfang, attended a press conference held to introduce the new anti-piracy technology.\n",

Between January and November in 1998, Macao police discovered at least 12 major cases of CD piracy, confiscating some 1.748 million pieces of pirated CDs. The figure was 13 times the sum seized in 1997. On November 27, Macao police detected about 450,000 pieces of pirated audio and video CDs in four trucks which were loaded with paper cartons. It was the largest case of CD piracy uncovered by local police in recent years. Signs have shown that some illegal gangs have been turning out pirated CD products in Macao and then put them on sale in Hong Kong and the inland areas of China, police sources said. Local police vowed to step up checking of suspicious vehicles and vessels in the port areas of Macao.\n",

      "raw text: Officials call for tougher laws to combat copyright piracy  Officials said Monday they may have to make buying pirated compact discs illegal as part of Hong Kong's war against copyright piracy.    Speaking at a three-day international conference, Secretary for Trade and Industry Brian Chau, said if the government does not see a fall in demand for pirated goods, officials may have to review whether consumers can continue to buy them without fear of prosecution.    Chau said the government would ensure that ``all relevant issues are taken into account.''    The Hong Kong official added that regional law enforcement agencies have to cooperate to fight piracy on the Internet. He said Hong Kong has some of the best laws protecting copyright on the Internet.    Authorities in Hong Kong and other territories in the region are under pressure, particularly from the United States, to do a better job of protecting intellectual property. U.S. officials say Hong Kong has become a production center as well as a distribution center since officials in mainland China began cracking down.    U.S. officials last month decided to keep Hong Kong on a watchlist for copyright violation.    Hong Kong last year passed what officials said is one of the toughest anti-pirating laws in the world. Customs officials also have staged several high-profile raids.    In April, officers of Hong Kong's anti-corruption agency seized 7 million pirated video CDs and production equipment worth 650 million Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 83 million) in the biggest such seizure in Hong Kong's history.    Despite the government's efforts to crack down on piracy, no less than 100 shops across the territory still openly sell pirated video or music CDs and computer software in shopping malls or on the street.    These shops sell recently released movies or music discs for about 35 Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 4.50) each. Popular software, including the soon-to-be-released Windows 98, are sold for a fraction of the price of a legitimate copy.    Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa, speaking at the same conference, said the government is committed to cracking down on piracy, but Hong Kong ``is a telecommunications center and a leading center for film and television production. The demand for cheap pirated optical discs is considerable and this provides the incentive for piracy or counterfeiting.''\n",

      "raw text: &HT;    The growing ease with which consumers can pirate movies and music through the Internet is ``the most devastating thing that's happened to the entertainment business in, I think, the last 75 years,'' Michael Eisner, chairman of the Walt Disney Co., told Congress on Wednesday.    If such piracy continues to grow, musicians, writers, movie directors and many others will lose their jobs as industry profits wither, he predicted. When that day comes, ``you have ended, in effect, the American intellectual strength that we have had,'' he said.    Eisner made a pitch for stronger legal protection of intellectual property on the second day of the ``High-Tech Summit'' organized by the congressional Joint Economic Committee. Intellectual property includes the movies, music, books, software and other copyrighted materials that can be passed around the Internet.    ``With the click of a mouse, pirated copies of intellectual property can be transmitted around the world,'' Eisner said. ``The artists who compose and perform music have already been victimized.''    As Internet technology improves, ``it will be possible to transmit perfect copies (of movies) without our knowledge, participation or consent,'' he said.    This growing piracy could lead to the financial collapse of the entertainment industry, which would have a broad economic impact, Eisner said. ``American copyright industries lead all major industry sectors in foreign sales and exports,'' he said.    Eisner urged Congress to ``explore with us'' the possibility of requiring computer manufacturers and Internet service providers to install technologies that could look for digital ``watermarks'' on copyrighted materials. If a consumer tried to download a bootlegged movie without such a mark, the operation would fail.    Eisner also asked Congress to ``work with governments around the world to respect our rights.'' He said he wants the federal government to help educate consumers about piracy, saying many people don't realize the harm they are doing when they download stolen materials.    Eisner wasn't alone in his pleadings Wednesday, At a news conference, the Business Software Alliance called upon the presumptive presidential candidates, Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, to take strong anti-piracy positions.    The coalition of top software executives predicted that in the next five years, two-thirds of all software will be distributed over the Internet, and this ``makes it more important than ever to ensure strong copyright protection for computer software.'' The executives pointed to a new study by the International Planning and Research Corp., which estimated that global software piracy rate was 36 percent in 1999. But in some countries, the piracy rate was more than 90 percent.    Industry executives at the new conference conceded that software makers could revise their products to better protect them from piracy.    ``From a technical standpoint, it's quite true that we could do that,'' said Carol Bartz, chairman and chief executive of Autodesk Inc. ``But I'm not at all sure you would like the results.

      "raw text: 1998-11-25   China's Fight against Software Piracy (2)  But legitimate software companies can't sustain development if they fail to sell a lot in the first 3 months after a new product is released. Zou says that piracy has driven many Chinese software companies into financial difficulties and that these companies are weaker than their overseas counterparts and have limited overseas sales, so losing the China market means no growth for them. In order to protect the national software industry and fair competition, the Chinese Government and software industry have adopted strict measures to fight piracy. The National Copyright Administration is expected to have some progress in cracking down on piracy this year, after seizing 36,236 pieces of pirated software last year. This year, customs officers in Guangdong and other provinces seized several hundred million pirated compact disks, and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region closed several underground factories. The State Council has decided to hold training programs to teach government employees about protecting intellectual property rights in the next three years. China has given prison sentences of as much as 13 years to copyright violators. The highest compensation that a Chinese court has awarded in a software copyright violation suit amounted to 12 million U.S. dollars. National Copyright Administration sources say that the most urgent thing now is to compose an inventory of the country's software producers to serve as a basis for industry regulations. Last year, the software industry created more than 37,000 jobs in China and it is estimated that for every 10 percentage points in piracy decreases, China will add software sales worth 480 million U.S. dollars and other economic activities worth 820 million U.S. dollars, and 13,000 jobs. The government will also add 77 million U.S. dollars worth of tax revenues a year.\n",

Yvonne Choi, acting secretary for trade and industry, told Legislative Council members that in the 12 months ending March this year, C&AMP;ED and the Police have carried out four joint raids against shops involved in the sale of pirated discs, arresting 54 persons and seizing over 350,000 copies of pirated optical discs and other articles worth over 7.3 million HK dollars (935,897 U.S. dollars) in total.

Peter estimated that annual sales of pirated video compact discs and music compact discs in Malaysia amounted to 300 million (dlrs 71.4 million), nearly half the amount taken in by legitimate copies.    He said the music and motion picture industries had lost about 100 million ringgit (dlrs 25 million) as a result of pirates, who sell their wares openly in marketplaces around the capital, Kuala Lumpur.    Earlier this week, several intellectual property protection groups urged the government to clamp down on manufacturers of illegal VCDs and CDs.    The Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry, however, said it did not have jurisdiction to seize machines used by makers of the pirated CDs, VCDs and CD-ROMs.    According to a recent survey of Southeast Asia's software industry, an estimated 84 percent of the software in the region was illegal.\n",

Although Ukraine has signed a series of international conventions on the protection of intellectual property rights, it still lacks effective management and supervision in this field, said Deputy Prime Minister Ykola Zhulynsky here Monday. Piracy of audio-video products and computer software is rampant in his country, Zhulynsky said at the first meeting of the Intellectual Property Rights Protection Committee, which was established in mid-February. Ukraine has joined international pacts such as The Bern Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works,  The Universal Copyright Convention and The Convention for the Protection of Producers of Phonograms against Unauthorized Duplication of their Phonograms, according to the deputy prime minister. Some foreign companies and individuals have taken legal actions against the violation of their intellectual property rights by Ukrainian enterprises. The illegal practice has triggered off discontent from Ukraine's trading partners and damaged the country's image, he noted.

The software piracy rates rose last year in the country's 21 states, including California and Virginia, where much of the recent growth in the technology sector has been fueled. Although we have made some gains in protecting intellectual property and reducing the impact of software piracy worldwide, Microsoft said in a statement, criminal counterfeiting and the Internet has posed distinct challenges for Microsoft and the rest of the software industry in battling this issue. According to the study, losses for the 10 most affected states including California, Texas and New York amounted to some 3.5 billion U.S. dollars, or 57 percent of the nation's total. In 1998, communities nationwide lost over 1 billion dollars in tax revenues, about 40 million dollars above the 1997 level. The study said that 29 states had piracy rates higher than the national average of 25 percent. And eight states among them had rates over 40 percent. Microsoft said that last year it filed actions against 168 resellers for distributing counterfeit software and hard disk loading -- the practice of installing pirated software in computers sold to consumers. The company did not say how much it suffered in terms of money, but confirmed that more than 43 million units of counterfeit Microsoft software were seized in the country last year. Consumers using counterfeit software could find they are missing key elements including computer code, have higher risk of viruses, and are ineligible for technical support or upgrade, the company said. By pirating software or spending money on counterfeit products, Microsoft added, consumers also are inadvertently contributing to causing losses in the form of tax revenue and employment in an industry that has recently been responsible for much of the growth of the U.S. economy.\n",

S. naval forces in the Persian Gulf of practising piracy against a cargo ship carrying rice imported by Iraq under the oil-for-food program with U.N.. A spokesman for the Iraqi trade ministry told the Iraqi News Agency that on December 19, the U.S. naval forces intercepted and detained a cargo ship carrying 14, 538 tons of imported rice from Vietnam, and heading for southern Iraq's Umm Qasr port. The spokesman said that the cargo ship has not been released yet. He slammed the U.S. piracy practice as unjustifiable, inhuman and immoral, saying it was not the first time that the U. S. navy in the Gulf did so. The U.N. imposed sanctions on Iraq nine years ago shortly after it invaded Kuwait, but it adopted a oil-for-food deal on Iraq in 1996, which allows Iraq to export limited amount of oil every six months to buy food, medicine and other humanitarian goods. This piracy practice reflects the hostile U.S. policy toward the Iraqi people suffering under the U.N. embargo, the spokesman said, adding the U.S. aims to prolong the embargo and the suffering of the Iraqi people. The spokesman also rapped the U.S. envoy at the U.N. Sanctions Committee of deliberately blocking the approval of Iraqi contracts signed under the oil-for-food program. The oil-for-food deal has entered its seventh phase as of December 12.\n",

      "raw text: 1999-04-29 10:45:08   financial   Microsoft Sues 15 Florida Companies  Microsoft Corp. is suing 15 Florida companies, alleging that they sold counterfeit versions of Windows  95, Windows 98, and other company software.  Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft is the world's dominant maker of   personal computer software. Its Windows operating system runs the  basic functions of 90 percent of the world's personal computers.  The lawsuits filed in federal courts seek unspecified damages   and a judge's order to stop distribution of the software, corporate  attorney Nick Psyhogeos said Wednesday.  They come at a time when technology crimes are on the rise   throughout Florida, according to police quoted in a company  release.  ``We're finding a substantial increase of technology-related   crime in the state,'' said Phil Ramer, director of the Florida  Department of Law Enforcement's Office of Statewide Intelligence.  ``Organized crime rings have begun to include software piracy in  their roster of other illegal activities because of the large sums  of money that they stand to make.''  Businesses, consumers and the government are the ones who   suffer, company executives said.  Software piracy cost Florida 7,186 jobs in 1997 and $490 million   in lost wages, tax revenue and retail sales, said Psyhogeos, citing  a Microsoft-commissioned study from International Planning &AMP;  Research Corp., a market research company.  And counterfeit software, which often has viruses and bugs, does   not come with technical support or warranty protection. Consumers  also aren't eligible for software upgrades.  The lawsuits filed Friday were against companies in Tampa,   Orlando, Miami and eight other cities in central and South Florida,  one of the company's largest anti-piracy initiatives in a single  state, executives said.  Under federal law, the companies could be liable for as much as   $100,000 for each instance of copyright infringement, said Pam  Salzer, a spokeswoman for the company's east region.  Microsoft isn't able to estimate how much software piracy costs   the company, but Salzer estimated it's a $2 billion-a-year problem  for the industry.  Its impact is felt even in Latin America, according to Tony   Viera, a Microsoft attorney in charge of anti-piracy for that  region.  Two leads for the Florida lawsuits came from Chile and Peru,   Viera said, adding that much illegal software goes overseas from  Miami, Texas and California.  Two companies in Florida also are being investigated by police.   Felix and Marta Smud, who were arrested in Tampa and had their   home searched Monday, were selling counterfeit Microsoft software  for $65 apiece from their home-based company, said detective Bill  Todd.  The pair were charged with conspiracy and distribution of   illegal software, allegedly shipped the counterfeit products  nationwide.  The Florida Department of Law Enforcement also searched Proline   Technologies of Clearwater on Tuesday and seized 100 disks, police  said.  Microsoft has filed more than 100 lawsuits within the last year   in cities across the nation, including New York, New Jersey,  Pennsylvania, Ohio, Virginia, Maryland, California, Chicago,  Minnesota and Alabama.   *------ EDITOR'S NOTE: Customers with questions about the legitimacy of   Microsoft products can call the company's anti-piracy hot line:  (800) RU-LEGIT or (800) 785-3448.

      "raw text: HONG KONG MOVIE THEATERS GO DARK TO PROTEST   PIRACY OF FILMS  The stars were on glittering display in Hong Kong Wednesday, though not on the silver screen.    Movie theaters across the territory went dark for the day to protest the flood of illegally copied films. An array of local film and pop celebrities led a rally of 2,000 people to demand a tougher crackdown on piracy.    Film producers say the Hong Kong film industry, once one of the largest exporters of movies after Hollywood, has been devastated by the explosive growth of movies illegally recorded onto compact disks.    ``It's a downward spiral,'' said Woody Tsung, the chief executive of the Motion Picture Industry Association. ``The only way we can come out of this crisis is if the government gets rid of piracy.''    For all the doomsday talk, the protest Wednesday was a bubbly affair. Jackie Chan, perhaps Hong Kong's biggest star, showed up in a black-suede jacket and matching pants to serve as the unofficial marshal. As crowds squealed and cameras flashed, it was hard to tell the politics and the pop culture apart.    Hong Kong was taken off a watch list by the U.S. government last month after it stepped up efforts to raid factories that produce illegally copied material. But executives here say the former British colony remains one of the worst offenders in Asia for copyright violations.    The protest rally also included representatives of the music, cable-television and computer-software industries _ all of whom called on the Hong Kong government to assign police officers to close factories that make illegal software and to arrest the merchants who peddle it.    Hong Kong's movie industry, in particular, has been damaged by the advent of video compact disks, which can be bought for $2 in stores or at street stalls, often days before the films are released in theaters.    Tsung said the industry did not have reliable figures for how much money it loses each year as a result of illegally copied movies. But he said the box office revenue of Hong Kong films declined from $168 million in 1993 to $54 million last year, and he attributed 95 percent of the decline to piracy.    Theater owners said they lost about $250,000 by shutting down cinemas Wednesday. They, too, contend that they are in a battle for survival. Five years ago, Hong Kong had 180 cinemas. Today, with so many people buying bootleg disks instead of tickets to the local multiplex, the number has fallen to 73.    ``It's incredible,'' said Rigo Jesu, an executive at the Intercontinental Group, which distributes films and operates cinemas here. ``I don't know of a situation like this anywhere else in the world.''    In the deserted lobby of Queen's Theater in central Hong Kong, a sign on the box office window apologized for being closed. It added: ``Imagine a city without cinemas. If piracy is allowed to continue, this will be the result.''    In a signal that the government regards piracy as a grave issue, Hong Kong's chief executive, Tung Chee-hwa, emerged from his office to accept a petition from the protesters. In a statement, he said: ``We will not allow piracy or counterfeiting activities to tarnish Hong Kong's reputation.''    On Tuesday, Customs officials conducted raids throughout the territory and said they seized 350,000 pirated optical disks, worth an estimated $683,000, and arrested 37 suspects. In all of 1998, Hong Kong seized 39 million pirated disks and arrested 1,645 people.    But industry executives said Hong Kong must assign the police to crack down on the merchants who sell pirated software, since they are too widely dispersed for the 220 Customs officials to handle.    The problem extends beyond movies. More than half the sales of some recordings in Hong Kong are generated by illegal copies, according to Frank Brown, the president of MTV Networks Asia. ``Hong Kong is amongst the worst in the region, though not as bad as India and China,'' Brown said.    Some executives have faulted the United States for lifting the pressure on\n",

      "raw text: 1999-09-18   Piracy under Control in HK: Customs Commissioner  Piracy in Hong Kong is now under control as the sale of pirated compact discs in many notorious shopping arcades has been shrinking sharply. John Tsang Chun-wah, commissioner of customs and excise, made this remarks at his Letter from Hong Kong broadcast on Radio Television Hong Kong Saturday morning. The customs had allocated a great deal of resources to this area of work, he said, adding that the department had the largest dedicated professional enforcement team in the world to tackle the piracy problem. This reflects our strong commitment and determination to wipe out the illicit business, Tsang stressed. Regarding the fight against the retail sale of pirated goods, a 185-member Special Task Force was set up in late June this year to combat the sale of pirated compact discs at street level. In addition, we have also maintained a close liaison with the police. Intelligence is exchanged regularly and joint operations against notorious shopping centers and shops on the streets are mounted periodically, he noted. To tackle the problem, he said the customs had redirected the enforcement strategy of the Intellectual Property Investigation Bureau aiming at high-level piracy activities so as to track down the source of pirated compact discs by taking proactive actions at the manufacturing, storage and import or export levels. Tsang said the move had been enhancing the effectiveness of their enforcement actions. He also disclosed that intelligence suggested that after the recent series of vigorous enforcement actions, many copyright pirates had moved their illicit business to neighboring territories. In order to further strengthen the scope of Customs' enforcement, he went on, the government was considering the introduction of other new legislation. Tsang said like many other advanced places in the world, piracy in Hong Kong had become a social problem, which could not be solved merely by legislative and enforcement means. Tough customs is only a law enforcement agency, we have recently been working with other government departments and the industry to heighten public awareness of the need to protect intellectual property rights, he added.\n",

      "raw text: 1997-12-21   Companies Installed More Software Piracy  A growing number of new business computer softwares used worldwide have been installed illegally, according to the U.S. Software Publishers Association. From sharing floppies to using boot-legged CDs, piracy will cost software makers 14.5 billion U.S. dollars in lost sales this year, estimates the Business Software Alliance, another U.S. organization engaged in the research. Many software pirates don't even know they're pirates. Earlier this month, New York architectural firm MKDA paid 150,000 U.S. dollars to settle copyright infringement charges brought by the Business Software Alliance. In October, Fort Worth, Texas-based Marketing Management Inc. paid 400,000 U.S. dollars to settle similar charges. Piracies occur mostly in smaller companies, which unknowingly buy pirated items from resellers, according to researchers. One problem is that softlifting isn't widely seen as a crime. But penalties can be stiff. Fines can reach 100,000 U.S. dollars per illegal copy, while commercial piracy is punishable by five years in prison and 250,000 U.S. dollars in fines. Experts suggest several ways for small companies to stay legal, which include checking their sources, registering the software with the manufacturer, and organizing software management well.\n",

The rapid response squads, which are managed by the Swiss-based Marine Risk Management Group, can move into action anywhere in the region within 24 hours, the East African weekly newspaper reported Monday. They are part of a comprehensive counter-piracy program known as Maritime Asset Recovery and Protection recently launched in London, according to the report. The Somali coastline has become increasingly dangerous, with frequent pirate attacks by people believed to be members of the warring military factions controlling different parts of the country. Kenya and Tanzania have also reported isolated cases of pirate attacks on ships in their territorial waters. A Mombasa-based shipping agent welcomed the move, saying it was the best way to counter the Somali gangs. He said his principals had spent a lot of money securing safe passage for their ships and crew between Somali ports. Early this year, Tanzania Harbors Authority said it had stepped up surveillance in its coastal waters to curb piracy. Kenya Ports Authority also announced it was boosting police patrol within its waters after several anchored cargo ships were attacked.\n",

China recently mapped out a regulation to strengthen its control over the cultural market, and authorities nationwide have made great progress in their efforts to eliminate piracy of video and audio materials and the spread of pornography, according to China Cultural News. In a circular, the Ministry of Culture asked all video rental shops in the country to allow themselves to be inspected for signs of pirated or pornographic videotapes. Inspections also will be conducted in Liaoning Province in the north, the coastal Shandong Province, and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in the southwest to ensure shops sell legal products. China has been successful in a new round of national campaign against piracy and pornography, which started early this month. South China's Guangdong Province recently confiscated 48,000 pornographic audio and video products and pirated CDs after a series of inspections across the province. At the same time, the customs office in the province has seized 134,000 illegal publications since November. Guangdong has performed 457 market inspections, and confiscated 1.3 million packs or pieces of illegal video and electronic publications from last September through March of this year.\n",

In a letter to Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Hong Kong Film Awards Association Ng See-Yuen, Tung called for the copyright owners' support and cooperation which is conducive to the successful prosecution of copyright pirates. Tung called on the industry to join hands in reporting copyright piracy and give strong support to the Reward Scheme of the Customs and Excise Department so as to facilitate the execution of law and the gathering of intelligence. The government is committed to enhancing respect for intellectual property rights among various sectors and to strictly enforcing the relevant regulations, Tung said. The chief executive said Hong Kong's laws concerning intellectual property rights are regarded as among the world's highest standard and the HKSAR government has implemented a series of measures in a bid to strengthen actions against copyright piracy. According to Tung, Hong Kong customs seized more than 4.5 million copies of pirated optical discs valued at more than 140 million HK dollars (17.9 million U.S. dollars) in 1997. In the first quarter of 1998, he added, Hong Kong customs again stepped up their efforts in raiding the more notorious retail outlets and seized more than 2.5 million pirated optical discs.

A report from the Seattle-based computer-software giant also said two more Florida companies are under investigation. Microsoft said the move in Florida was part of its national anti-piracy effort, but that there is more illegal copying of software in Florida than in most other states. The piracy rate in the U.S. as a whole is about 27 percent. And in Florida it is estimated to be 32.3 percent, said Tony Viera, Microsoft corporate attorney in charge of anti-piracy for Latin America and Florida. Last month, Microsoft filed similar suits against 20 Californian companies that had sold or installed illegal copies of Microsoft programs. Over the last two years, Microsoft has filed more than 100 similar civil lawsuits in dozens of states, including New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Virginia, Maryland, Illinois, Minnesota, Alabama and New York. Microsoft claims that software piracy cost Florida 7,186 jobs in 1997 and 490 million U.S. dollars in lost wages, tax revenue and retail sales. Software pirates often sell programs for 50 percent of the average retail value, and some for as low as 10 percent. Industry sources say while Microsoft itself has expanded efforts to sell legitimate copies of its software over the Internet, the network also makes distribution of illegal versions easier to do and harder to detect.\n",

      "raw text: 1999-06-10 14:00:28   financial   Record Industry Fights Pirates  The recording industry's attack on music piracy bit a chunk out of the booming illegal trade last year, but  stronger laws and more aggressive prosecution are still needed to  make any serious impact, industry enforcers said Thursday.  ``Fighting music piracy today means fighting a huge, organized,   illegal international business,'' said Jason Berman, head of the  International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, which  represents 1,300 record companies in 70 countries.  ``Our industry dedicates large resources to that fight but we   need, above all else, support of the governments,'' Berman said.  Once the bailiwick of backroom bootleggers with a few cassette   copying machines, music piracy has grown into a $4.5 billion  industry with sophisticated global distribution networks and close  ties to organized crime.  In response, the federation formed its international anti-piracy   team in 1997, recruiting investigators and industry experts to  sniff out the operations that produce an estimated 2 billion  counterfeit CDs and cassettes every year.  In 1998, the unit seized more than 60 million illegally produced   CDs -- half of them from Southeast Asia and Latin America -- and  closed down major manufacturing plants in North America, Europe,  the Middle East and Asia, the federation said.  Iain Grant, the organization's head of enforcement, said the   Mafia sometimes uses lucrative bootleg CD operations to finance  drug-trafficking and other criminal endeavors.  ``You do not need to be a rocket scientist to expect that   organized crime groups worldwide will get involved when there are  profits which can be generated at this level,'' Grant said.  In April, the federation assisted in the raid of a CD   manufacturing plant in Naples, Italy, that resulted in the arrest  of 14 reputed Mafia members and led investigators to various other  criminal operations, Grant said. The plant was generating $100,000  a week, he said.  Pirated recordings, most often sold at outdoor markets and by   smaller independent shops that run little risk of getting caught,  tend to be identifiable by shoddily copied liner art, Berman said.  But the sound quality can be as good as the real thing, he   acknowledged.  Berman said the organization is hampered by inadequate laws and   relatively light penalties for music piracy.  ``No amount of investigative work on our part, no amount of   money, resources, time and effort will succeed in reducing these  incredible levels of piracy if governments don't take effective  enforcement actions that include both substantial fines and prison  sentences,'' he said.  The industry has had a harder time stemming illegal music   copying via the Internet.  Currently, its only recourse is trying to shut down Internet   sites with cease-and-desist orders, which it has done in thousands  of cases. But there are an estimated 400,000 infringing sites left  and more coming online every day, the federation said.  This battle has resulted in the formation of the Secured Digital   Music Initiative, which seeks to develop a copyright directive that  will set ground rules for Internet music commerce, Berman said.\n",

We note that the USTR has given due recognition to Hong Kong's determination and effort to solve the piracy problem, the spokesman said. However, it is not justified to include Hong Kong on the 'Watch List,' in view of the considerable and persistent anti-piracy efforts and initiatives the Government has made. We are disappointed at such an announcement. Hong Kong is totally committed to enforcing a robust IPR protection regime, which is crucial to economic growth of Hong Kong and our continuation as a leading regional and global trading city. The Government has adopted a comprehensive strategy to combat copyright piracy, he said. The strategy covers such elements as enforcement action at retail, distribution and importation levels, implementation of new legislative measures to strengthen enforcement capabilities, tougher courts penalties on convicted copyright piracy offenders and strengthened liaison with copyright industry and other IPR enforcement authorities.

Shen Rengan, deputy director of the State Copyright Administration (SCA) in a keynote speech to a national copyright meeting, said that the smuggling of pirated products is still rampant, and problems are particularly serious on the market of book, audio and video, and electronic publications. And new copyright problems have been found in high-technology industries, particularly the information industry, he said, which will be a headache for China's economy. Yu Youxian, director of the SCA, told attendants at the meeting that the central government is attaching great importance to copyright protection, and they must pay the closest attention to the copyrights of books, periodicals, video and audio products, theatrical performances, television and radio broadcast, advertising and computer software. Shen said that in the coming two or three years China will revised its six-year-old Copyright Law, and establish a national anti-piracy union and a nationwide information network. Gang crimes will be particularly targeted, he said. In addition, China will create a number of institutes to provide services for copyright holders, continue to hold talks with foreign business people, and train law enforcers with the help of international organizations. Today's meeting revealed that China has since last year seized 53 illegal CD production lines, and confiscated millions of smuggled CDs and VCDs found to be pirated.

      "raw text: EISNER CALLS FOR WAR ON INTERNET PIRATES Disney Co. Chairman Michael Eisner urged Congress on Wednesday to protect copyrighted intellectual properties by enacting tough new curbs against piracy on the Internet, including mandating that computer manufacturers produce hardware with built-in safeguards against hacking.    Using clips from the new Disney animated feature ``Dinosaur'' as a prop, Eisner told an all-star lineup of Senate and House members at the Capitol luncheon that ``there is no way around it, theft is theft, whether it is enabled by a handgun or a computer keyboard.''    ``We have created a movie (`Dinosaur') that took four years to make, during which 45 million megabytes were crunched - enough to fill 70,000 CD-ROMs - all to generate data for an 80-minute film,'' Eisner said. ``Were it to fall in the wrong hands, it could be compressed onto a single DVD disc in a matter of minutes and put on the Internet while the movie is still in theaters.''    His announcement came amid growing worries in the entertainment industry over the impact of new broadband Internet technology. Broadband, now in an estimated 5 million homes nationwide, allows for much faster transmission and downloading of computer data, including digitized movies and music.    Using older Internet technology, it can take up to 24 hours to download a feature-length film. With broadband, the process can take 15 minutes.    Eisner specifically asked Congress to mandate that all computer and software manufacturers build anti-hacking systems into their products. He also called for an expanded international crackdown on piracy.    The Disney chief also announced that the entertainment industry plans to take a leading role in efforts to develop encryption and other security systems ``to stay one step ahead of the hackers.''    Eisner also called for a campaign to educate the public on the evils of copyright infringement. He also advocated a fair pricing policy for movies and music that would make pirated copies less attractive to consumers.    While Eisner expressed confidence that the computer industry would cooperate with the anti-piracy effort, he noted that some leaders of the high-tech sector are reluctant to put any access restrictions on the Internet.    ``I find it disingenuous of computer companies to fight copyright protections,'' said Eisner.    He warned that failure to curb piracy could lead to the demise of the Internet. Eisner said that if intellectual properties and income from such efforts are ``allowed to be pirated away, then the creative risk takers will put their energies elsewhere and the Internet will become a wonderful delivery system with nothing wonderful to deliver.''    Eisner told the lawmakers that legislation was the only real remedy, adding: ``Would the car companies have put in seat belts without a law?''    California Rep. Howard Berman, D-Mission Hills, the House's leading expert on copyright protection, expressed support for Eisner's proposal. He led the fight in 1998 for passage of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which bans the manufacture and import of technology that is specifically designed to facilitate piracy.    Berman is currently pushing a bill that would step up enforcement of copyright laws by the Justice Department.    ``We need to put more resources and a higher priority on this effort,'' Berman said. ``I believe a few high-profile prosecutions can have a tremendous effect on piracy.''    The film industry's effort to shut out pirates will be led by the Motion Picture Association of America. Jack Valenti, MPAA chairman and Hollywood's star Washington lobbyist, said Wednesday that he is putting together a team of experts ``to put a technological armor plate around our properties on the Internet.''    Valenti and Eisner said piracy of films is still in its infancy, given the limited access to broadband technology.
