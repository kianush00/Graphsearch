      "content": "ENGLISH\n\n\ngovernment protection against intellectual property (IP) theft. In\nSoutheast Asia, where the piracy rates are alarming, the calls for\nhelp are often rooted in desperation. Bear in mind that this is an\nindustry dealing with goods that are ridiculously easy to\nreproduce.\n\t   There are many ways to get the undivided attention of the\nauthorities and the public. Recently, the Business Software\nAlliance (BSA) announced the findings of a study to show people\nwhat is in it for them if piracy is lowered.\n\t   Conducted by Price Waterhouse (PW), the research shows how the\npackaged software industry contributes to the economies of\nIndonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and\nVietnam.\n\t   Packaged software covers business applications and leisure\nprograms.\n\t   Examples of business software are operating systems, word\nprocessors, spreadsheets, graphics, database management,\ncomputer-aided design and computer-aided engineering products, and\nnetworking software. Leisure programs include games, entertainment\nand educational software. The study excludes customised software.\n\t   Piracy is defined as `unauthorised copying and distribution of\ncopyrighted software products'.\n\t   The BSA-PW report on the study offers persuasive arguments as to\nwhy everybody (except maybe, the pirates) are better off without\nsoftware piracy, described as a `major drag' on the industry's\ngrowth. Using 1996 figures, the report argues that the industry is\nsignificant in terms of jobs and the government revenue it has\ncreated. This is followed with projected corresponding figures\nuntil the year 2001. The final part discusses the impact of piracy\nand how it would be if the piracy rate was lower.\n\t   According to the report, the Malaysian packaged software\nindustry accounted for US$298 million (US$1 &QC; RM3.80) in sales and\nUS$544.5 million in\ntotal economic activity in 1996. That year, it provided 3,656 jobs\nin software and supporting industries, and generated US$78.5\nmillion in direct and indirect taxes.\t   Between 1996 and 2001, the industry is expected to grow at an\naverage annual rate of 17.4 per cent, resulting in sales of\nUS$664.6 million and stimulating US$1.2 billion in economic\nactivity by 2001. These sales will create 5,548 jobs. The\ngovernment is projected to collect US$175 million from this\nexpansion.\n\t   What happens if the Malaysian piracy rate - 80 per cent in 1996\n-falls to the current US rate of 27 per cent? This leads to the\nmost compelling and interesting segment of the study.\n\t   (The folks at BSA will tell you that the only acceptable piracy\nrate is zero per cent, but PW picks the US rate as a realistic and\npractical point of reference.) If Malaysia's piracy rate in 1996\nwas 27 per cent instead of 80, there would have been an additional\n4,007 jobs and the government would have been richer by US$86\nmillion. By the year 2001, the packaged software industry could\naccount for 11,628 jobs and US$366.8 million in tax revenues.\n\t   Says the report, `In sum, software piracy harms the Malaysian\neconomy, curtails economic growth, constrains employment and limits\ntax contributions to the government.'",

Instead, as\nvice-president of American publishing software maker Adobe Systems\nInc, he was in Malaysia attending to business, which included\nspreading the anti-piracy gospel.\n\t   That day, he was at a function held to announce key findings of\na study on the Southeast Asian software industry. `I have incurred\nthe wrath of my wife by putting off the celebration to be here in\nKL. Looks like I'll have to make it up with a more expensive dinner\nand all that,' he says.\n\t   His remark on the price of placing work before domestic demands\nwas, of course, Freeman's way of injecting a little levity into a\nsombre event.\n\t   But he was dead serious when talking about the cost of software\npiracy. 'I believe if the Southeast Asian piracy rate was equal to\nthat of the United States, Adobe's income (in the region) would be\nthree to four times what it is now,' he complains.\n\t   According to estimates by international industry watchdog\nBusiness Software Alliance (BSA), the software piracy rates of\ncountries in this region are among the highest in the world. In\n1996, 84 per cent of the PC business software used or sold in\nSoutheast Asia comprised unauthorised copies with a market value of\nalmost US$600 million (US$1 &QC; RM3.80).\n\t   Malaysia's rate was 80 per cent (See Table 1). In comparison,\nthe US piracy level is currently 27 per cent. (Adobe Systems is a\nBSA member, as are other big players such as Autodesk Inc, Bentley\nSystems Inc, Lotus Development Corporation, Microsoft Corporation,\nNovell Inc and Symantec Corporation.) BSA commissioned Price\nWaterhouse to research the contribution of the packaged software\nindustry to the Southeast Asian economies. The exercise was\ncompleted last December.\n\t   BSA president Robert Holleyman singled out two conclusions. One,\nthe industry is significant - more than previously thought -\nthroughout the region in terms of jobs and revenue created. And\ntwo, it will become even more significant as governments step up\nanti-piracy enforcement.\n\t   Piracy is without doubt a pivotal issue in the Malaysian\nsoftware business (as it is in the rest of the region). One cannot\ndiscuss the industry without mentioning the `P' word.\n\t   To a significant extent, the success of the Multimedia Super\nCorridor (MSC) project rests upon adequate intellectual property\n(IP) protection.\n\t   This is precisely why the government has pledged to become `a\nregional leader in IP protection and cyberlaws'.\n\t   Part of the grand design is to make the MSC a development hub\nand export centre for software. The idea is to nurture over the\nnext 10 years a crop of local software makers who can compete\nregionally, if not globally.\n\t   To do this, it is important to enlist the help of the foreign\nsoftware titans. Microsoft instantly comes to mind. While in\nMalaysia last March, its chairman and CEO, Bill Gates, re-affirmed\nhis company's support for the MSC but gave scant details. In a New\nStraits Times interview, he had this to say about software piracy,\n`You never win the battle. It's an important issue but it's an\nissue where the trend is definitely positive.\n\t   There have been good steps taken in Malaysia but I certainly\nwouldn't say that we can relax.' Gates' top guy in Malaysia,\nMicrosoft (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd general manager Benedict Lee, expands\non the theme. `If you understand the government's drive to\ntransform the economy from an industrial one to one based on\ninformation, then you understand that we need to build a new\nsociety that can create software.\n\t   `But if piracy is prevalent, how are we going to attract our\nyounger generation into software development? They will think there\nis no revenue in it at all.' There are many others observing\nclosely Malaysia's war against the IP thieves. In its 1998 Foreign\nTrade Barriers Report released in April, the US Trade\nRepresentative touched on CD-based digital piracy. While praising\nthe Malaysian authorities' crackdown, the report points out some\nweak spots.\n\t   `Nevertheless, the presence and frequency of pirated videotapes\nand computer",

A report\nfrom the International Intellectual Property Alliance shows that\nthe U.S. copyright industry suffered an estimated 10.8 billion\nU.S. dollars in losses because of piracy in 55 countries.\n\n\nThe International Publishing Association regards reproducing of\ncopyrighted works of others without the authorization of the owner\nof copyright, without making remuneration and in most cases,\nwithout indicating the sources, piracy. This mainly involves the\nreproduction and distribution of books, periodicals, CDs, VCDs,\nmultimedia products, motion pictures and computer software.\n\n\nIn the last five years, Chinese copyright authorities have\ncampaigned against piracy frequently, seizing millions of pirated\nproducts and putting smugglers in prison, Shen says.\n\n\nThe revised Criminal Law states that these offenders may be\nsentenced to three to seven years in prison.\n\n\nPeople who help to seize illegal disk production lines can be\npaid up to 350,000 yuan (42,000 U.S. dollars) in reward money..\n\n\nCopyright pirates are a destructive force that disrupts the\nmarket economy and damages civilization, he says, but these\noffenders are becoming bolder and more sophisticated in\nreproducing and distributing pirated products.\n\n\nThe governments of various countries need a cooperative attitude\nand need to come together to crack down on illegal activities to\nstrengthen the international protection of intellectual property,\nhe concludes.",

(AP) -- Microsoft Corp. is suing 15 Florida  \ncompanies, alleging that they sold counterfeit versions of Windows \n95, Windows 98, and other company software. \n\n\n\tRedmond, Wash.-based Microsoft is the world's dominant maker of  \npersonal computer software. Its Windows operating system runs the \nbasic functions of 90 percent of the world's personal computers. \n\n\n\tThe lawsuits filed in federal courts seek unspecified damages  \nand a judge's order to stop distribution of the software, corporate \nattorney Nick Psyhogeos said Wednesday. \n\n\n\tThey come at a time when technology crimes are on the rise  \nthroughout Florida, according to police quoted in a company \nrelease. \n\n\n\t``We're finding a substantial increase of technology-related  \ncrime in the state,'' said Phil Ramer, director of the Florida \nDepartment of Law Enforcement's Office of Statewide Intelligence. \n``Organized crime rings have begun to include software piracy in \ntheir roster of other illegal activities because of the large sums \nof money that they stand to make.'' \n\n\n\tBusinesses, consumers and the government are the ones who  \nsuffer, company executives said. \n\n\n\tSoftware piracy cost Florida 7,186 jobs in 1997 and $490 million  \nin lost wages, tax revenue and retail sales, said Psyhogeos, citing \na Microsoft-commissioned study from International Planning &AMP; \nResearch Corp., a market research company. \n\n\n\tAnd counterfeit software, which often has viruses and bugs, does  \nnot come with technical support or warranty protection.

An array of local film\nand pop celebrities led a rally of 2,000 people to demand a tougher\ncrackdown on piracy.\n\n\n   Film producers say the Hong Kong film industry, once one of the\nlargest exporters of movies after Hollywood, has been devastated by\nthe explosive growth of movies illegally recorded onto compact\ndisks.\n\n\n   ``It's a downward spiral,'' said Woody Tsung, the chief\nexecutive of the Motion Picture Industry Association. ``The only\nway we can come out of this crisis is if the government gets rid of\npiracy.''\n\n\n   For all the doomsday talk, the protest Wednesday was a bubbly\naffair. Jackie Chan, perhaps Hong Kong's biggest star, showed up in\na black-suede jacket and matching pants to serve as the unofficial\nmarshal. As crowds squealed and cameras flashed, it was hard to\ntell the politics and the pop culture apart.\n\n\n   Hong Kong was taken off a watch list by the U.S. government last\nmonth after it stepped up efforts to raid factories that produce\nillegally copied material. But executives here say the former\nBritish colony remains one of the worst offenders in Asia for\ncopyright violations.\n\n\n   The protest rally also included representatives of the music,\ncable-television and computer-software industries _ all of whom\ncalled on the Hong Kong government to assign police officers to\nclose factories that make illegal software and to arrest the\nmerchants who peddle it.\n\n\n   Hong Kong's movie industry, in particular, has been damaged by\nthe advent of video compact disks, which can be bought for $2 in\nstores or at street stalls, often days before the films are\nreleased in theaters.\n\n\n   Tsung said the industry did not have reliable figures for how\nmuch money it loses each year as a result of illegally copied\nmovies. But he said the box office revenue of Hong Kong films\ndeclined from $168 million in 1993 to $54 million last year, and he\nattributed 95 percent of the decline to piracy.\n\n\n   Theater owners said they lost about $250,000 by shutting down\ncinemas Wednesday. They, too, contend that they are in a battle for\nsurvival. Five years ago, Hong Kong had 180 cinemas. Today, with so\nmany people buying bootleg disks instead of tickets to the local\nmultiplex, the number has fallen to 73.\n\n\n   ``It's incredible,'' said Rigo Jesu, an executive at the\nIntercontinental Group, which distributes films and operates\ncinemas here. ``I don't know of a situation like this anywhere else\nin the world.''\n\n\n   In the deserted lobby of Queen's Theater in central Hong Kong, a\nsign on the box office window apologized for being closed. It\nadded: ``Imagine a city without cinemas. If piracy is allowed to\ncontinue, this will be the result.''\n\n\n   In a signal that the government regards piracy as a grave issue,\nHong Kong's chief executive, Tung Chee-hwa, emerged from his office\nto accept a petition from the protesters. In a statement, he said:\n``We will not allow piracy or counterfeiting activities to tarnish\nHong Kong's reputation.''\n\n\n   On Tuesday, Customs officials conducted raids throughout the\nterritory and said they seized 350,000 pirated optical disks, worth\nan estimated $683,000, and arrested 37 suspects. In all of 1998,\nHong Kong seized 39 million pirated disks and arrested 1,645\npeople.\n\n\n   But industry executives said Hong Kong must assign the police to\ncrack down on the merchants who sell pirated software, since they\nare too widely dispersed for the 220 Customs officials to handle.\n\n\n   The problem extends beyond movies. More than half the sales of\nsome recordings in Hong Kong are generated by illegal copies,\naccording to Frank Brown, the president of MTV Networks Asia.\n``Hong Kong is amongst the worst in the region, though not as bad\nas India and China,'' Brown said.\n\n\n   Some executives have faulted the United States for lifting the\npressure on",

Intelligence is exchanged regularly and joint operations\nagainst notorious shopping centers and shops on the streets are\nmounted periodically,\" he noted.\n\n\nTo tackle the problem, he said the customs had redirected the\nenforcement strategy of the Intellectual Property Investigation\nBureau aiming at high-level piracy activities so as to track down\nthe source of pirated compact discs by taking proactive actions at\nthe manufacturing, storage and import or export levels.\n\n\nTsang said the move had been enhancing the effectiveness of\ntheir enforcement actions.\n\n\nHe also disclosed that intelligence suggested that after the\nrecent series of vigorous enforcement actions, many copyright\npirates had moved their illicit business to neighboring\nterritories.\n\n\nIn order to further strengthen the scope of Customs'\nenforcement, he went on, the government was considering the\nintroduction of other new legislation.\n\n\nTsang said like many other advanced places in the world, piracy\nin Hong Kong had become a social problem, which could not be\nsolved merely by legislative and enforcement means.\n\n\n\"Tough customs is only a law enforcement agency, we have\nrecently been working with other government departments and the\nindustry to heighten public awareness of the need to protect\nintellectual property rights,\" he added.",

The plant was generating $100,000 \na week, he said. \n\n\n\tPirated recordings, most often sold at outdoor markets and by  \nsmaller independent shops that run little risk of getting caught, \ntend to be identifiable by shoddily copied liner art, Berman said. \n\n\n\tBut the sound quality can be as good as the real thing, he  \nacknowledged. \n\n\n\tBerman said the organization is hampered by inadequate laws and  \nrelatively light penalties for music piracy. \n\n\n\t``No amount of investigative work on our part, no amount of  \nmoney, resources, time and effort will succeed in reducing these \nincredible levels of piracy if governments don't take effective \nenforcement actions that include both substantial fines and prison \nsentences,'' he said. \n\n\n\tThe industry has had a harder time stemming illegal music  \ncopying via the Internet. \n\n\n\tCurrently, its only recourse is trying to shut down Internet  \nsites with cease-and-desist orders, which it has done in thousands \nof cases. But there are an estimated 400,000 infringing sites left \nand more coming online every day, the federation said. \n\n\n\tThis battle has resulted in the formation of the Secured Digital  \nMusic Initiative, which seeks to develop a copyright directive that \nwill set ground rules for Internet music commerce, Berman said.",

      "content": "EISNER CALLS FOR WAR ON INTERNET PIRATES\n\n\n\n   &UR;  &LR; WASHINGTON _ Disney Co. Chairman Michael Eisner urged Congress\non Wednesday to protect copyrighted intellectual properties by\nenacting tough new curbs against piracy on the Internet, including\nmandating that computer manufacturers produce hardware with\nbuilt-in safeguards against hacking.\n\n\n   Using clips from the new Disney animated feature ``Dinosaur'' as\na prop, Eisner told an all-star lineup of Senate and House members\nat the Capitol luncheon that ``there is no way around it, theft is\ntheft, whether it is enabled by a handgun or a computer keyboard.''\n\n\n   ``We have created a movie (`Dinosaur') that took four years to\nmake, during which 45 million megabytes were crunched - enough to\nfill 70,000 CD-ROMs - all to generate data for an 80-minute film,''\nEisner said. ``Were it to fall in the wrong hands, it could be\ncompressed onto a single DVD disc in a matter of minutes and put on\nthe Internet while the movie is still in theaters.''\n\n\n   His announcement came amid growing worries in the entertainment\nindustry over the impact of new broadband Internet technology.\nBroadband, now in an estimated 5 million homes nationwide, allows\nfor much faster transmission and downloading of computer data,\nincluding digitized movies and music.\n\n\n   Using older Internet technology, it can take up to 24 hours to\ndownload a feature-length film. With broadband, the process can\ntake 15 minutes.\n\n\n   Eisner specifically asked Congress to mandate that all computer\nand software manufacturers build anti-hacking systems into their\nproducts. He also called for an expanded international crackdown on\npiracy.\n\n\n   The Disney chief also announced that the entertainment industry\nplans to take a leading role in efforts to develop encryption and\nother security systems ``to stay one step ahead of the hackers.''\n\n\n   Eisner also called for a campaign to educate the public on the\nevils of copyright infringement. He also advocated a fair pricing\npolicy for movies and music that would make pirated copies less\nattractive to consumers.\n\n\n   While Eisner expressed confidence that the computer industry\nwould cooperate with the anti-piracy effort, he noted that some\nleaders of the high-tech sector are reluctant to put any access\nrestrictions on the Internet.\n\n\n   ``I find it disingenuous of computer companies to fight\ncopyright protections,'' said Eisner.\n\n\n   He warned that failure to curb piracy could lead to the demise\nof the Internet. Eisner said that if intellectual properties and\nincome from such efforts are ``allowed to be pirated away, then the\ncreative risk takers will put their energies elsewhere and the\nInternet will become a wonderful delivery system with nothing\nwonderful to deliver.''\n\n\n   Eisner told the lawmakers that legislation was the only real\nremedy, adding: ``Would the car companies have put in seat belts\nwithout a law?''\n\n\n   California Rep. Howard Berman, D-Mission Hills, the House's\nleading expert on copyright protection, expressed support for\nEisner's proposal. He led the fight in 1998 for passage of the\nDigital Millennium Copyright Act, which bans the manufacture and\nimport of technology that is specifically designed to facilitate\npiracy.\n\n\n   Berman is currently pushing a bill that would step up\nenforcement of copyright laws by the Justice Department.\n\n\n   ``We need to put more resources and a higher priority on this\neffort,'' Berman said. ``I believe a few high-profile prosecutions\ncan have a tremendous effect on piracy.''\n\n\n   The film industry's effort to shut out pirates will be led by\nthe Motion Picture Association of America. Jack Valenti, MPAA\nchairman and Hollywood's star Washington lobbyist, said Wednesday\nthat he is putting together a team of experts ``to put a\ntechnological armor plate around our properties on the Internet.''\n\n\n   Valenti and Eisner said piracy of films is still in its infancy,\ngiven the limited access to broadband technology. And many films\nposted on the Internet are of poor quality, including some\nvideotaped off theater screens.\n\n\n   But both men w",
