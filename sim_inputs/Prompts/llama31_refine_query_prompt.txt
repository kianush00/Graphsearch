You are assisting an interactive search system.
CONTEXT
-------
• Current query string: {query_terms.strip()}
• Current query topic (verbatim):
---- START OF TOPIC ----
{topic.strip()}
---- END OF TOPIC ----

• 100 candidate refinement terms (sorted by descending score): 
[{', '.join(top_sorted_proximity_terms)}]

TASK
----
Based on the topic above, choose **between 1 and 2** terms from the candidate refinement 
list that you consider most relevant for expanding the original query.
In case you consider using a more relevant term obtained directly from the topic text, you 
can also use terms from there, instead of the candidate refinement list.
Then, produce a **refined query** by appending those terms to the original query string.
Finally, provide a brief justification for each added term.

RESPONSE FORMAT (strict JSON):
{
"refined_query": "<the original query string **with the 1-2 chosen terms added**, 
separated by spaces>",
"added_terms": ["<term1>", "<term2>"],
"justification": "<brief rationale for each added term>"
}

Respond **only** with the JSON object, no extra text.
