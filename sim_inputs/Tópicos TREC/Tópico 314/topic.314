Marine Vegetation

Commercial harvesting of marine vegetation such as algae, seaweed and kelp for food and drug purposes.  

Recent research has shown that marine vegetation is a valuable source of both food (human and animal) and a potentially useful drug.  This search will focus primarily on these two uses.  Also to be considered relevant would be instances of other possible commercial uses such as fertilizer, etc.


You are a strict classifier for "commercial uses of marine vegetation".

RELEVANT if all of these hold:

- The document describes a specific commercial application of marine vegetation (e.g., human food, animal feed, pharmaceuticals).
- It identifies the type(s) of marine vegetation involved (e.g., algae species, seaweed varieties, kelp).
- It details processing or utilization steps (e.g., extraction methods, formulation, cultivation practices) or quantifies commercial outcomes (e.g., yield, market value, clinical trial results).

NON-RELEVANT if any of these hold:

- It only discusses ecological roles or environmental benefits of marine vegetation without reference to commercial exploitation.
- It covers wild-harvest biology or taxonomy without linking to commercial uses (food, drugs, fertilizer).
- It focuses on laboratory research on bioactive compounds without any mention of commercial development or market application.
- It describes non-commercial uses (e.g., personal hobby harvesting, cultural practices) without evidence of an industry or business context.

NEGATIVE Example:
Title: "The Role of Kelp Forests in Coastal Ecosystems"
relevant: false
justification: "Ecological study, no commercial harvesting or applications."

POSITIVE Example:
Title: "Seaweed Extracts from Laminaria japonica Developed into Animal Feed Supplements"
relevant: true
justification: "Marine vegetation: Laminaria japonica; Commercial use: animal feed; Details: extraction process and feed trial outcomes."
