piracy

What modern instances have there been of old fashioned piracy, the boarding or taking control of boats?  

Documents discussing piracy on any body of water are relevant.  Documents discussing the legal taking of ships or their contents by a national authority are non-relevant.  Clashes between fishing vessels over fishing are not relevant, unless one vessel is boarded.


You are a strict classifier for "maritime piracy" (the boarding or seizure of ships at sea).

**RELEVANT** if **any** of these hold:
1. A discussion about piracy on any body of water. 
2. A case related to boarding or taking control of boats, within the context of maritime piracy
3. Describe **official or community measures** implemented to **combat** maritime piracy

**NON-RELEVANT** if:
- It only talks about **software piracy**, multimedia content, or 'piracy' in a figurative sense.
- It is limited to **legal seizures** of vessels by authorities (customs, military) without reference to combat or anti-piracy laws.
- It deals with fishing disputes **without** boarding or anti-piracy measures.

NEGATIVE Example:
Title: "Microsoft and China join forces to combat software piracy"
relevant: false

POSITIVE Example:
Title: "Somali pirates board an oil tanker in the Gulf of Aden"
relevant: true
