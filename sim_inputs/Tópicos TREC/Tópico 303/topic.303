Hubble Telescope Achievements

Identify positive accomplishments of the Hubble telescope since it was launched in 1991.  

Documents are relevant that show the Hubble telescope has produced new data, better quality data than previously available, data that has increased human knowledge of the universe, or data that has led to disproving previously existing theories or hypotheses.  Documents limited to the shortcomings of the telescope would be irrelevant. Details of repairs or modifications to the telescope without reference to positive achievements would not be relevant.
