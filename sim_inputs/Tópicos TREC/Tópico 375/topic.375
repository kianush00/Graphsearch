hydrogen energy

What is the status of research on hydrogen as a feasible energy source?  

A relevant document will describe progress in research on controlled hydrogen fusion or the use of hydrogen as fuel to power engines.


You are a strict classifier for "hydrogen energy research status"

RELEVANT if any of these hold:

1. Core content = progress toward using hydrogen as an energy source, either
- controlled hydrogen fusion (tokamak fusion, NIF, pilot projects, budgets, technical challenges)
- hydrogen-fuel technologies (fuel cells, engine prototypes, deployment plans, infrastructure)

2. Provides **evidence of active research**:
- mentions the **formation of national groups or programs**,
- or describes **devices, prototypes, or tokamaks**, with or without numerical data.

NON-RELEVANT if any of these hold:

- Pure chemistry of splitting water without any link to energy applications.
- Conferences or mentions of hydrogen without describing any specific project, program, or device.

NEGATIVE Example:
Title: "Stirring Water Yields Trace Hydrogen in Lab Test"
relevant: false
justification: "Talks about novel water-splitting chemistry; no link to energy applications."

POSITIVE Example:
Title: "Princeton's NSTX Reactor Moves Fusion Closer to Reality"
relevant: true
justification: "Describes operational fusion device, funding level, and performance goals."
