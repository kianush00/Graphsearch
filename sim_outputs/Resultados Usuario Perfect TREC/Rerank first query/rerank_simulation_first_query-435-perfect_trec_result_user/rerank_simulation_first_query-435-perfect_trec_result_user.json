Experts fear that if India's rate of population growth does\nnot slow, it will become the world's most populated country in 45\nyears.\n\n\n   Vajpayee urged companies, voluntary agencies and individuals to\ncontribute to the National Population Stabilization Fund, which\nwould direct the money to family planning programs. He gave very\nfew details of the programs, but said he hoped the population would\nstabilize within two decades.\n\n\n   ''Achieving this is a challenge. But once we overcome the\nchallenge, we can truly develop our national human resource into a\nformidable force ... for all-around prosperity,'' he said.\n\n\n   The state-run Planning Commission will provide $22.5 million for\nthe fund, officials said.\n\n\n   He urged states to make good use of health, education and\nrelated development programs and provide better access to\ninformation on contraception and child care.\n\n\n   In 1952, India adopted a national family planning program, the\nfirst country in the world to do so. The aim was to ''reduce the\nbirth rate to the extent necessary to stabilize the population at a\nlevel consistent with the requirement of the national economy.''\n\n\n   But many Indians, especially women, were without basic health\ncare, or the literacy skills to understand family planning.\n\n\n   ''A reality check ... reveals rather disturbing facts,''\nVajpayee said. Nearly one in 10 children dies before the age of\nfive, he said. Half of the children under the age of four are\nundernourished; 30 percent of the newborns are underweight and 60\npercent of women are anemic.\n\n\n   Vajpayee said India must reduce infant and maternal mortality\nand meet the demand for contraception. Condoms are available, but\nthe condom campaign is aimed mostly at preventing sexually\ntransmitted diseases. In a country where millions are at or below\nthe poverty level and live in rural areas, spending money on\ncondoms is not a consideration.\n\n\n   The National Commission on Population includes federal and state\ngovernments, voluntary agencies and individuals and aims at\npromoting better coordination among various agencies to curb\npopulation growth.\n\n\n AP-NY-07-22-00 1453",

      "content": "POPULATION CONTROL MEASURES TO AID WOMEN ARE STUMBLING  \n(DW)\n\n\n\n   UNITED NATIONS _ A consensus reached at a 180-nation conference\nin Cairo, Egypt, five years ago on a new strategy for limiting\nworld population growth by improving the status of women is now\nfacing serious religious, ideological and financial difficulties.\n\n\n   The new strategy would allow the world's population to rise from\nits present level of about 5.9 billion people to close to 9.8\nbillion by the year 2050, and then hold it at around that level.\n\n\n   But a review conference convened here at the end of last month\nto see what progress countries were making toward the Cairo goals\nbroke up with barely half its work completed.\n\n\n   Instead of comparing experiences with the Cairo program, the 180\ngovernments represented spent days wrangling over such sensitive\nissues as abortion, contraception, sex education for teen-agers and\nwomen's rights to the frustration of the more than 700 private\norganizations interested in population and women's issues attending\nthe session.\n\n\n   The meeting did not even discuss money for the Cairo program. It\nis increasingly unclear whether the world will be able to raise\nspending on population policies from $10 billion a year at present\nto the $17 billion required under the new strategy in the year\n2000, or the nearly $22 billion needed by 2015 at a time when\nWestern aid to developing nations is falling.\n\n\n   ``We are having a replay of the differences which surfaced at\nCairo by some of the countries who feel they lost out then,''\nacknowledged Bangladesh's representative, Anwarul Karim Chowdhury,\nchairman of the review conference, which will reconvene next month\nto complete its work.\n\n\n   ``We are sorry to see a meeting that was supposed to take stock\nof how countries are implementing the Cairo program turn into an\nattempt to renegotiate that program,'' said Anika Rahman, of the\nCenter for Reproductive Law and Policy, one of the private lobbying\ngroups attending the talks.\n\n\n   Citing a ``huge gap between promises and performance,'' June\nPersaud, the Guyanese delegate who spoke for the Group of 77, as\nthe 130 developing member countries of the United Nations call\nthemselves, predicted the industrialized world will provide only 33\npercent of the $5.7 billion it is supposed to contribute to the\nprogram by 2000.\n\n\n   Unlike earlier U.N. efforts to curb population growth, which\nemphasized numerical targets, the Cairo strategy assumes women will\nautomatically limit the size of their families as they become\nhealthier, richer and more educated and enjoy a higher social\nstatus.\n\n\n   It calls for universal access to reproductive and sexual health\ncare by 2015 as well as universal access to primary education,\ngender equality and sharp reductions in infant, child and maternal\nmortality.\n\n\n   ``Cairo marks a shift in emphasis in population policy from\ntargets and numbers to improving women's lives,'' said Rosalind P.\nPetchesky, of the International Reproductive Rights Research Action\nGroup. ``You won't stem population growth without bettering the lot\nof women.''\n\n\n   But instead of using last month's review conference to compare\nnational experiences in carrying out the Cairo program, delegates\nfound themselves locked in a linguistic struggle over what they\nshould say about a number of sensitive subjects in the report they\nwill present to a special session of the U.N. General Assembly in\nJuly.\n\n\n   A loose coalition of conservative Roman Catholic and Muslim\ncountries, led by the Vatican and including Argentina, Nicaragua,\nGuatemala, Chile, Libya, Sudan, Algeria and Malta, sought\ncontinually to water down commitments made at Cairo.\n\n\n   They balked, for instance, at a pledge to ensure abortions are\nsafe for women legally entitled to them.\n\n\n   They sought to bolster parental authority at the expense of\neducating young people about sex and providing them with\nindependent health care. They opposed any endorsement of so-called\n``emergency contraception,'' which destroys a fertilized egg before\nit becomes implanted in the uterine wall, making",

The policy has turned China into a\nlow birth rate country and churned out many young single children.\n\n\nThe policy does not prohibit a husband and wife who are both\nsingle children from bearing a second baby. However, this is the\nfirst time governments have turned to the law to protect the right.\n\n\nSong says that local governments approved the laws because they\nwant to tackle the aging population problem and maintain a\npopulation balance.\n\n\nThe proportion of people aged over 70 in the total population\nhas increased rapidly to 10 percent in the 20-year course of the\none-child policy, which has put pressure on society.\n\n\nSong says the promulgation of the local laws goes in line with\nthe normal population growth, and noted that there will not be an\nabrupt increase in the Chinese population in the coming years.\n\n\nA survey in Heilongjiang province shows that 69.9 percent of 1,\n0200 respondents aged between 20 and 30 are reluctant to have a\nsecond child.\n\n\nLi Ling, a company clerk in Harbin, noted that having another\nbaby \"will cost a lot of money and make me and my husband tired.\"\n\n\nXie Zhenming, deputy director of the China Population\nInformation Research Institute, says that by 2005 some 20 million\nmarriages will take place in China annually, and only 10 percent\nof the couples will be single children.\n\n\nHe said that if each couple has two children, the added\npopulation will be no more than two million every year, which\nwould have little affect on the nation's population control target.\n\n\nThe Chinese government published a report last month saying\nthat it will bring the population to under 1.4 billion by 2010 and\nthe current birth control policy should be stabilized.\n\n\nMany provinces have increased subsidies for families with one\nchild.",

      "content": "WORLD CONFERENCE SPLITS ON CURBING POPULATION GROWTH \n\n\n\n   UNITED NATIONS _ With time running out, a 180-nation conference\nstruggling to repair a shattered consensus on limiting world\npopulation growth was still divided Tuesday over issues ranging\nfrom abortion and family planning to sex education in schools.\n\n\n   On Wednesday, the conference is supposed to present an updated\naction plan to a special session of the U.N. General Assembly. But\nif the conference is still not ready, it may continue its\ndiscussions in parallel with the General Assembly debate.\n\n\n   But Tuesday night a comparatively small group of conservative\nRoman Catholic and Muslim developing countries, with strong support\nfrom the Vatican, was blocking final agreement on several key\naspects of the plan.\n\n\n   Five years ago in Cairo, the countries meeting this week agreed\nthat the best way to curb population growth is not by setting\nnumerical targets and mounting birth-control campaigns. Instead,\nthey decided to try to improve the social status, education and\nhealth of young women and men in the belief they will then limit\nthe size of their families.\n\n\n   This so-called Cairo strategy is designed to let the world's\npopulation rise from some 6 billion at present to 9.8 billion by\n2050 and thereafter hold it at around that level.\n\n\n   But difficulties arose last March when the nations who had first\nagreed upon the Cairo strategy met at the United Nations in New\nYork to draw up an action plan for completing it.\n\n\n   Conservatives used this meeting to reopen key portions by\ninserting language playing down family planning, restricting\nabortion and asserting parental control over children's health and\nsex education.\n\n\n   While the composition of this group varies from issue to issue,\nprominent members include Libya, Sudan, Morocco, Guatemala,\nNicaragua and Argentina as well as the Vatican.\n\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n\n   Paying for the Cairo program is also problematic.\n\n\n   On Tuesday night the conference agreed to reaffirm earlier\npledges on financing the program, which is expected to cost $17\nbillion in 2000, rising to $21.7 billion by 2017.\n\n\n   The pledges commit developing countries to pay two-thirds of the\ntotal and the industrialized world the rest. But both are well\nbehind on their obligations so far. Industrialized countries, which\npromised at Cairo to pay $5.7 billion a year, have contributed only\n$1.9 billion a year on average so far. Developing nations, which\nwere supposed to pay $ 11.3 billion annually, have paid $7.8\nbillion a year on average, with most of that money being spent by\nChina, India, Brazil, Mexico and Indonesia.\n\n\n   Donors have done even worse, however. Their total contributions\nare running at $1.9 billion a year, although at Cairo they pledged\nto provide $5.7 billion annually.\n\n\n   After the April meeting failed to reach agreement the conference\nwas reconvened here last week. But Tuesday night it was still\ndivided on several important issues.\n\n\n   For example, conservatives dislike a call for governments to\nprovide young people with confidential advice on contraceptives and\nreproductive health care, demanding greater parental oversight.\n\n\n   ``If the services are not confidential, young people won't use\nthem,'' said Ardrienne Germaine, president of the International\nWomen's Health Coalition, a New York-based women's group.\n\n\n   Also unpopular with conservative groups is a Mexican proposal to\nencourage sex education in school curricula in order to promote\n``responsible sexual behavior'' and to protect adolescents from\n``pregnancy, unsafe abortion and sexually transmitted diseases.''\n\n\n   Although most nations in the world support the Cairo program,\nthe small conservative faction is able to exercise disproportionate\ninfluence over the roughly 130 developing members of the United\nNations, because these countries try to vote as a bloc.\n\n\n   And all members accept that an agreement that is primarily\nintended to help the developing world reduce its growing population\nwill have little value if these countries",

They believe\nthe government was unable to solve its twin dilemma of curbing\nunemployment and poverty while putting a lid on public\nexpenditures, and keeping the deficit below 7 percent.\n\n\nWith the 7 percent deficit ceiling, the government can hardly\nachieve a growth rate higher than 3 percent in 1999, economists\nsaid.\n\n\nThey believed Jordan needed at least a 6 percent economic\ngrowth to cope with the population growth rate of the country,\nwhich stood at 3 percent last year.",

      "content": "WORLD CONFERENCE SPLITS ON CURBING POPULATION GROWTH \n\n\n\n   UNITED NATIONS _ With time running out, a 180-nation conference\nstruggling to repair a shattered consensus on limiting world\npopulation growth was still divided Tuesday over issues ranging\nfrom abortion and family planning to sex education in schools.\n\n\n   On Wednesday, the conference is supposed to present an updated\naction plan to a special session of the U.N. General Assembly. But\nif the conference is still not ready, it may continue its\ndiscussions in parallel with the General Assembly debate.\n\n\n   But Tuesday night a comparatively small group of conservative\nRoman Catholic and Muslim developing countries, with strong support\nfrom the Vatican, was blocking final agreement on several key\naspects of the plan.\n\n\n   Five years ago in Cairo, the countries meeting this week agreed\nthat the best way to curb population growth is not by setting\nnumerical targets and mounting birth-control campaigns. Instead,\nthey decided to try to improve the social status, education and\nhealth of young women and men in the belief they will then limit\nthe size of their families.\n\n\n   This so-called Cairo strategy is designed to let the world's\npopulation rise from some 6 billion at present to 9.8 billion by\n2050 and thereafter hold it at around that level.\n\n\n   But difficulties arose last March when the nations who had first\nagreed upon the Cairo strategy met at the United Nations in New\nYork to draw up an action plan for completing it.\n\n\n   Conservatives used this meeting to reopen key portions by\ninserting language playing down family planning, restricting\nabortion and asserting parental control over children's health and\nsex education.\n\n\n   While the composition of this group varies from issue to issue,\nprominent members include Libya, Sudan, Morocco, Guatemala,\nNicaragua and Argentina as well as the Vatican.\n\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n\n   Paying for the Cairo program is also problematic.\n\n\n   Its cost was estimated at $17 billion in 2000 rising to $21.7\nbillion in 2015 with developing countries supposed to pay\ntwo-thirds and industrial countries the remainder. Both groups are\nwell behind in their contributions.\n\n\n   So far developing countries, which were expected to provide $\n11.3 billion a year, have spent only $7.8 billion a year on\naverage, with most of this occurring in China, Brazil, Mexico and\nIndonesia.\n\n\n   Donors have done even worse, however. Their total contributions\nare running at $1.9 billion a year, although at Cairo they pledged\nto provide $5.7 billion annually.\n\n\n   After the April meeting failed to reach agreement the conference\nwas reconvened here last week. But Tuesday night it was still\ndivided on several important issues.\n\n\n   For example, conservatives dislike a call for governments to\nprovide young people with confidential advice on contraceptives and\nreproductive health care, demanding greater parental oversight.\n\n\n   ``If the services are not confidential, young people won't use\nthem,'' said Ardrienne Germaine, president of the International\nWomen's Health Coalition, a New York-based women's group.\n\n\n   Also unpopular with conservative groups is a Mexican proposal to\nencourage sex education in school curricula in order to promote\n``responsible sexual behavior'' and to protect adolescents from\n``pregnancy, unsafe abortion and sexually transmitted diseases.''\n\n\n   Although most nations in the world support the Cairo program,\nthe small conservative faction is able to exercise disproportionate\ninfluence over the roughly 130 developing members of the United\nNations, because these countries try to vote as a bloc.\n\n\n   And all members accept that an agreement that is primarily\nintended to help the developing world reduce its growing population\nwill have little value if these countries do not formally endorse\nit.\n\n\n   By making improvements in the lives of young people the key to\npopulation control, the Cairo strategy builds on the results of two\nearlier major U.N. conferences.\n\n\n   At their 1992 Earth Summit meeting in Rio de Janei",

But, my first two children were girls who couldn't drive\nthe camels to do heavy work. So I had a third child -- a boy who\nis now six years old.\"\n\n\nShe said the local government understood her difficulties and\nwhen she was about to have her third child, they arranged for a\nspecial medical team that drove more than 100 kilometers to her\nhouse.\n\n\nChina adopted its one-child policy in the late 1970s to curb\nthe dramatic population growth, but eased family planning\nrestrictions for families of ethnic groups, even though family\nplanning was also advocated for better economic and cultural\ndevelopment in ethnic areas and to improve the quality of their\nlives.\n\n\nLiu Zhilan, the director of the Family Planning Commission of\nthe Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, said that the 48 ethnic\ngroups there include Mongolians, Huis, and Manchus, most of them\nliving in border areas that are sparsely populated and with a\nharsh environment.\n\n\nInner Mongolia covers 1.18 million square kilometers, 12.3\npercent of China's total landspace, and has a population of 23\nmillion, which accounts for 1.8 percent of the nation's total. The\nregion's birth rate stands at 9.6 per thousand, lower than the\ncountry's average.\n\n\nFifty years ago, the Mongolian population, the major ethnic\ngroup there, had declined sharply. These people, with their\nglorious history, had only 680,000 people when the autonomous\nregion was established in 1947.\n\n\nThe number of Mongolians came to 3.7 million, accounting for\n15.8 of the region's total population, and the group's birth rate\nwas 20 per thousand. Other minority groups amounted to nearly\n850,000 people and had a birth rate of 15 per thousand.\n\n\nLiu said that since the early 1950s the central government has\nsent a large number of medical personnel to the vast Inner\nMongolian grasslands to combat epidemic and infectious diseases\nlike plague and venereal disease.

However, the women of\nother minority groups still expect to have more children.\n\n\nLiu Zhilan, who has been involved in family planning for more\nthan 20 years, says that the regional government has focused on\nimproving the quality of life in the ethnic population rather than\ncurbing their numbers.\n\n\nThe region has several hundred schools and family planning\nservice centers for the nomadic population.

The increase in discharged pollutants has been\neffectively curbed by the closing down of 62,000 seriously\npolluting enterprises;\n\n\n-- More attention has been given to forest cultivation and a\nnation-wide voluntary afforestation drive. Man-made forests now\ncover 34.25 million hectares. Forest coverage increased from 12.98\npercent in 1992 to 13.92 percent in 1996;\n\n\n-- Greater efforts have been devoted to preserving\nbio-diversity. A network of nature reserves has basically taken\nshape, covering 71.85 million hectares or 7.2 percent of China's\ntotal territory.

      "content": "ENERGY _ EVERYBODY WANTS MORE\n\n\n\n   When you hear the term ``Big Oil,'' it conjures up images of\nglobal behemoths such as Exxon-Mobil and Royal Dutch/Shell. It's\nhard to imagine anybody kicking these multinational giants around.\n\n\n   But American politicians and motorists regularly do. Whenever\ngasoline prices shoot upward, as they have this year, Big Oil takes\nit on the chin.\n\n\n   For the most part, though, it's a bum rap. If Big Oil could\nmanipulate gas prices at will, as its critics infer, you wouldn't\nsee the precipitous price declines such as occurred in early 1999,\nwhen the average U.S. pump price cratered to 99 cents a gallon.\n\n\n   Energy prices are dictated primarily by powerful market forces\nof supply and demand. They also can be affected by government\npolicies such as raising fuel taxes and by supply disruptions such\nas pipeline breaks.\n\n\n   The biggest sustained upward pressure on energy prices comes\nfrom two factors largely ignored by politicians, consumers and the\nnews media: enormous worldwide population growth and growing energy\ndemand in developing countries where people are steadily buying\nmore cars, appliances and other energy-eating goods.\n\n\n   After the oil price shocks of the late 1970s and early 1980s,\nthe world became more fuel-stingy. Cars, home heating and cooling\nsystems, and industrial operations became far more energy-efficient\nin the wake of $35-a-barrel crude.\n\n\n   But those efficiency gains have been more than offset by huge\npopulation increases and rising worldwide energy consumption. Even\nthough global oil output has risen, demand has grown every bit as\nfast.\n\n\n   The world population hit 6 billion last fall, virtually double\nthe number when John F. Kennedy was elected president in 1960.\n\n\n   In the last 12 years, another billion people have been added to\nthe planet. That increase is nearly four times the 275 million\npeople in the United States, the third most populous country in the\nworld (behind China, with 1.2 billion people, and India, with 1\nbillion).\n\n\n   The U.S. Energy Information Administration has projected that\nworld energy consumption will jump by a staggering 60 percent from\n1997 to 2020. Population gains and greatly heightened purchases of\nenergy-consuming goods in developing countries will be overwhelming\nfactors in this growth.\n\n\n   While U.S. energy consumption is projected to rise 28 percent in\nthat period, the EIA forecasts that China will experience an\nimmense 265 percent increase and India a 231 percent jump.\n\n\n   China is expected to be gobbling 9.5 million barrels of oil\nevery 24 hours in 2020 _ more than four times the 2.3 million\nbarrels it used daily in 1990.\n\n\n   In 1997, only 10 Chinese in 1,000 owned cars; by 2020, 54 in\n1,000 will _ a fivefold increase, the EIA forecasts.\n\n\n   The EIA expects that the fossil fuels of oil, natural gas and\ncoal will still be the world's prime energy sources in 2020.\n\n\n   The $64 question is how much impact a continued sharp rise in\nglobal population and energy consumption will have not only on oil\nand gasoline prices but in contributing to pollution and global\nwarming.\n\n\n   Scott Tinker, director of the Bureau of Economic Geology at the\nUniversity of Texas in Austin, says of the prospects for\nmushrooming energy use in large developing countries, ``It's a\nscary thought when a billion people in India and well over a\nbillion people in China go through an industrial revolution.''\n\n\n   Given all these ominous numbers, it's obvious that we must\naccelerate the agenda for developing more fuel-efficient vehicles,\nbetter mass transit systems, promising energy technologies such as\nfuel cells, and improved means of curbing air pollution.\n\n\n   We also should think much harder about whether we want to keep\nadding another billion people to the globe every dozen years or so.\n\n\n   (Jack Z.

      "content": "STUDY FORECASTS BEARISH TIMES FOR NEW YORK'S ECONOMY \n\n\n\n   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Wall Street's boom has artificially lifted New\nYork's economy and masked underlying weak job growth, particularly\nin upstate New York, according to a study by a leading private\neconomic consulting firm.\n\n\n   New York state's employment growth will be the slowest in the\nnation from 1998 to 2002, at an average of 0.4 percent a year, the\nStandard &AMP; Poor's DRI study said.\n\n\n   The government quickly denounced the report.\n\n\n   ``It's completely wrong,'' said Stephen Kagann, chief economist\nfor Gov. George Pataki. ``I'm surprised by it, stunned by it. I\ncan't believe they put this out.''\n\n\n   Kagann said the number of new factories and businesses in New\nYork had soared in the last few years, which means there will be\neven more jobs in the future.\n\n\n   ``The turnaround in New York's economy is not a temporary\nphenomenon,'' Kagann said.\n\n\n   The Business Council of New York State Inc. said the report\nfailed to recognize the state's gains.\n\n\n   The study by the Lexington, Mass.-based Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI\npredicted an ``economic slowdown over the next five years'' brought\non by weak population growth and income gains harmed by job cuts in\nmanufacturing and commercial banking.\n\n\n   As a result, the study said, limited demand for goods and\nservices will curb expansion of retail, service and real estate\nmarkets. Kagann said that the next time the national economy turns\nnegative, New York will fare better than in the past because of tax\ncuts.\n\n\n   ``I expect that when we have the next national downturn, we will\ndo much, much better,'' he said.\n\n\n   The study said the recent surge in stock market profits spurred\neconomic growth in metropolitan New York and boosted personal\nincome levels by 5.3 percent last year, including a record $10.2\nbillion in Wall Street bonuses.\n\n\n   The study said that improvement led to last year's expansion in\nconsumer and retail trade, the largest percentage gain in total\nemployment since 1988 and a $1.8 billion state budget surplus.\n\n\n   Nonetheless, the study said, the advances could be short-lived,\nbecause New York's population is growing by 0.1 percent a year and\npersonal income growth is expected to be the eighth lowest in the\nnation in the next few years.\n\n\n   ``Financial services generates nearly 30 percent of New York's\ngross state product,'' said Standard &AMP; Poor's economist Sara\nJohnson, ``but the concentration of financial service companies in\nNew York City and Long Island makes the state uniquely vulnerable\nto volatility in the U.S. securities market.''\n\n\n   She said that even though New York has a diverse economy, its\ndependence on financial services is risky in the short term.\n\n\n   Business Council spokesman Robert Ward said that Wall Street,\nwhile an inherently risky place, is only going to grow in the\nfuture as more money continues to pour into stocks, especially if\nSocial Security privatizes some of its investments.\n\n\n   But Ward said he agreed with the study's call for further tax\ncuts and improvements in the business climate.\n\n\n   The study said the state's high tax rates and uncompetitive\ncosts are driving out businesses.\n\n\n   ``New York is now losing market share in every sector of the\neconomy,'' Johnson said.\n\n\n   Johnson did praise Pataki's Republican administration for recent\neconomic policies.\n\n\n   ``Fortunately, state government is addressing the high cost of\ndoing business by lowering corporate and property taxes,'' she\nsaid. ``These initiatives should have a positive impact.''\n\n\n   The study doesn't provide an unremittingly bleak view of New\nYork's economy. It says that New York will enjoy another year of\nsolid employment gains in 1998, about 1.4 percent growth.\n\n\n   But it said employment growth will slow in the next few years\nbecause of hits to commercial banking and manufacturing.",

      "content": "CHECK THE FED'S PULSE. CALL US IN THE LONG TERM \n\n\n\n   James W. Paulsen, the chief investment officer at Wells Capital\nManagement in Minneapolis, says he is only tilting. Marshall Acuff,\nthe equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney, is just moving at\nthe margin. And Jeffrey M. Applegate, the chief United States\nstrategist at Lehman Brothers, is only trimming his expectations\nfor returns.\n\n\n   These three strategists and others all had to review their\noutlooks last week to accommodate the fact that the Federal Reserve\nis now leaning toward raising its short-term interest rate target,\nthe federal funds rate.\n\n\n   While no one knows when, or even if, the Fed will raise rates,\nthe policy makers have made it clear that if inflation does tick\nup, they will move quickly.\n\n\n   But according to these strategists, this bias toward higher\ninterest rates will not force them to make big changes in what they\nhave been doing.\n\n\n   Even if the rally does not run wild, these analysts still expect\nstocks to rise. Paulsen says the bond market will rally. Applegate\nis betting that the Fed will not increase rates to slow growth and\ncurb inflation. Paulsen doesn't think the Fed will have to raise\nrates _ though he says it is still a possibility. Acuff thinks any\nrate increase will be modest.\n\n\n   Paulsen has shifted his asset allocation slightly, to benefit\nfrom the bond rally he expects when it becomes clear that inflation\nwill not get out of hand. So he is cutting his allocation to stocks\nto 60 percent, from 70 percent, while raising bonds to 40 percent,\nfrom 30 percent.\n\n\n   ``I am not so negative on stocks,'' he said, explaining this\nshift. ``I just think that bonds might meet them tick for tick.''\n\n\n   He is also suggesting a small shift in the composition of stock\nportfolios. He thinks economic growth will slow, partly because of\nthe rise in oil prices, the slower growth in real wages and the\nslump in mortgage refinancings. All three will curb consumer\nspending, which has been the driving force of the economy's still\nrapid growth.\n\n\n   For Paulsen, a slowdown makes growth stocks, especially the\nbig-name companies that can produce solid earnings in a weaker\neconomy, attractive again. He also likes financial stocks, which\nwill benefit from declining market rates, and consumer staples,\nwhich also do well in a slower-growth environment.\n\n\n   But that does not mean he is dumping all his cyclical stocks,\nwhich have done very well this year. ``I believe you should tilt in\nthe direction you think the market is going,'' Paulsen said. ``But\nI am not selling all my cyclicals. I known I can be wrong.''\n\n\n   Applegate is also shifting out of cyclicals and into growth\nstocks. ``The cyclical trade has come and gone,'' he said. But he\nis holding his asset allocation at 80 percent stocks and 20 percent\nbonds.\n\n\n   The recent rise in interest rates has curbed the expansion in\nvaluations that would help stocks move higher, he said, but\ncorporate earnings forecasts are improving. His firm just raised\nits 1999 operating earnings forecast to 10 percent, from 8 percent.\nHis year-end target for the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index is\nunchanged at 1,450, 9 percent above Friday's close.\n\n\n   And Applegate would not think of trying to shift out of stocks\nto sidestep a slump. He did not even do that last year, when the\nmajor market indexes plunged 19 percent or more, because he worried\nthat he would not get back in quickly enough.\n\n\n   Why so sanguine? Because there is confidence that the Fed will\nnot let inflation get out of hand, which means that the long-term\nstill looks fine. And because the investing environment had, in\nfact, changed long before the Fed announcement.\n\n\n   Investors had worried most of this year about a Fed rate\nincrease because the economy refused to slow down. The jump in\nlong-term interest rates by a percentage point, to 5.92 percent\nsince December, was a result.\n\n\n   Abby Joseph Cohen, the market strategist at Goldman, Sachs,\nsaid, ``If you have been an investor paying attention, there was no\nmajor news this week and the response",

As an\nimmediate result, more people live in poverty.\n\n\nAccording to local media reports, about one third of the\npopulation in Pakistan still live under the poverty line, and the\ncountry's child laborers are numbered at about eight million.\n\n\nAs an active way to save children from hard labor and send them\nback to school, the Pakistani government has mapped out a strategy\nto develop primary education countrywide, especially in rural and\nunder-developed urban areas.\n\n\nTo help raise the national education level, Prime Minister\nBenazir Bhutto has promised to make it a law that 3 percent of the\nGNP be allocated to the education sector annually.\n\n\nMeanwhile, the government is taking every possible steps to\ncontrol the country's population, and elaborate arrangements are\nbeing made in this regard under the eighth five-year plan.\n\n\nOfficial statistics show that there are 45,000 villages in\nPakistan with a total population of 85 million. More than 13,060\nof these villages have a population of 2,000 each.\n\n\nUnder the government plan, in every such village, an educated\nmarried woman, who belongs to the village concerned, will be\nselected and employed on contract basis to spread the message of\nfamily planning.\n\n\nMoreover, to provide more educational facilities and\nopportunities to school-age children, a number of laws and other\nrelated measures have been adopted by the government and\nnon-governmental organizations.\n\n\nAs an initial step, children under the age of 14 are not\nallowed to work in high intensity, poisonous or dangerous\nindustries, such as carpet-weaving, cement, explosive\nmanufacturing, dyeing, construction and transportation.\n\n\nConcerned laws also provide detailed regulations on the timing,\nsafety and health standards for adolescent workers and increased\npenalties for those breaking the laws.\n\n\nIn the past year alone, the government conducted nearly 3,000\ninspections, resulting in prosecutions in about 1,000 cases.\n\n\nMeanwhile, several government organizations, such as the\nNational Committee on the Rights of the Child, the Pakistan\nCommission, have been set up to take care of children's rights,\nwelfare and development.\n\n\nSome non-governmental organizations, with the help of the\ngovernment, have planned to set up 35 rehabilitation centers for\nchildren in areas where child labor are concentrated.\n\n\nThese centers will be responsible for imparting primary\neducation and vocational training to the children.\n\n\nHowever, to eliminate child labor is not the work of a single\nday. Observers here believe that despite all these efforts, the\nPakistani government is still facing a Herculean task in this\nregard.\n\n\nMore efforts are needed to develop economy, control population\ngrowth and spread education for an eventual solution of the\nproblem.",

It is currently 6 billion.\n\n\n   Despite objections towards these and certain other\nrecommendations from a small group of conservative Muslim and Roman\nCatholic countries, backed by the Vatican, the conference adopted\nthem by consensus as part of a new action plan approved Friday for\nreaching the Cairo population goals. Argentina, Nicaragua and the\nVatican filed reservations.\n\n\n   Population officials generally expressed satisfaction with the\nmeeting's outcome. ``Cairo has taken root and is working'' the\nchief U.S. delegate, Undersecretary of State Frank Loy, said at a\nclosing press conference Friday.\n\n\n   Rather than merely setting numerical targets and mounting\nfamily-planning campaigns, the Cairo strategy for limiting\npopulation growth seeks to improve the status of women in the\nbelief that they will then have smaller families.\n\n\n   This week's conference recommended that governments make a\nnumber of adjustments to this strategy mainly in the way they treat\nabortion, the 1.1 billion people in the world between the ages of\n15 and 24 and the estimated 33 million people infected with the\nAIDS virus.\n\n\n   It urged governments to deal resolutely with the damage done to\nwomen by unskilled abortionists, saying that where this practice is\nlegal they should ``train and equip health-service providers and\nshould take other measures to insure that abortion is safe and\naccessible.''\n\n\n   While Chile and El Salvador are the only countries to ban\nabortion outright, another 75 or so only permit it only when a\nwoman's life is directly threatened.\n\n\n   The 1994 Cairo action plan called simply for abortion to be\n``safe'' in countries where it is legal. It did not say abortions\nshould be ``accessible'' or make governments responsible for\ninsuring practitioners are qualified.\n\n\n   Almost equally contentious, however, were the conference's\nrecommendations dealing with young people. It called for school\nchildren, at all levels, to be instructed in ``sexual and\nreproductive health issues'' in order to teach them ``responsible\nsexual behavior'' and protect them from ``unwanted pregnancy'' and\nsexually transmitted diseases.\n\n\n   It also told governments to provide ``special family-planning\ninformation, counseling and health services'' for ``sexually active\nadolescents'' and to help them avoid AIDS.\n\n\n   While governments should respect ``the rights, duties and\nresponsibilities of parents'' as well as ``cultural values and\nreligious beliefs,'' the conference said they should ``safeguard\nthe right of adolescents to privacy, confidentiality and informed\nconsent'' when providing such assistance.\n\n\n   These new recommendations go far beyond those of Cairo, which\nsimply asked governments to provide adolescents with ``guidance in\nsexual and reproductive matters'' and not to restrict their access\nto ``appropriate services and the advice they need.''\n\n\n   Once again, conservative governments sought to emphasize\nparents' right to control all aspects of their children's education\nand to play down the state's role in making sex education and\ncontraceptive advice available to young people.\n\n\n   The conference also recognized that the AIDS pandemic is far\nworse now than expected five years ago by setting new, specific\ntargets for reducing the infection's spread.\n\n\n   By 2005, it said, governments should insure that at least 90\npercent of adolescents have access to ``the information, education\nand services n",

To sustain and accelerate progress, donor nations\nshould double their assistance for family planning and related\nhealth care from the present total of 500 million dollars, to at\nleast one billion dollars by the year 2000, according to the report\nby Population Action International (PAI).\n\t   The 82-page report, Population Challenge,' argues that the\nregion's prospects for economic development largely depend on the\nsuccess governments can achieve in reducing the birth rate and\nproviding better health care to mothers and children. 'Africa is a\nlatecomer to the revolution in reproductive behaviour sweeping\nacross the developing world, but is now poised for positive change\nwith respect to childbearing patterns and sexual health,'' says\nShanti Conly, co-author of the study.

As a result, Africans' per capita income is about\n22 percent below what it was in 1975. According to the report,\nhowever, African governments increasingly have taken steps to\naddress these problems. About two- thirds of the countries in the\nregion now have active family-planning programmes. A fundamental\nshift in people's attitudes toward child-bearing has become\nincreasingly evident, the report says. This shift is explained in\npart by increasing economic hardship for poor families who, given\ngovernment budget cuts, find it more difficult to afford the costs\nof educating more children.",

Such action was needed to reduce poverty and hunger and\nto protect the earth's natural resources.\n\n\nSince alarm bells sounded some 30 years ago about the dangers\nof an overcrowded planet, world leaders have initiated a panoply\nof programmes to slow the population explosion.\n\n\nBut it will take at least another 50 years before the world's\npopulation, now at 5.9 billion, will begin to stabilize at 8.9\nbillion people, bringing monumental problems for poor nations in\nthe interim, according to U.N. experts planning a forum next week\nin The Hague, Netherlands.\n\n\nAlternatively, if programmes falter and money to finance them\nremains scarce, the world could have 10.7 billion people by 2050.\n\n\n\"In short, the planet seems to have averted -- at least for now\n-- the threat of a population bomb. The danger now is that we will\ndeclare victory and go home,\" says the U.N. Population Fund\n(UNFPA).\n\n\nHowever, direct U.S. funding to countries for family planning\nprogrammes was 540 million U.S. dollars in 1995, before being\nslashed by the U.S. Congress to its present level of 385 million\nU.S. dollars, about a third of the goal.\n\n\nBut Nafis Sadik, the Pakistani physician who heads UNFPA, noted\nthat Washington was not alone in failing to meet targets promised\nin Cairo, where nations agreed to increase spending on population\nprogrammes and related projects to 17 billion U.S. dollars by 2000\nand 22 billion U.S. dollars by 2015.\n\n\nOne third was to come from rich nations and in 1995 industrial\nstates met their targets. But since then most have reduced support\nfor population measures except for Denmark, Finland, Sweden,\nNorway and the Netherlands.",

Her birth was greeted with both fanfare and concern over\nthe nation's escalating growth rate.\n\n\n   Astha -- ''faith'' in Hindi -- was born to Anjana and Ashok Arora\nat 5:05 a.m. Thursday, making India only the second nation after\nChina to exceed a billion people.\n\n\n   With an estimated 42,000 births per day in India, it was\nimpossible to know exactly where the billionth baby would be born,\nbut the government staged the milestone as part of a public\ncampaign to encourage Indians to have smaller families.\n\n\n   Astha, wailing, was wheeled out with her sari-clad mother just\nnine hours after she was born to face a crowd of government\nministers and a horde of journalists at Safdarjang Hospital in the\nIndian capital. She weighed six pounds 13 ounces, doctors said.\n\n\n   ''I feel fine,'' said the mother, Anjana, weak and overwhelmed\nby the chaotic reception. ''I'm happy,'' said Ashok Arora, who\nworks in an automotive spare parts shop for a salary of $50 per\nmonth.\n\n\n   ''Don't crush the baby,'' Sumitra Mahajan, the minister for\nwomen and child welfare, screamed into her microphone as nearly 200\njournalists swarmed over the mother's bed. Hospital guards climbed\nonto a nearby bed and beat back the journalists with wooden\ntruncheons.\n\n\n   Every measure of progress India has made since independence in\n1947 has been swamped by the swelling population: Food production\nhas tripled, yet many people go hungry; literacy has increased, but\nso has the overall number of illiterate people.\n\n\n   The government picked May 11 as the date -- calling it ''a moment\nof celebration, a moment to ponder.'' Health Ministry officials,\nwith the concurrence of the U.N. Population Fund, decreed that a\nbaby girl born this morning in the 1,500-bed Safdarjang Hospital\nwould symbolically mark the milestone. Twenty-four babies were born\nin Safdarjang between midnight and noon.\n\n\n   The choice of a baby girl reflects another part of the\ngovernment's attempts to change Indians' family attitudes:\npromoting fair treatment for infant girls to overcome traditional\nbiases in favor of boys.\n\n\n   The last national census in 1991 said there were 927 women for\nevery 1,000 men in India.

      "content": "&HT;   \n\n\n\n   ATLANTA _ For two decades, Cobb and Gwinnett counties have\nproduced record growth for metro Atlanta's north side, as sewers\nand highways stretched into empty land, causing houses and\nbusinesses to multiply like weeds. Now forecasts show the boom will\ncontinue, putting the two counties among the hottest in the nation\nwell into the next century.\n\n\n   Gwinnett will add 526,550 people by the year 2025, according to\nWashington, D.C.-based NPA Data Services. That ranks it 19th among\nall U.S. counties in projected population increase. That would put\nGwinnett at 1.02 million residents.\n\n\n   NPA, a private company which compiles economic statistics and\nforecasts for academics and businesses, predicts Cobb will add just\nmore than half a million people in the next two and a half decades.\nThat gives it a spot at No. 21 and a potential population of more\nthan 1.5 million. Most other counties topping the growth chart were\nin Arizona, California and Texas.\n\n\n   Job growth on the Northside also could be hot. NPA ranks\nGwinnett 19th, with the creation of 467,240 jobs by 2025, and Cobb\nis projected to add 453,200 jobs. That ranks it 23rd.\n\n\n   ``It's shocking to see when you put it down on paper, but based\non what's happened here in the past 25 years, it certainly doesn't\nseem unrealistic,'' said Richard Tucker, Gwinnett Chamber of\nCommerce president.\n\n\n   ``The whole picture has changed,'' says Don Beaver, in charge of\neconomic development for Cobb's chamber. ``Cobb County 15 years ago\nwas a bedroom community, and now it's a destination point.''\n\n\n   But to motorists who jam I-75 every rush hour and commuters\ncrawling along I-85, the first question must be: where in the world\nwill it all go? How can counties in the middle of a debate about\nthe region's sprawling development and air quality, a debate that\nhas reached the Legislature this year, be able to accommodate all\nthis new growth?\n\n\n   Maybe they won't have to. Many business people and\nenvironmentalists in both counties, who often are on opposite sides\nof the growth debate, say the predictions probably won't happen.\nToo many hurdles are in the way, including a ban on federal money\nfor road building and increasing resistance to sprawl from both\nresidents and officials.\n\n\n   Others, though, are more optimistic, pointing to the immense\ngrowth that has occurred in the two counties during the past few\ndecades. Once-rural places and crossroads now have malls and strip\nshopping centers, tangles of subdivisions and busy streets. The\nentire Northside has been booming, including most areas of north\nFulton.\n\n\n   Gwinnett's population has nearly tripled since 1980. During that\ndecade it was named the fastest growing county in the country.\nCobb's has nearly doubled since then. A few decades ago, Gwinnett\nhad a job base for only 20 percent of its residents, meaning most\neverybody else drove downtown or to other areas to work. Today,\nabout 60 percent of the county's work force also lives there.\n\n\n   So, rural became suburban. And now, suburban is evolving into\nurban.\n\n\n   ``We are turning into a city,'' said Gwinnett Chairman Wayne\nHill. ``We'll always be a part of the Atlanta region, but Gwinnett\nCounty is going to become a major player in the state. I don't see\nany reason it won't, and that means it will keep growing. ... As\nlong as we maintain good schools and good environment, people will\nwant to come here.''\n\n\n   But of course, therein lies the problem as well as the promise.\nIf Cobb and Gwinnett cannot retain the qualities that attract\nnewcomers, it might cause all the growth forecasts to fizzle.\n\n\n   ``At some point, they hit limits,'' says Donald Ratajczak, chief\neconomic forecaster at Georgia State University. He believes none\nof the suburban counties are planning well enough to accommodate\nall the predicted growth.\n\n\n   ``DeKalb ran out of residential space, and it will happen\nprobably to Cobb before Gwinnett,'' he said. ``I'm not saying\nthings are dire for them, I'm just saying that the past 20 years\ncan't be replicated in the next 20 years.''\n\n\n   Scott Dorfman has see",

Substantial rain hasn't fallen for weeks.\n\n\n   Still, computer programmer Robert Bonham doesn't worry about\nrunning out of water. His grass might turn brown, but that's more a\nnuisance than a crisis.\n\n\n   ``The expectation is that I pay for water like I pay for cable.\nI expect it to work,'' Bonham said. ``I won't think about it unless\nwe get to a point where there's so much growth the city can't\ndeliver it.''\n\n\n   It's almost reached that point in Cary and other fast-growing\nareas of the Deep South _ not just because of an early season\ndrought but also because of a decade of intense growth and\ndevelopment. Booming counties and towns haven't built treatment\nplants or laid pipes fast enough to keep up with surging Southern\npopulations.\n\n\n   From 1990 to 1998, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and Virginia\nranked in the Top 10 for people moving within their boundaries.\nDuring that same period, the Top 10 fastest-growing counties in the\ncountry included five from the Deep South _ four in Georgia and one\nin Virginia.\n\n\n   ``From a planning perspective, water is an absolute necessity,''\nsaid Michael Vasu, a professor of public administration and\npolitical science at North Carolina State University. ``There are\nsome parts of the infrastructure that you can let deteriorate to\nsome extent, like roads. But when there's a lack of water, you need\nan immediate solution.''\n\n\n   Despite a smattering of weekend rain, communities throughout the\nSouth are restricting outdoor water use. Drought conditions exist\nfrom south Alabama to northern Virginia.\n\n\n   Even before the mercury hit the century mark in Cary, the town\ncouncil stopped accepting building applications so the community on\nthe edge of Research Triangle Park could figure out where to get\nmore water. Since 1988, Cary's population has more than doubled to\nnearly 90,000 people.\n\n\n   Politics designed to curb growth delayed construction of a new\nwater treatment plant, which may not be operating till 2003 or\nlater. The city currently buys 40 percent of its water supply from\nRaleigh and Durham.\n\n\n   A recent heat wave that pushed temperatures at the\nRaleigh-Durham airport to 100 degrees for the first time in four\nyears has prevented municipal neighbors from sharing with Cary.\n\n\n   ``There's no question that the ability to share our water\nresources is a factor in future development, whether it's\nresidential or business,'' Vasu said. ``South Carolina is starting\nto feel some of that but certainly North Carolina and Georgia are\nat the forefront of all that.''\n\n\n   In Columbia, S.C., where growth has been modest but steady,\nRichland County Land Development Administrator Ken Knudsen has\nabsorbed water woes like everyone else.\n\n\n   ``My water pressure is low, but whose isn't?'' he said.\n\n\n   Since January, less than 10 inches of rain has fallen in\nColumbia _ 6 inches less than the average for the year.\n\n\n   Selling water is an industry for Columbia. It buys water from an\narea electric utility then resells it to other governments. In\n1998, Columbia earned more than $50 million in revenue from water\nsales.\n\n\n   But the deal is about to get more expensive. The utility claims\nwater diverted from its hydroelectric plants are undervalued and it\nmay increase its charges to Columbia and others by as much as 10\ntimes current cost.\n\n\n   In Georgia, severe or extreme drought conditions grip most of\nthe state. Several metro Atlanta areas already have imposed outdoor\nwatering restrictions _ including suburban boom counties like Henry\nand Cherokee. Fescue lawns will go unwatered. Chevy pickups will go\nunwashed. The reason: Demand exceeds delivery capability.\n\n\n   ``That's the issue,'' said Pat Stevens, chief of environmental\nplanning for the Atlanta Regional Commission. ``I've been around\nfor 20 years and that's the issue. When you have that kind of\ngrowth, the infrastructure doesn't keep up. There are restrictions\nin Henry County but not in the city of Atlanta.''\n\n\n   The hot, dry summer has put its traditional",

And it is important to\ntighten control over bank credit, and ensure good harvests to help\ncontrol inflation, said the professor.\n\n\nMoreover, Yang praised the successful \"soft landing\" after high\ninflation in 1993-95, and the increasing foreign exchange reserve,\nfrom 19.4 billion U.S. dollars in 1992 to 105 billion U.S. dollars\nby the end of 1996.",

The spring water is\nalways clear and tranquil.\n\n\nBut the water level of the famed natural spring has gradually\ndropped in the past 100 years due to population growth and the\nloss of underground water.\n\n\nAccording to monitoring data, the spring's water level had gone\ndown nine meters by 1998. The speed of descent accelerated from a\ndozen centimeters a year in recent years to the present 40 cm. Now,\nthe area of the spring has shrunk by half, down to 5,000 square\nmeters.\n\n\nScholars in many countries worry about the phenomena and fear\nthat this unusual bit of scenery will disappear from the desert,\nand threaten the safety of the world-renowned Mogao Grottoes, said\nWang Xudong, a cultural relics expert with the Dunhuang Research\nInstitute.\n\n\nThe Chinese government started rescue measures for the spring\nas early as 1976, Wang said. In April of this year, the Lanzhou\nHydrological Center started a project to replenish underground\nwater feeding the spring.\n\n\nAs a result, an estimated 1,000 tons of water have seeped into\nthe spring each day, curbing the rapid drop of the water level.\nHydrogeologists are searching for ways to balance the rise in the\nlake water and the seepage of underground water and how to control\nthe loss of underground water.\n\n\n\"If the problem is solved once and for all, it will give us a\nframe of reference for desert improvement and will aid the\nprotection of the Mogao Grottoes,\" Wang said.",

A slower growth rate of 2.6\npercent is expected in 2001, followed by a rate of 2.5 percent in\n2002.\n\n\n   ``This year will be the best year in the last decade,'' said Tom\nLieser, executive director of the Anderson Business Forecast. ``We\nwill also probably turn the corner and see a moderation of these\ngrowth numbers later this year.''\n\n\n   There was a large interest rate hike last month, but it doesn't\nappear that it has done damage to the California economy, he said.\n\n\n   At its May 16 meeting, the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee\nraised the federal funds rate 50 basis points to 6.5 percent. Over\nthe last year the Fed has raised short-term interest rates by 1.75\npercentage points in an effort to curb inflation at a time of rapid\neconomic growth.\n\n\n   ``What the figures (in this report) show is that we are going to\nhave a good year in 2000, much better than anyone expected,'' said\nJack Kyser, chief economist with the Los Angeles County Economic\nDevelopment Corp.\n\n\n   ``It looks like a good solid economy but there are risks,'' he\nsaid.\n\n\n   Kyser said one of the risks is another interest rate hike when\nthe Federal Reserve meets next week in Washington.\n\n\n   Interest rate hike or not, the latest data on regional\nemployment trends show that Central California is leading the state\nin both nonfarm employment growth and unemployment.\n\n\n   Employment growth in the 10-county area was up 3.4 percent\nthrough May from a year ago, compared with 3.0 percent for the\nseven counties in Southern California and 2.8 percent for the\ncounties of the San Francisco Bay and Sacramento areas combined.\n\n\n   With the exception of the Stockton-Lodi area, Central California\ncontinues to experience double-digit rates of unemployment.\nUnemployment rates are highest in Fresno County, 13.5 percent, and\nMerced County, 13.4 percent, the report said.\n\n\n   The high unemployment figures reflect the fact that Central\nCalifornia's economy is based on agriculture, said Kyser.\n\n\n   In Southern California, inland Riverside and San Bernardino\ncounties continued to lead in employment growth - an increase of\n5.5 percent through May.\n\n\n   ``They are making a transition from an agricultural to an\nurbanized ... economy,'' he said. ``A lot of manufacturing firms\nare moving from Los Angeles and Orange counties. Also, Palm Springs\nhas become a year-round economy, not one just based on tourism.''\n\n\n   Employment grew by 2.2 percent for the year to date in Los\nAngeles County, compared with 1.6 percent in 1999. In San Jose in\nSanta Clara County, it was up by 2.1 percent vs. 1.3 percent in\n1999.\n\n\n   The survey also forecasts permits in 2000 for 154,000 housing\nunits, declining slightly in 2001 to 151,000 before rebounding the\nnext year to 159,000.\n\n\n   With limited new housing coming to the market, prices continue\nto increase. For Los Angeles County, the average price of a home\nwas predicted to increase by 5.9 percent this year, according to\nthe survey.\n\n\n   While home prices continued to outpace construction, the survey\nalso found that consumer spending was expected to remain at record\nlevels before experiencing a slight slowdown in 2001 and 2002.\n\n\n   Consumer spending, as measured by taxable sales, will continue\nto reflect gains in personal income and employment in the coming\nyear. The exceptional impact from large amounts of wealth created\nin recent years should continue, the report said.\n\n\n   According to Lieser, California will enjoy a 7.8 percent\nincrease in taxable sales this year, which will be followed by\nslower gains of 6.3 percent in 2001 and 6.1 percent in 2002.\n\n\n   ``It is not just rich people doing this,'' said Lieser. ``In\norder for us to see such",

From 1986 through 1995, nearly 6.7\nmillion hectares (16.5 million acres) of farmland were lost to\ndisasters and development, according to a government report\nreleased Friday.\n\t   Lax enforcement of environmental laws and rampant deforestation\n_ leading to soil erosion and silting of riverbeds _ were a major\nfactor behind floods that killed more than 3,000 people this\nsummer, the government has acknowledged.\n\t   In response to the flooding, effective Sept. 1 the government\nbanned logging along the upper reaches of the Yangtze River.\n\t   Zhou refused to answer reporters' questions about how the\ncentral government would pay for the shift from logging to\nreforestation, estimated by Sichuan provincial officials to cost\nmore than 1 billion yuan (dlrs 120 million) annually, and prevent\nillegal logging.\n\t   The government also plans to take some land on steep hillsides\nor along rivers and lakes out of farming to help prevent floods.\n\t   Zhou admitted the process would be gradual, as farmers and\nloggers are moved from mountainsides to wasteland on the plains in\nSichuan to farm.\n\t   ``The process affects people's livelihoods, so we'll be adopting\na very cautious strategy,'' he said.\n\t   The worst flooding since 1954 on the Yangtze River laid bare the\ncost of China's choice of putting fast growth ahead of\nenvironmental protection.\n\t   Sedimentation has reduced the volume of China's huge freshwater\nlakes along the Yangtze _ which served as natural diversion tanks\nfor floodwaters _ by 40 percent, according to figures released\nFriday.\n\t   The land agency's report Friday was one of the first to use new\nestimates that show China has about 40 percent more farmland than\npreviously acknowledged. But even the higher number still leaves\nChina with a small amount of farmland compared to its population:\njust under 10 percent of the world's farmland for 22 percent of the\nworld's population.\n\t   According to the new data, China has 128 million hectares (316\nmillion acres) of farmland, or about 14 percent of its total land,\ncompared with the 93 million hectares (230 million acres) reported\nuntil recently but long known to be an underestimate.\n\t   The new figure was calculated using satellite photography. The\nold one was compiled from reports by local officials who tended\nunderreport land area to lower their tax bases or exaggerate\nproductivity.",

Foundation, set up to distribute Atlanta businessman\nTed Turner's $1 billion gift to U.N.-related causes, has made\npopulation control one of its main focuses.\n\n\n   The Carter Center is concentrating on food supply and ways to\nimprove health delivery systems in 25 countries.\n\n\n   And the relief agency CARE, an organization that had no family\nplanning program as recently as 1991, now helps offer birth control\nto 4 million people in 36 countries, said Maurice Middleberg, the\norganization's director of health and population programs.\n\n\n   ``Our goal, God willing, is that we will serve over the next\nfive years something on the order of 14 million,'' Middleberg said.\n\n\n   Fourteen million. Six billion. What do the numbers mean? To put\nit in perspective, consider that one-tenth of all the people who\nhave ever lived on planet Earth are alive today.\n\n\n   ``In 1800, the world's population reached 1 billion. By 1930, it\nwas 2 billion. Now, we're heading toward 6 billion,'' said Peter\nBahouth, executive director of the Turner Foundation. ``The world's\npopulation is increasing by 78 million people a year _ that's the\npopulation of Greece, Sweden and France combined.''\n\n\n   Since the time his boss Turner was born roughly 60 years ago,\nthe world has added 2 billion people, Bahouth said. ``That's\namazing. It's just an incredible statistic.''\n\n\n   Even though fertility rates are decreasing, the United Nations\nprojects a population of 9 billion by 2050. Bahouth said the growth\nrate will not stabilize for years because of what is known as\n``demographic momentum.''\n\n\n   ``There are already so many young people,'' he said.\n\n\n   Many of the 1 billion people ages 15 to 24 and the 2 billion\nunder age 15 are destined to become parents. That's why the Turner\nFoundation is focusing special attention on adolescents.\n\n\n   ``There is the largest ever group of adolescents that the world\nhas ever seen,'' said Ellen Marshall, program officer for\npopulation and women for the U.N. Foundation. ``Looking at what\n(adolescents') opportunities are and the decisions they make is\ngoing to have an enormous impact on their countries and the\nworld.''\n\n\n   In Georgia, for example, the Turner Foundation funds the Georgia\nCampaign for Adolescent Pregnancy and Prevention, which, Bahouth\nsaid, concentrates on providing good health care and opportunities\nfor youths without early pregnancy.\n\n\n   Such educational programs coupled with better access to\ncontraception are the only way to start curbing population growth,\nexperts say. But a variety of economic and cultural reasons hamper\naccess to birth control for women in developing nations.\n\n\n   Agencies like CARE, which has its U.S. headquarters in Atlanta,\nhave taken on the task of easing accessibility. In Ghana, for\nexample, CARE trains hairdressers on how to use condoms so that\nthey can show their customers.\n\n\n   ``(People) get their hair done, and while they're waiting, they\nalso pick up their contraceptives,'' said spokeswoman Cynthia\nGlocker.\n\n\n   Even where there is availability of birth control, bad\ninformation often abounds.\n\n\n   ``You talk to women, and they'll say things like: `Is the IUD\ngoing to float in my body? I've heard stories that it enters my\nlungs. Or the pill gives you cancer,''' said CARE's Middleberg.\n\n\n   A problem, say family planning workers, is that it takes a long\ntime to change perceptions and beliefs, and ultimately, ways of\nlife.\n\n\n   ``It takes years to see results,'' said Gordon Streeb, associate\nexecutive director of the Carter Center.",

Inserted into the uterus, it prevents pregnancies by\nscarring the fallopian tubes.\n\t   Quinacrine isn't approved by the U.S. Food and Drug\nAdministration for use in the United States because of the possible\ndangers, including a suggested link to cancer.\n\t   Nearly all major family-planning organizations, many foreign\ngovernments and the World Health Organization also oppose its use\nfor sterilization.\n\t   Sipharm Sisseln Vice President Fritz Schneiter said his company\nhad nothing to do with the actual use of the pellets. He also said\nit hadn't been warned by the WHO about the way the drug was being\nused.\n\t   Sipharm said it has produced around 2 million of the pellets for\nthe Center for Research on Population and Security and another\norganization in the United States, the International Federation for\nFamily Health. It has also produced one million pellets for the\nInternational Association for Maternal and Neonatal Health in\nSwitzerland.\n\t   The U.S. center is run by contraceptive researcher Stephen D.\nMumford, 55, of North Carolina, and his colleague, Dr. Elton\nKessel, 79, of Oregon.\n\t   They paid for the pellets' manufacture in Switzerland and\narrange for its free distribution in poor nations through a network\nof doctors, nurses and midwives. Mumford claims women in Asia\nprefer it to surgical sterilization and that it is cheap and safe.\n\t   Operating on a tiny budget out of Mumford's home, the two hope\nto use the drug to curb population growth and limit the flow of\nimmigrants to the United States.\n\t   Their primary goal, Mumford said, is to improve the lives and\nprotect the health of Third World women, almost 600,000 of whom die\neach year from pregnancy-related complications.",

      "content": "WILL HUMANS OVERWHELM THE EARTH? THE DEBATE GOES ON \n\n\n\n   PHILADELPHIA _ Two hundred years ago the Rev. Thomas Robert\nMalthus, an English economist and mathematician, anonymously\npublished an essay predicting that the world's burgeoning human\npopulation would overwhelm the earth's capacity to feed it.\n\n\n   Malthus' gloomy forecast, called ``An Essay on the Principle of\nPopulation As it Affects the Future Improvement of Society,'' was\ncondemned by Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels and many other theorists,\nand it was still striking sparks last week at a meeting in\nPhiladelphia of the American Anthropological Society. Despite\ncontinuing controversy, it was clear that Malthus' conjectures are\nfar from dead.\n\n\n   Among the scores of special conferences organized for the 5,000\nparticipating anthropologists, many touched directly or indirectly\non the dilemma suggested by Malthus: Although global food supplies\nincrease arithmetically, the population increases geometrically _ a\nvastly faster rate.\n\n\n   The consequence, Malthus believed, was that poverty, and the\nmisery it imposes, will inevitably increase unless the increase in\npopulation is curbed.\n\n\n   This contention has prompted endless debate. Malthus' critics\nhave argued that man's ingenuity will always keep pace with\npopulation growth by finding improved ways to produce food. They\ncite the success of the ``Green Revolution'' launched in the 1950s\nand 1960s by Dr. Norman Borlaug and his associates in developing\nhigh-yield strains of rice and wheat.\n\n\n   But the scientific descendants of Malthus argue that feeding the\nworld's masses is only part of the problem. Just as dangerous, they\ncontend, is the omnivorous consumption of nonrenewable resources,\nthe irreversible destruction of habitats and species, the fouling\nof the air and seas and consequent changes in climate, and many\nother effects of a growing human horde.\n\n\n   One of the symposiums held at last week's meeting was regarded\nas so contentious that a similar conference was banned from the\n1994 meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of\nScience, on the grounds _ said its organizer, Dr. Warren Hern, a\nColorado physician and epidemiologist _ that ``you may not ask that\nquestion.''\n\n\n   The question, posed as the title of the symposium, was this:\n``Is the Human Species a Cancer on the Planet?''\n\n\n   Hern, the director of an abortion clinic in Boulder, Colo.,\nnoticed nearly a decade ago that aerial and satellite views of\nurban centers taken over a period of years bore a striking\nsimilarity to images of cancerous tissue _ particularly melanoma _\ninvading the healthy surrounding tissue.\n\n\n   In his presentation last week, Hern argued that in many parts of\nthe world the increase in human numbers is rapid and uncontrolled,\nthat it invades and destroys habitats, and that by killing off many\nspecies it reduces the differentiation of nature. All of these\nfeatures are characteristic of cancerous tumors, he said.\n\n\n   This assessment was applauded by another member of the panel,\nDr. Lynn Margulis of the University of Massachusetts in Boston, who\nis the co-author of another highly debated theory, the Gaia\nHypothesis.\n\n\n   The hypothesis, the brainchild of an English theorist, Dr. James\nLovelock and Dr. Margulis, who is a microbiologist, is that the\nearth deploys feedback mechanisms to maintain an environment\nhospitable to life. In this it resembles a gigantic living\norganism, proponents of the Gaia idea believe.\n\n\n   Life on earth has survived many crises, including mass\nextinctions caused by the impacts of asteroids and comets, Dr.\nMargulis said, and life will continue despite the threats created\nby humanity _ but with reduced diversity.\n\n\n   She agreed with the notion that the human race is a kind of\nself-destructive cancer.\n\n\n   ``For millions of years,'' she said, ``the earth got along\nwithout human beings, and it will do so again. The only question is\nthe nature of the human demise that has already begun.''\n\n\n   Dr. Margulis quoted a line from the German philosopher Friedrich\nNietzsche: ``The earth is a beautiful",
