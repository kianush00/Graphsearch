      "content": "&HT;   \n\n\n\n   ORLANDO, Fla. _ Andrew was in living color.\n\n\n   The great storms from earlier this century are found only in\nfading snapshots, fading clippings, the fading memories of elderly\nsurvivors from a more sparsely developed Florida.\n\n\n   But if those storms were to strike today, they would hammer a\nFlorida of 15 million people, gleaming megalopolises and coastlines\npacked shoulder-to-shoulder with luxury high-rises.\n\n\n   Adjusting for how Florida has changed, those storms would do\ndamage on the order of Hurricane Andrew, an unnerving prospect for\nthe future, hurricane researcher Christopher W. Landsea told the\nNational Hurricane Conference on Friday.\n\n\n   Researchers studied the economic impact of the century's most\nferocious storms as if they had hit the United States today.\nAdjusting for inflation, growth and increased property values, they\nfound that seven of the 11 costliest storms and 13 of the top 30\nwere storms that hit Florida.\n\n\n   Topping the list: the great 1926 storm, which would cause an\nestimated $80 billion in damage today. It was almost as strong as\nAndrew and as big as Hugo. And unlike Andrew, which made landfall\nin Homestead, the 1926 hurricane hit downtown Miami head-on.\n\n\n   Andrew was second. It cost $26 billion when it hit in 1992. Just\nseven years later, its impact would be $36 billion, the study\nconcluded.\n\n\n   The 1928 hurricane, which drowned up to 3,000 in the Glades, was\nranked seventh, at $15 billion.\n\n\n   Meanwhile, Colorado State University hurricane soothsayer\nWilliam Gray on Wednesday updated his annual forecast by saying\nhe'll stick to his December prediction of 14 named storms _\ntropical storms or hurricanes _ with nine of those becoming\nhurricanes, and four becoming major hurricanes, with winds of more\nthan 111 mph. Gray never says where or whether storms will strike\nland, although he has said the odds of a hurricane hitting the U.S.\nEast Coast, including all of Florida, is three times above normal\nthis year.\n\n\n   Increasing awareness and preparation, better building codes and\nthe advent of mass communications have dropped hurricane deaths\nfrom thousands per year at the turn of the century to 100 a year\nnow, but property damages have risen sharply.\n\n\n   Despite that, people continue to migrate to America's coastline,\nespecially Florida's, Landsea told weather researchers and\nemergency managers.\n\n\n   Applying his formula to history, Landsea contended the United\nStates has a one-in-six chance of suffering a storm with more than\n$10 billion in damages, and every year, ``the stakes rise due to\ninexorable coastal population growth and development.''\n\n\n   Already about 110 million people _ nearly half of all Americans\n_ live in a 5-mile-wide coastal strip that accounts for only 10\npercent of the nation's mass. It's expected to rise to\nthree-fourths of Americans during the 21st century.\n\n\n   More people live in Miami-Dade and Broward counties, according\nto the 1990 census, than lived in all 109 coastal counties from\nTexas to Virginia in 1930, he said.\n\n\n   Major hurricanes make up only one-fifth of all tropical storms\nbut account for 85 percent of the damage. And while peninsular\nFlorida experienced seven major hurricanes from 1944 to 1950 and\nonly three since, it is the increasingly-valuable property in their\npath that will mean more costly storms in the future, Landsea said.\n\n\n   ``We are causing hurricane disasters,'' he said. ``It is only a\nmatter of time before the nation experiences a $50 billion or\ngreater storm, with multibillion-dollar losses becoming more\nfrequent.''\n\n\n   Landsea, a hurricane researcher at the South Florida-based\nHurricane Research Division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric\nAdministration, parent of the National Weather Service and the\nNational Hurricane Center, conducted his research with Roger A.\nPielke Jr. of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in\nBoulder, Colo.\n\n\n   Story Filed By Cox Newspapers\n\n\n   For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service",

A Category 3 storm has winds of\nat least 111 miles per hour. This year's hurricanes claimed 76\nlives, and cost about $4.3 billion in damages.\n\n\n   Last year, also an active hurricane season, there were 14\ntropical storms, 10 of which became hurricanes, including three\nmajor hurricanes costing $7.3 billion.\n\n\n   Hurricane Floyd, which posed a serious threat to Florida and the\nCarolinas in September with winds up to 155 mph, killed 57 people\nand was the deadliest storm since Hurricane Agnes killed 122 people\nin 1972. Floyd ranked as the 20th deadliest U.S. hurricane in the\ncentury.\n\n\n   In October, Hurricane Irene battered Cuba and the Florida Keys\nwith winds of 110 mph and caused the indirect deaths of eight\npeople. Irene dumped torrential rains of up to 20 inches on Dade\nand Broward counties, causing urban flooding and $800 million in\ndamage.\n\n\n   ``Hurricanes Floyd and Irene are cruel reminders that hurricanes\ncan produce tragic loss of life and devastating economic\ndisruption,'' Baker said.\n\n\n   The best predictor of hurricanes is the impact of El Nino and La\nNina. El Nino is a disruption of ocean atmosphere systems in the\nPacific Ocean resulting in warmer waters in the Pacific Ocean,\nwhile La Nina produces colder waters in the Pacific Ocean. As the\ncolder waters of the Pacific Ocean shift, a change in the\natmospheric winds occurs that generates the formation of hurricanes\nin the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n\n   The annual average of hurricanes has increased over the past\nfive years, said Jerry Jarrell, director of the National Hurricane\nCenter. While officials have been largely successful in predicting\nhurricane tracks, they still lack the tools to forecast rapid\nchanges in a hurricane's intensity.\n\n\n   Inland flooding remains the leading cause of hurricane deaths\nand damages.

Still, its rains _ Boynton Beach alone experienced nearly\n16 inches in two days _ brought flooding that took days to\ndissipate. Winds and flooding caused at least $200 million in\ninsured damages.\n\n\n   Irene killed seven people in South Florida, all in Broward\nCounty. A mother, her two sons and a neighbor boy were electrocuted\nin Weston in calf-deep water when they stepped into a puddle\ncontaining a downed power line while walking their dog during a\nlull in the storm. A 13-year-old Cooper City boy died when he\ngrabbed a downed power line as he waded through 18 inches of water\nduring the storm. And two people drowned after driving into canals\nnext to flooded roads.\n\n\n   ``Irene is a reminder that October is a busy month,'' National\nHurricane Center forecaster Richard Pasch said last week. ``Florida\ngets a lot of hurricane hits in October; we saw it frequently in\nthe 1930s and 1940s. That's a reality check.''\n\n\n   Floyd was larger than life as it bore down on the Florida\npeninsula Sept. 12, with top sustained winds of 155 _ about the\nsame strength as Andrew. Florida's salvation was a giant trough\nthat forecasters said would begin steering Floyd away from shore\nabout 24 hours ahead of projected landfall, which at the time\nlooked more and more like downtown West Palm Beach. The storm did\nturn on time that night, but not before nerve-wracked residents\nboarded up and chewed fingernails. Procrastinators fighting for\nplywood caused turmoil at home improvement stores.\n\n\n   Floyd later straddled the coast through the Carolinas to New\nEngland, bringing catastrophic flooding to North Carolina and New\nJersey and killing at least 69 people _ the largest U.S. loss of\nlife since Agnes in 1972. Early damage estimates were at least $3\nbillion.\n\n\n   Another storm, Dennis, had come ashore in the Carolinas on Aug.\n30 and gone out to sea, but returned and savaged the North Carolina\ncoast for a week, bringing heavy rains, gale force winds and\nflooding. Seven people died.\n\n\n   As is often the case, the deadliest storm wasn't the strongest\nor the wettest. It wasn't even a tropical storm. A tropical\ndepression formed off Mexico's Yucatan peninsula Oct. 4 and came\nashore northeast of the coastal resort of Veracruz; that weather\nsystem and another one next to it brought torrential rains that\ncaused flooding and mud slides that may have killed as many as 400.\n\n\n   Just as people were starting to take down their shutters, Lenny\nsprang to life in mid-November, racing from the Gulf of Mexico east\nthrough the Caribbean. It killed 13 people in the Virgin and\nLeeward Islands before fizzling on Sunday, only nine days before\nthe official end of hurricane season.\n\n\n   Story Filed By Cox Newspapers\n\n\n   For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service",

      "content": "Hurricane Georges reaches Cuba; Florida Keys evacuation under way\n\n\n\t   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Hurricane Georges reached Cuba and\nthreatened the Florida Keys Wednesday after making a shambles of\nmuch of Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic and Haiti in a furious\nmarch that killed at least 50 people and probably many more.\n\t   In Florida, up to 100,000 people were ordered to begin\nevacuating the exposed Florida Keys, and cars, trucks and sport\nutility vehicles streamed along the highway linking the island\nchain to the Florida mainland.\n\t   South Florida was put under a hurricane watch and Gov. Lawton\nChiles declared a state of emergency in central and southern\nFlorida, allowing the state to use the National Guard, lift tolls\nalong evacuation routes and purchase emergency supplies.\n\t   The Cayman Islands issued tropical storm warnings for Little\nCayman and Cayman Brac.\n\t   The hurricane first hit the small islands of the northeast\nCaribbean early Monday, killing three in St. Kitts _ where the\ngovernment estimated damage at dlrs 445 million _ and two in\nAntigua.\n\t   The U.S. Virgin Islands, which were badly battered in recent\nhurricanes, suffered some damage to homes, tourist facilities and\nutilities; on the island of St. Croix, a looter shot and killed a\nman while burglarizing his home.\n\t   The effects of the storm were expected to be felt as far south\nas Jamaica, where officials expected heavy rains.\n\t   Three people were killed directly by the storm in Puerto Rico,\nwhere the government's insurance commissioner, Juan Garcia,\nestimated damages at dlrs 1 billion. Another eight, most of them\nelderly, died of heart attacks or asthma complications during the\nstorm.\n\t   On Wednesday reconstruction efforts were under way in\ncommunities like Loiza, where many homes of wood and zinc roofs\nwere crushed and washed away.\n\t   ``My sister's house is all gone. And that used to be my uncle's\nhouse,'' said Luis Manso, pointing to a nearby pile of wood debris\nas he struggled to repair his own shattered fruit and vegetable\nstand ``quickly, before the thieves come.''\n\t   The Federal Emergency Management Agency reported that about a\nthird of Puerto Rico's power was expected back Wednesday, but\n715,000 remained without running water. FEMA said airport damage\nwas minimal and the port of San Juan reported no major damage.\nCoffee and plantain crops, however, were badly harmed, FEMA said.\n\t   Seventeen were officially reported killed in the Dominican\nRepublic, which Georges hit Tuesday. However, the actual toll\nappears to have been much higher.\n\t   Reporters said that in San Cristobal, which is 20 miles (30\nkilometers) east of Santo Domingo, the Nizao river overflowed and\nknocked down a part of a school used as a shelter, killing five,\nand 31 were missing. Unconfirmed media reports put the death toll\nmuch higher, and officials planned a news conference on the\nsituation later Wednesday.\n\t   In the shanty neighborhood of La Cienega, the swollen river\ninvaded thousands of homes, covering some up to the roofs in fetid\nwater. Residents swam to their houses to try to retrieve their\nbelongings, some using empty water jugs tied to their arms to help\nthem float.\n\t   Earlier, looters in Santo Domingo waded waist-deep in water,\nbalancing televisions and air conditioners on their heads as 110\nmph (180 kph) winds toppled trees and crushed houses. Bands of\nyouths with machetes and pistols roamed the streets, many of them\ndrunk. Two of the dead were looters shot by police enforcing a\ncurfew.\n\t   From the Dominican Republic Georges proceeded Tuesday night to\nHaiti, occupying the western third of the island of Hispaniola.\n\t   In the poorest country in the Western hemisphere, Georges\nunleashed flash floods and killed at least 17.\n\t   Yolaine Surena of the civil defense authority said the\ngovernment could spare only dlrs 130,000 in emergency aid.\n\t   Most of the deaths reportedly occurred when floodwaters\ncollapsed two homes in the capital, Port-au-Prince, where there\nwere no public shelters.

Tourism worth\nbillions of dollars drives coastal economies from Key West to Nags\nHead, N.C., and for the past two years beach towns have been riding\na lucky streak.\n\n\n   During 1997 and so far this summer, the East Coast has been\nspared from hurricanes, but even with Alex's breakup, forecasters\nwere predicting trouble for the east coast. Following the remnants\nof Alex was a large tropical wave about midway between the Lesser\nAntilles and the Cape Verde islands Sunday that could brew into a\nstorm. Weather watchers also have warned of the potential for\ngreater hurricane activity from the emerging La Nina, the weather\ncounter-balance to spring's troublesome El Nino.\n\n\n   It is unusual for the African tropics to spawn storms such as\nAlex this early in the hurricane season, forecasters say. But when\nthey do, they typically signal that the remainder of the season\nwill be active, as was the case two summers ago when North Carolina\nsuffered the one-two punch of hurricanes Bertha and Fran.\n\n\n   Bertha hit on July 12, 1996, softening up the coastal defenses\nfor the Sept. 5 assault by Fran, North Carolina's most costly\nnatural disaster with damages of an estimated $6.5 billion and 22\ndeaths. The destruction reached as far inland as Raleigh, but was\nmost punishing on Topsail Island, a narrow spit northeast of\nWilmington.\n\n\n   Federal aid to North Carolina in disaster-assistance grants,\nloans and payments was an estimated $1 billion.\n\n\n   The beaches southwest of Wilmington escaped with relatively\nlittle damage. On Holden Beach, estimated damages of $200,000\nincluded houses that lost shingles, siding and a small number of\ndecks. Even so, people who've watched nor'easterns and other\nunnamed storms eat away at these beaches say southeastern North\nCarolina's coastline is poorly prepared for a major assault.\n\n\n   Back in 1954, Hurricane Hazel cut Holden Beach in two, and more\nthan four decades later, the newly constructed beachfront dune\nwouldn't stand a chance against a similar storm, experts said.\n\n\n   ``Before Fran and Bertha, the beaches were in bad shape,'' said\nBill Cleary, a geology professor at the University of North\nCarolina at Wilmington. ``They are even more vulnerable to storms\nbecause the beaches have not rebuilt as they were expected to\nrebuild.''\n\n\n   Cleary's studies at UNC-Wilmington's Center for Marine Science\nResearch have found that big storms push sand far off shore, rather\nthan deposit on the ocean floor just beyond the low-tide mark. The\nresult, he said, is narrow beaches that provide little resistance\nto the punishing tidal surges that accompany big storms.\n\n\n   Cleary called Holden Beach's dune a ``Band-aid approach that\nwould not last at all.''\n\n\n   Morgan, Holden Beach's manager,",

Workers also started \nleaving NASA's Kennedy Space Center, on a barrier island standing \nonly 9 feet above sea level. \n\n\n\t``I have never been this scared about a storm,'' said Bahamas  \nresident Angel Chea, manager of a graphics shop, as she boarded up \nher windows. \n\n\n\t``We need people to get ready right now, not tonight, not  \ntomorrow,'' said Joan Heller, a spokeswoman for Brevard County. \n\n\n\tBecause of uncertainty about the huge storm's path, a hurricane  \nwatch area on the mainland was expanded today, reaching all the way \nfrom the Miami area northward into Georgia, the U.S. National \nHurricane Center said in Miami. \n\n\n\t``It's capable of almost catastrophic destruction,'' said Todd  \nKimberlain, a forecaster at the hurricane center. \n\n\n\tFloyd had top sustained wind today of nearly 155 mph. That put  \nit on the verge of becoming a Category 5 storm, which features top \nsustained wind of more than 156 mph and is capable of causing \nextreme damage. By comparison, Hurricane Andrew had Category 4 \nstatus when it struck south Florida in 1992, killing 26 people and \ncausing an estimated $25 billion in damage. \n\n\n\tHowever, the hurricane center said little additional  \nstrengthening was likely by midday Tuesday. \n\n\n\tOnly two Category 5 hurricanes have struck the United States  \nsince record-keeping began, the Labor Day Hurricane of 1935, which \ndestroyed the railroad connecting the Florida Keys to the mainland \nand killed 423 people, and Camille in 1969, which killed 256 people \nalong the Gulf Coast and in Virginia. \n\n\n\tIf Floyd continued on a track toward central Florida, NASA  \nplanned to shut down the Kennedy Space Center by midnight tonight, \nleaving none of its 12,500 workers behind to ride out the storm. \nThe center is only 9 feet above sea level, so a storm surge as well \nas wind could be a problem. \n\n\n\tAll four space shuttles were in hangars, but four  \nmultimillion-dollar rockets were on launch pads and couldn't be \nmoved. \n\n\n\tAll of the northwest and central Bahamian islands were under  \nhurricane warnings today. A tropical storm warning was posted for \nthe southeastern Bahamas and the nearby British Turks and Caicos \nislands. \n\n\n\tA hurricane watch on the mainland was extended from the Miami  \narea northward all the way to near Brunswick, Ga. \n\n\n\tIn the middle of the watch area, Florida's Brevard County  \nordered tens of thousands of people living in mobile homes and \ncoastal areas to evacuate beginning at 4 p.m. today. \n\n\n\t``There are different tracks that have been projected and we  \ndon't come out unscathed on any of them,'' said Brevard County \nspokeswoman Joan Heller. \n\n\n\tAt 2 p.m., Floyd's center was about 90 miles east of San  \nSalvador in the central Bahamas, and about 470 miles east-southeast \nof Miami. It was headed west at nearly 15 mph, and was expected to \ngradually turn to a west-northwesterly-heading by evening, with a \nfurther turn toward the northwest on Tuesday. \n\n\n\tHurricane-force wind extended 105 miles from its center with  \ntropical storm-force wind stretching outward up to 290 miles. \n\n\n\tForecasters estimated storm surge conditions could reach 15 to  \n20 feet for the northwest Bahamas. \n\n\n\tFloyd grew unexpectedly into a monster of a storm on Sunday.  \n\n\n\t``I didn't expect such a very fast intensification,'' said Jerry  \nJarrell, director of the National Hurricane Center. ``This is a \nreal surprise for us.'' \n\n\n\tFar out at sea, Gert strengthened into a hurricane today with  \nsustained wind increasing to 75 mph.

Instead, the storm kept moving, causing sporadic flooding in\nLaredo but no serious damage there.\n\n\n   ``We dodged a major bullet,'' said Jerry Garza, a spokesman for\nthe city of Laredo. Garza said city officials had declared a state\nof emergency after the National Weather Service predicted up to 20\ninches of rain, which might have caused the creeks throughout the\ncity to overflow. ``The creeks filled up,'' Garza said, ``but it\nstopped raining.''\n\n\n   Designated Category 4, or extremely dangerous, because of its\n145 mile-per-hour winds, the storm veered away from heavily\npopulated Corpus Christi and came ashore on Sunday in Kenedy\nCounty, a rural expanse of pasture land with only 460 people. Once\nashore, the storm quickly weakened and was downgraded to a tropical\nstorm by Monday morning.\n\n\n   Mike Cox, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety,\nsaid officials had estimated that casualties could have been as\nhigh as 1,500 people if the storm had delivered a direct blow to\nCorpus Christi. Instead, it meandered westward from Kenedy County\nthrough areas with few, if any, people. The National Weather\nService estimated that the storm had dropped from 25 to 35 inches\nof rain in Kenedy County.\n\n\n   ``We were very lucky,'' said Brian LaMarre, a weather service\nmeteorologist. ``If it had landed in Corpus Christi or Houston or\nany populated area, it would have caused phenomenal damage. As it\nwas, it turned out to be a rainmaker.''\n\n\n   As thousands of evacuees continued to return home on Tuesday\nfrom inland shelters and hotels, utility workers all but restored\nelectricity in affected areas. The Texas Public Utility Commission\nreported that 3,000 people remained without power but predicted\nthat all power would be restored by Wednesday. Nearly 3,000 people\nremained without telephone service.\n\n\n   The fatal traffic accident in Laredo occurred on Monday\nafternoon as heavy rains from the storm deluged the city. Officials\nsaid that a tractor-trailer truck jackknifed on a rainy, windy\nhighway and smashed into a pickup truck. Three people in the pickup\nwere killed, as was the driver of the tractor-trailer.\n\n\n   ``That accident happened right when the really heavy part of\nTropical Storm Bret starting affecting Laredo,'' Garza said.",

The two-nation island is home to 15 million people,\nmany of whom live in substandard housing.\n\n\n   At least 13 deaths have been attributed to Georges during its\nsurge through the northern Caribbean. On Tuesday, the formidable\nstorm knocked out power and forced residents into shelters across\nthe densely populated Dominican Republic, where two people were\nkilled by downed electrical lines and a third by a collapsing wall.\n\n\n   The storm already had claimed at least 10 lives in the\nCaribbean, including five in Puerto Rico, where it left widespread\ndamage Monday.\n\n\n   Officials expected to issue a hurricane watch some time todayfor\nSouth Florida, where residents packed the stores in search of\nsupplies such as batteries, flashlights and water.\n\n\n   Georges was expected to weaken somewhat as it moved off the\nshore of Hispaniola, but not below hurricane strength. As of 5 p.m.\nEDT Tuesday, Georges had sustained winds of 110 mph.\n\n\n   Still, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center predicted\nthat Georges would pack much less of a punch than Hurricane Andrew,\nwhich caused billions of dollars in damage in densely populated\nSouth Florida in 1992.\n\n\n   On Tuesday, workers placed shutters over the windows at City\nHall in Key West, while authorities advised all visitors and\nnon-residents of the Florida Keys to evacuate the island chain,\nwhose only connection to the mainland is a two-lane highway.\n\n\n   ``We anticipate most of the evacuations will occur on\nWednesday,'' said Billy Wagner, an official with the Monroe County\nEmergency Management Service. ``Anyone who's got plans to visit the\nKeys should postpone them.''\n\n\n   In the Caribbean, Georges had paralyzed Santo Domingo, a city of\n3 million, by mid-afternoon, flooding streets, uprooting trees, and\nwhisking away tin roofs and satellite dishes.\n\n\n   Meanwhile, officials expected a high death toll in Haiti due to\nthe unsafe living conditions of thousands of desperately poor\nHaitians. In Haiti's capital of Port-au-Prince, which is surrounded\nby slums, fragile communities of cardboard homes cling to slippery\nhillsides.\n\n\n   ``People die here even when we just get a heavy downpour, one\nthat's not even a tropical storm, so this could be catastrophic for\nus,'' said Michelle Karshan, a spokeswoman for Haiti's President\nRene Preval.\n\n\n   When Tropical Storm Gordon, a much weaker system than Georges,\nstruck Haiti in 1994, hundreds of people were killed in mudslides.\n\n\n   Hurricane warnings were posted Tuesday for Haiti, eastern Cuba,\nthe southwestern Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos islands, and a\nhurricane watch was in effect in parts of Cuba and the Bahamas on\nTuesday.\n\n\n   On Monday and early Tuesday, Georges wreaked havoc across the\nnortheast Caribbean. With gusts of up to 130 mph, the hurricane\ndumped two feet of water in the mountains of Puerto Rico, while\nbending palm trees and flipping small aircraft like they were\npancakes.\n\n\n   On Tuesday, all of the U.S. territory's 3.8 million people were\nwithout power, and 80 percent of people were without running water,\nwhile more than 25,000 people sought refuge in shelters.\n\n\n   The airport in San Juan, Puerto Rico was able to operate Tuesday\nfor relief flights, but remained closed to other traffic.\n\n\n   ``We are starting from ground zero,'' Puerto Rico's Gov.

The National\nHurricane Center in Miami was expected to place parts of South\nFlorida under a hurricane watch late Tuesday.\n\n\n   Workers placed shutters over the windows at City Hall in Key\nWest, while authorities advised all visitors and non-residents of\nthe Florida Keys to evacuate the island chain who's only connection\nto the mainland is a two-lane highway.\n\n\n   ``We anticipate most of the evacuations will occur on\nWednesday,'' said Billy Wagner, an official with the Monroe County\nEmergency Management Service. ``Anyone who's got plans to visit the\nKeys should postpone them.''\n\n\n   Hurricane warnings were posted for Haiti, eastern Cuba, the\nsouthwestern Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos islands, and a\nhurricane watch was in effect in parts of Cuba and the Bahamas on\nTuesday.\n\n\n   Officials expected to issue a hurricane watch some time\nWednesday for South Florida, where residents packed the stores in\nsearch of supplies such as batteries, flashlights and water.\n\n\n   Georges was expected to weaken somewhat as it moved off the\nshore of Hispaniola, but not below hurricane strength. As of 5 p.m.\nEDT Tuesday, Georges had sustained winds of 110 mph.\n\n\n   Still, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center predicted\nthat Georges would pack much less of a punch than Hurricane Andrew,\nwhich caused billions of dollars in damage in densely populated\nSouth Florida in 1992.\n\n\n   On Monday and early Tuesday, Georges wreaked havoc across the\nnortheast Caribbean, killing at least 10 people, mostly due to\nmudslides and collapsed roofs.\n\n\n   Boasting gusts of up to 130 mph, the hurricane dumped two feet\nof water in the mountains of Puerto Rico, while bending palm trees\nand flipping small aircraft like they were pancakes.\n\n\n   On Tuesday, all of the U.S. territory's 3.8 million people were\nwithout power, and 80 percent of people were without running water,\nwhile more than 25,000 people sought refuge in shelters.\n\n\n   The airport in San Juan, Puerto Rico was able to operate Tuesday\nfor relief flights, but remained closed to other traffic.\n\n\n   ``We are starting from ground zero,'' Puerto Rico's Gov. Pedro\nRossello said of recovery efforts.\n\n\n   President Clinton declared Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin\nIslands disaster areas, authorizing immediate release of federal\nrecovery aid.

(AP) -- Hurricane Dennis weakened and slowed to a  \nnear halt today just off the coast, leaving relatively sparse \nproperty damage in its wake along the North Carolina seaboard. \n\n\n\t``All in all, we did dodge a bullet,'' Danny Couch, owner of a  \nshopping center in Buxton, said Monday evening. ``It was a pretty \nimpressive system.'' \n\n\n\tA hurricane warning along the North Carolina coast was  \ndowngraded to a tropical storm warning but forecasters said it was \ntoo early to write off Dennis completely. \n\n\n\tDennis, almost stationary this morning, could linger without  \nmoving much through Saturday, said Rod Gonski, forecaster at the \nNational Weather Service office in Raleigh. ``It likes that moist, \nwarm air on the Gulf Stream, and that's where it's centered now,'' \nhe said. \n\n\n\tIf it starts moving again, it's just as likely to head south or  \nsouthwest as it is to reverse course toward the Outer Banks or \nsoutheastern Virginia, Gonski said. \n\n\n\t``There's a chance it could come back, a little less than 50-50,  \nbut certainly worth talking about for sure,'' he said. ``There is \nnothing nudging it out in the ocean right now.'' \n\n\n\tBecause of the uncertainty about the storm, people have started  \ncalling oceanfront hotels in southeastern Virginia to cancel \nreservations for Labor Day weekend. \n\n\n\tDennis ``puts a lot of things into sort of a holding pattern,''  \nsaid Jimmy Capps, president of the Virginia Beach Hotel-Motel \nAssociation. ``What we probably need to do is give it another day \nand see where it's going to be.'' \n\n\n\tAt 11 a.m. today, Dennis was nearly stationary about 150 miles  \neast of Cape Hatteras, the National Hurricane Center said. Its \nmotion was expected to continue to be slow and erratic at least \ninto Wednesday morning. Its maximum sustained wind had slowed to \nabout 75 mph, barely above the minimum wind speed for a hurricane. \n\n\n\tIn addition to North Carolina, the tropical storm warning  \nstretched northward to Chincoteague, Va., and a gale warning \nextended from there to Great Egg Inlet, N.J. \n\n\n\tFor a time Monday, it seemed yet another hurricane might cross  \nCape Fear, directly south of Wilmington, just like Bertha and Fran \nin 1996 and Bonnie in 1998. Fran killed 25 people and caused up to \n$6 billion in damage. \n\n\n\tBut just as Dennis approached the Outer Banks, it began edging  \naway. \n\n\n\tThe storm's eye stayed 60 miles from shore, but it still  \npummeled the coast with high wind and up to 8 inches of rain. \n\n\n\tTwo people died Monday in Onslow County in a head-on car  \ncollision blamed on poor visibility from wind and rain. A surfer's \ndeath Saturday at St. Augustine Beach, Fla., was attributed to \nheavy surf from Dennis. \n\n\n\tIn Dare County, a Coast Guard helicopter rescued four men from a  \nsmall boat that was blown into a marsh after its engine failed in \nthe 30-foot surf. \n\n\n\tOn Hatteras Island, the ocean washed out Route 12, the only  \nhighway along the narrow barrier island. Part of the road was \nclosed near Kitty Hawk and up to 3 feet of sand covered the \nhighway. \n\n\n\tFarther south, the community of Cedar Island in Carteret County  \nwas cut off by high water, and Ocracoke Island was drenched by rain \nand waves. \n\n\n\t``The whole village was covered with water ... 6 feet above sea  \nlevel,'' Hyde County Manager Jeff Credle said of the town of \nOcracoke. \n\n\n\tDamage on Ocracoke Island can't be estimated until the water  \nrecedes, he said. \n\n\n\tCindy Babbitt rode out the storm in her Hatteras Landing Marina,  \njust across the inlet from Ocracoke. ``We're faring OK,'' she said. \n``I tried to look outside, but the rain is so sideways I can't \nsee.'' \n\n\n\tStorm damage was light. New Hanover's losses totaled $217,000,  \nwhile in Brunswick County, the collapse of a beachfront house at \nOcean Isle Beach was the worst property damage reported, said Cecil \nLogan of the county emergency management office. \n\n\n\tUtility companies said about 67,000 customers in coastal and  \ninland counties lost power.

Forecasters had expected it to hit\nonly the northern coast, but Georges, which killed at least 10\npeople in its furious march across the Caribbean, changed course\nand headed straight for the tropical capital of 3 million people.\n\t   Even more than in Puerto Rico, where Georges exploded shop and\ncar windows, flipped small airplanes and whisked away satellite\ndishes, the damage was expected to be extensive.\n\t   In this poor U.S. territory where the minimum wage is about dlrs\n140 a month, the wooden houses that line riverbeds and hillsides\nwould be no match for the storm's 110 mph (175 kph) winds.\n\t   In neighboring Haiti, which shares the island of Hispaniola and\nis also in the storm's path, people prepared to battle the\nhurricane amid even more profound poverty.\n\t   As the darkness approached, Dominican President Leonel Fernandez\ntold his countrymen the island's fate was in God's hands.\n\t   ``For the moment, the only thing left for us to do is to raise\nour prayers to the Almighty,'' said the president.\n\t   Hurricane warnings were in effect from the Dominican Republic to\neastern Cuba and the southeastern Bahamas. The U.S. National\nWeather Service said a hurricane watch may be needed late Tuesday\nor early Wednesday for the northwest Bahamas and South Florida.\n\t   David Chorney, a meteorologist at the National Hurricane Center\nin Miami, said there was ``a pretty good probability'' that Georges\nwould hit Florida.\n\t   ``As far as intensity, it's still too early to tell what it's\ngoing to do,'' he said. After crossing the Caribbean islands and\ngetting back over water, he said, ``there's a good chance it could\nredevelop and strengthen again.''\n\t   The storm had already caused what is expected to amount to\nhundreds of millions of dollars in damage in Puerto Rico, where the\nentire island lost power and most had their water cut. Five people\nwere killed on the island and tens of thousands took refuge in\nshelters.\n\t   In the capital of San Juan, where almost half the island's\npeople live, downed power lines and trees fell onto flooded roads,\nmaking some impassable.\n\t   On Tuesday, residents began the sobering task of recovery.\n\t   ``After the storm is always the worst,'' said Paula Aponte\nFigueroa, 71, as she swatted at mosquitoes in the musty heat, the\nroof of her house ripped off by the winds. ``There's flooding,\nthere are mosquitoes and I have nowhere to go.''\n\t   The strength of Georges' winds was evident as it ripped the roof\noff the cab of a water tanker truck passing through Santo Domingo,\nflipping it onto the hood of the vehicle. The driver continued on,\nhanging out the window to see where he was going.\n\t   Some people stood in whipping winds Tuesday morning trying to\nnail plywood boards over their windows. Many residents simply sat\nback and waited.\n\t   Authorities in Santo Domingo didn't open shelters until Tuesday\nmorning, hours after strong winds and heavy bursts of rain had\nreached the capital. People continued to stream into shelters even\nas the full force of Georges hit.\n\t   Power went out even before the full force of the hurricane hit.\nHotels evacuated tourists from their rooms overnight and put them\nup in conference rooms or ballrooms.\n\t   There was no word on casualties in the Dominican Republic. As\nGeorges moved into the east of Hispaniola, communication was cut\nbetween the capital and the east of the island.\n\t   Earlier, President Bill Clinton declared Puerto Rico",

The National Hurricane Center\nissued its first advisory Tuesday. When the center's plane visited\nthe storm early Friday, it discovered Floyd had grown to hurricane\nstrength.\n\n\n   Hurricane hunters plan to return to the storm today and the next\nthree days to gather information to be fed into the center's\ncomputer models that predict the storm's course, Mayfield said.\n\n\n   Forecasters are particularly troubled by a weather trough over\nthe southeastern United States that helped steer Hurricane Dennis\noffshore earlier this month.\n\n\n   ``Unfortunately, it's not going to remain there by the time\nFloyd gets up to the southeastern coast,'' Mayfield said. ``It will\ngradually lift to the northeast and what we're concerned about is\nthat a ridge of high pressure will build north of the hurricane. If\nthat does happen, it will allow a more west, northwest motion.''\n\n\n   Still, forecasters say another trough should move over the\ncentral United States during the next four days.\n\n\n   ``Depending on how far east it gets will determine in part what\nhappens to Floyd,'' Mayfield said.\n\n\n   During the day Friday, Floyd became better organized and even\nproduced an eye briefly in the afternoon, forecasters said. Because\nof its size, Lushine compared the storm to Hurricane Hugo, the 1989\nstorm that blasted Charleston, S.C., and caused $6 billion in\ndamages.\n\n\n   ``Hugo had winds that extended out 200 miles and hurricane winds\nout 100 miles whereas (1992's Hurricane Andrew) had hurricane winds\nhalf that size,'' he said.\n\n\n   ``Andrew was really a symmetrical storm in terms of\nthunderstorms around it, that were all equal distance from the\ncenter. This storm and Hugo are asymmetric, which has implications\nin terms of its outer effects. Tornadoes are more likely because\nthere are more outer bands to have tornadoes in and because it's\nmuch bigger, it's much wetter.''\n\n\n   For most of the weekend, Palm Beach County and the Treasure\nCoast will have warm calm weather, with highs in the upper 80s and\n90s and lows in the 70s. There is a 40 percent chance of afternoon\nshowers.\n\n\n   Story Filed By Cox Newspapers\n\n\n   For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service",

The eye is 20-30 miles wide. In the Northern\nHemisphere of the Earth, winds move counterclockwise around the\neye. In the Southern Hemisphere, winds circulate clockwise.\n\n\n   Hurricanes develop over tropical ocean waters and many remain\nthere. When a hurricane does approach land, skies begin to darken\nand winds strengthen. The hurricane begins driving water ahead of\nit in a storm surge or tidal wave that can be 20 feet at its peak.\nHurricanes can also trigger tornadoes and floods.\n\n\n   How are hurricanes named?\n\n\n   The World Meteorological Organization has chosen an alphabetical\nlist of names for tropical storms and hurricanes, and the list\nrotates every six years. That practice started in 1953. Names used\nfor storms this year are the same that were used in 1993.\n\n\n   The names of tropical storms and hurricanes used to be all\nwomen's names until 1978 and '79. Now, men's names are alternated\nwith women's.\n\n\n   Sometimes, when a hurricane is particularly destructive, the\nname is retired, which means the name can't be used for at least 10\nyears.\n\n\n   One such name was Hurricane Andrew, which struck Florida and\nLouisiana in 1992. The storm caused 54 deaths and up to $30 billion\nin damage.\n\n\n   To put that in context, the Galveston, Texas hurricane of 1900\n(before hurricanes were named) caused 6,000 deaths, the most in\nU.S. history, according to the World Almanac and Book of Facts.\n\n\n   Where and when are most hurricanes in the United States?\n\n\n   Florida has the most hurricanes in the United States, the\nNational Hurricane Center reports.\n\n\n   Other places vulnerable to hurricanes are the coasts along the\nGulf of Mexico and the North Atlantic Ocean, from Texas to Maine.\n\n\n   The hurricane season is from June 1 to Nov. 30, and peak months\nare August and September.\n\n\n   Which hurricanes and tropical storms have formed in the Atlantic\nOcean this year?\n\n\n   Arlene: This tropical storm formed on June 11 and spent its life\nat sea in the central Atlantic. Winds reached 65 mph.\n\n\n   Bret: This hurricane struck the Texas coast near Corpus Christi\nand Brownsville on Aug. 22. It had winds of 125 mph.\n\n\n   Cindy: This hurricane formed near the Cape Verde Islands west of\nthe African country of Senegal but did not come ashore. On Aug. 28,\nit reached its peak intensity of 140 mph.\n\n\n   Dennis: This storm formed on Aug. 23, became a hurricane on Aug.\n26 and reached 105 mph on Aug. 28. It moved up the southeast U.S.\ncoast and struck the North Carolina coast on Aug. 30.\n\n\n   Emily: This tropical storm formed on Aug. 24 and reached wind\nspeeds of 65 mph.\n\n\n   Floyd: This storm was upgraded to a hurricane on Sept. 10,\nreaching peak winds of 155 mph. Blowing from the Bahamas to the\nCarolinas to New England, it caused 60 deaths, immense flooding of\nroads and buildings, and mass road closures and power outages. Walt\nDisney World was closed for bad weather for the first time in its\nhistory.\n\n\n   Gert: Winds from this storm reached 130 to 145 mph on Sept. 17\nand caused damage to structures and beaches in Bermuda.

In\nFlorida, the bodies of two fishermen were found off Panama City,\none on a beach near the town and the other 10 miles at sea.\nInjuries were few and mostly minor, Florida officials said.\n\n\n   Downgraded to a tropical storm, the storm was traveling through\nthe southeastern states with sustained winds of 45 miles an hour\nand was expected to stay inland through Friday.\n\n\n   ``Considering the size of the storm and how erratic it was, for\nthe most part we got out pretty well,'' said Ann Rowe, a\nspokeswoman with the Florida Division of Emergency Management.\n\n\n   Rated as a Category 1 hurricane, the mildest classification,\nEarl approached with menacing winds of 100 miles an hour but lost\nsome of that punch as it went ashore near Panama City, a beach area\nof about 35,000 residents that bulges with tourists in the summer.\nBut it was storm surges of 7 to 12 feet that caused the most\ndamage, state officials said.\n\n\n   Sixteen counties along the coast south and southwest of\nTallahassee reported heavy beach erosion, damage to more than 1,100\nhomes, submerged coastal roads and more than 15,000 residents\nwithout electric power. Six counties reported tornadoes.\n\n\n   Residents who wanted to return home on Thursday after being\nevacuated were sometimes blocked by impassable roads. Gov. Lawton\nChiles, who asked the federal government for a disaster declaration\nto insure financial aid, said most damage was caused by flooding\nand a surge that some residents said was worse than previous\nhurricanes that have pounded the area recently. Comprehensive\ndamage reports were note expected for a day or so.\n\n\n   ``It looks like we got quite a bit of water,'' the governor said\nat a news briefing.\n\n\n   But state tourism officials said the hurricane caused ``little\nto no damage'' to tourist destinations of the Panhandle. Panama\nCity, Destin, Pensacola and Fort Walton Beach all had reported\nfavorable conditions for travel during the upcoming Labor Day\nweekend, they said, and beaches, golf courses and campgrounds were\nopen.\n\n\n   The scene was less relaxing in areas like Shell Island, a small\ncommunity in Wakulla County, where 26 boats, ranging from small\nfishing vessels to large cabin cruisers, washed away from a marina\nand were bobbing atop the water in front lawns.",

The area surrounding the Clear Creek area\nof Houston, near the coast, would be under 22 feet of water, he\nadded.\n\n\n   The estimates are part of a county study simulating what would\nhappen if a category-five hurricane passed through Houston. No such\nhurricane has made landfall here.\n\n\n   ``It is a big concern that when a big hurricane comes toward\nthis community, people will not take it seriously and will not\nunderstand the impact,'' Eckels said at the 2000 Houston/Galveston\nHurricane Workshop in Pasadena, Texas.\n\n\n   Meanwhile, experts in Washington said Gulf Coast residents\nshould brace for more hurricanes than the average season, possibly\nseven or more.\n\n\n   The average season brings 9.3 tropical storms, 5.8 of hurricane\nstrength and 2.1 of intense hurricane strength.\n\n\n   Tropical storms form and receive names when their circulating\nwinds reach 39 mph. They become hurricanes when their winds reach\n74 mph and major hurricanes when winds reach 111 mph.\n\n\n   The hurricane season, which begins June 1 and ends Nov. 30,\nlikely will bring stronger and longer-lasting storms than usual,\nincluding three or more ``major'' hurricanes with sustained winds\nover 110 mph, said scientists at the National Oceanic and\nAtmospheric Administration.\n\n\n   ``It's not just about the number'' of storms, said Max Mayfield,\ndirector of NOAA's National Hurricane Center. ``What really counts\nis where they make landfall and how strong they are. Just one\nhurricane over your community makes it a very bad year.''\n\n\n   Last month, the Weather Research Center in Houston and hurricane\nexpert William Gray at Colorado State University predicted a quiet\nseason.\n\n\n   At the Pasadena workshop, experts addressed the possibility of a\nstorm similar to the 1900 Galveston hurricane, which killed an\nestimated 8,000 people and remains the deadliest natural disaster\nin America.\n\n\n   Since that storm, Galveston has constructed a seawall and raised\nthe grade of the island. &UR;\n\n\n   &LR; ``Think about all the people that have moved here,'' said Bill\nRead, meteorologist in charge at the Houston-Galveston National\nWeather Service. Read estimated as much as 30 percent of the\nHouston area's population did not live here when Hurricane Alicia\nmade landfall in 1983.\n\n\n   Over the last decade, no hurricanes and only three tropical\nstorms have affected the upper Texas coast. Many believe this\nrelative quiet will cause people to become more relaxed in their\nhurricane preparations.\n\n\n   Chris Landsea, meteorologist at the NOAA's Hurricane Research\nDivision, said in Pasadena that fault for much of the damage will\nfall on residents instead of Mother Nature.\n\n\n   ``I don't like to call it a natural disaster,'' Landsea said.\n``We help make them.''\n\n\n   In Washington, NOAA officials expressed concern about a survey\nthat shows people in hurricane-prone regions are largely\nill-informed on the basics of hurricane preparation.\n\n\n   For example, most people do not know that flooding causes the\nmajority of deaths during hurricanes and nearly half are unaware\nthat homeowner's insurance does not cover flood damage, according\nto the May telephone survey of 1,037 people in several southern\nstates, including Texas.\n\n\n   For more hurricane preparedness information, log on to the Web\nsite www.fema.gov/hu98/hurinfo.htm\n\n\n   &QL; \nXXXX END OF STORY &QL;\n\n\n   $$$",

Forecasters said they might also \nissue a hurricane watch for part of Florida's east coast Monday. \n\n\n\tIf Floyd stays on its current path, it would hit the coast of  \nFlorida between West Palm Beach and Cocoa Beach. Forecasters \nexpected the hurricane to begin turning north before landfall, \nthough perhaps not much before. \n\n\n\tA U.S. hurricane hunter airplane reported Sunday evening that  \nFloyd's winds had topped the 131 mph mark of a very dangerous \nCategory 4 storm. \n\n\n\t``I didn't expect such a very fast intensification today,'' said  \nJerry Jarrell, director of the National Hurricane Center in Miami. \n``This is a real surprise for us.'' \n\n\n\tHurricane Andrew had Category 4 status when it struck South  \nFlorida in 1992, killing 26 people and causing an estimated $25 \nbillion in damage. \n\n\n\tExperts said that by Tuesday Hurricane Floyd could approach the  \nAbacos Islands and Eleuthera, which were blasted last month by \nHurricane Dennis. \n\n\n\t``I just got back on my feet from last month's scare,'' sighed  \nMarie Johnson of Nassau as she pulled out a few bills to pay for \nflashlight and radio batteries at the City Market grocery store. \n\n\n\tThe U.S. National Weather Service recommended people along the  \nsoutheast coast monitor the storm's course. \n\n\n\tIn Florida, emergency management officials began mobilizing,  \nwith the state's Emergency Operations Center in Tallahassee calling \nin essential personnel for 'round-the-clock staffing. \n\n\n\tMany Floridians took advantage of the weekend's final day to  \ntake careful inventory of their hurricane supplies. Osvaldo Ibarra, \nhardware manager at a Home Depot in Miami, said sales were brisk \nfor batteries, nails, rope and hurricane shutter fasteners. \n\n\n\t``People are really buying the extra screws, the rope, and we've  \nseen a lot more generator sales,'' Ibarra said. \n\n\n\tIn Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, south of the storm's  \ncenter, meteorologists warned that the terrain was already \nsaturated, and that there could be heavy flooding. \n\n\n\tOfficials posted warnings for Hurricane Floyd across the central  \nBahamas and hurricane watches throughout the northwest Bahamas. \nTropical storm warnings were in effect for the southeast Bahamas \nand Britain's Turks and Caicos Islands. \n\n\n\tThe storm swelled in size during the weekend. Hurricane-force  \nwinds had broadened to 115 miles from Floyd's center by Sunday. \nTropical storm force winds extended another 175 miles, and \nforecasters said the storm would likely strengthen overnight \nSunday. \n\n\n\tAt 11 p.m. EDT, Floyd was centered about 330 miles east of San  \nSalvador in the central Bahamas, and was moving west at near 14 \nmph. \n\n\n\tFloyd's center is likely to pass close to the capital, Nassau,  \non Tuesday morning, said Arthur Rolle, deputy director of the \nBahamas Meteorological Department. \n\n\n\tOn Sunday, tourists in Nassau watched weather reports nervously.  \nHoneymooners Michael and Julie Smith of Reynoldsburg, Ohio, \nlamented their bad luck. \n\n\n\t``I hope this doesn't mean our marriage is going to be like this  \n-- messed up,'' Michael said. \n\n\n\tResidents Jean and Jerry Isaacs said they had canceled plans to  \nspend a few days in Florida. \n\n\n\t``We could get over okay today, but by the way things are going,  \nit'll be tough getting back,'' Jean Isaacs said. \n\n\n\tElsewhere, Floyd was joined Sunday by Tropical Storm Gert, which  \nformed midway between Africa and Barbados. Forecasters said it was \ngathering strength quickly and could become a hurricane Sunday \nnight or Monday.",

Beachfront houses were swamped. Boats\nwere tossed ashore.\n\n\n   They found none of that Thursday as they streamed back to survey\nthe damage from Hurricane Bonnie, which blew through this area on\nWednesday afternoon. A few shingles were missing, a few dwellings\nand businesses had water damage.\n\n\n   The dunes, artificially replenished earlier this year, had lost\na bit of sand. A single small boat, the Bahama Gem, had been lifted\nout of the marsh and deposited on a muddy bank. Even the Shell\nIsland Resort, a beachfront condominium that is close to falling\ninto the sea, suffered little noticeable damage.\n\n\n   ``We're very fortunate,'' said Ed Taylor, an assistant to the\ntown manager.\n\n\n   In Brunswick County, just south of Wilmington, officials\nexpressed amazement at the dearth of significant destruction.\n``It's totally unreal, especially as big as this hurricane was and\nas long as it hung around,'' said Cecil Logan, a spokesman for the\ncounty's disaster services. That was the sentiment up and down the\nNorth Carolina coast Thursday as coastal residents, waterlogged but\nrelieved, awoke to the realization that Hurricane Bonnie had not\nlived up to her advance notices.\n\n\n   Although the National Hurricane Center reported that the\ncategory 3 storm carried maximum sustained winds of 115 mph, there\nwere few physical signs that its power had been that intense. Some\nlongtime residents said they had developed an ear for hurricanes,\nand could tell from the sound of the hurricane that it would not be\nas destructive as Fran, which caused nearly $6 billion in property\ndamage.\n\n\n   State officials said it was too early to make a dollar\nassessment of the damage from the latest hurricane.\n\n\n   Grover Gore, a 66-year-old lawyer who has lived for 33 years on\nthe Cape Fear River in Southport, said that really bad storms would\nprogress from whistling to howling to roaring to screeching to\nscreaming. ``We had screeching but we didn't have as much of it as\nwith Fran,'' he said.\n\n\n   As the hurricane was downgraded to a tropical storm Thursday,\nwith winds of 70 mph slowly churning northward through eastern\nNorth Carolina, there were still no reports of deaths or serious\ninjuries from it. Many of the injuries that were reported by area\nhospitals, including electric shocks and carbon monoxide poisoning,\nresulted from the improper use of generators.\n\n\n   There were, of course, plenty of ecological consequences,\nparticularly for sand dunes and rain-sodden rivers. The Pamlico\nRiver washed over its banks in places near Washington, N.C., as did\nthe Neuse River in New Bern, where major highways were closed. Many\ncities in the region received between nine and 11 inches of\nrainfall in the last two days.\n\n\n   Residents in Carolina Beach, just south of here, close to where\nthe eye of the storm made landfall, reported that several feet of\nsand had washed ashore on the north end of their island.\n\n\n   At North Topsail Beach, early assessments indicated that 60\npercent of the dunes had washed away, some in half-mile long\nchunks. On one end of the island, a truck was buried in sand to the\ntops of its tires. Boardwalks were twisted and torn away and some\nhouses were perched precariously near the edge of the water,\nbecause of beach and dune erosion.\n\n\n   North Topsail Beach, with the help of the Federal Emergency\nManagement Agency, had spent $2 million replenishing the dunes\nblown away by Hurricanes Fran and Bertha in 1996.\n\n\n   ``We're just going to have to start over again,'' said Tony\nHammond, the town manager. ``The ones that had the vegetation\nseemed to have held up better.

      "content": "&HT;   \n\n\n\n   ATLANTA _ Hello, Dennis. Goodbye drought?\n\n\n   If Hurricane Dennis dumps tropical rains from Florida to\nVirginia on Sunday and into next week, the storm could be just the\ntonic to help quench a thirsty South, parched by drought the last\n17 months.\n\n\n   Forecasters said Dennis and other tropical storms headed toward\nthe United States could help replenish the water-strapped South,\nwhich is running 2-foot rainfall deficits in some places. Among\nthose who would rather get their rain some other way is Ray Allen,\na 56-year-old North Carolina farmer who tends 500 acres in\nElizabethtown, 80 miles inland from Myrtle Beach, S.C. _ a\npotential coastal target for Dennis.\n\n\n   ``Hurricanes are not our friends,'' said Allen, whose crops were\ndrenched by afternoon rains not associated with the coming of\nDennis two days this week. ``Winds will hurt you more than the rain\nwill help you.''\n\n\n   Lack of rain already has damaged his corn crop. More than 40\npercent of his tobacco crop _ including the most valuable plant\ntips _ remains in the field. Last year, Hurricane Bonnie blew apart\n39 percent of his tobacco. The storm dropped 20 inches of rain in\nsome parts of the state.\n\n\n   ``Sometimes, probably you hear farmers say that a hurricane made\ntheir crop,'' Allen said. ``But I'm not sure. I think they tear up\nmore than they ever help.''\n\n\n   Hurricane Dennis was moving less than 10 mph Friday. One\ncomputer model showed an inland storm system pushing Dennis out to\nsea. Another had it brushing Florida before coming perilously close\nto Charleston.\n\n\n   ``The trend now looks like it will get caught in a low pressure\ntrough and head northeast so most of the rain would stay on the\ncoast,'' said Jan Jackson, a meteorologist in Blacksburg, Va., one\nof the driest places in the country.\n\n\n   A direct hit is what's needed to ease water problems in places\nsuch as Atlanta and the Research Triangle.\n\n\n   ``If we get a glancing blow, Georgia will probably not get\nenough rain to be beneficial,'' said David Stooksbury, Georgia's\nstate climatologist and a professor of engineering at the\nUniversity of Georgia. ``Basically, it's going to have to go right\nover us to have much of a beneficial impact.''\n\n\n   North Carolina, Tennessee and South Carolina have asked for\nfederal assistance to help farmers recover drought losses. In\nGeorgia, nearly 80 percent of the state suffers from a moderate to\nsevere drought, especially in the southern farm regions.\n\n\n   Severe drought has seared Virginia's Shenandoah Valley.\nRoanoke's reservoirs have dipped to historic lows.\n\n\n   If Dennis or other tropical storms penetrate deeply inland, ``it\ncould have quite an impact,'' said Jackson, the Virginia\nmeteorologist. ``Usually this time of year, that's what ends\ndroughts.'' A drenching of 6 to 8 inches over several days would be\noptimal.\n\n\n   ``Yes, the rain will be welcomed,'' Stooksbury said. ``But the\ntrick is getting the rain without getting enough to have\nflooding.''\n\n\n   In July 1994, Tropical Storm Alberto lingered over Georgia for\nfive days, drenching some places with 28 inches of rain, turning\ncountry roads into canals. Nearly 700 billion gallons of water\nwashed into the Flint River between Albany and Newton.\n\n\n   ``Any rain we're going to get is helpful. But we also don't want\n6 inches in six hours,'' Stooksbury said. ``That will cause untold\nproblems. Even in agriculture, we can't say everyone wants rain.''\n\n\n   Hurricane Dennis could produce up to 15 inches of rain along the\nGeorgia coast, Georgia Emergency Management Agency Director Gary\nMcConnell said Friday.\n\n\n   Last week, Hurricane Bret washed across the southern tip of\nTexas then pushed to the middle of the state. The storm destroyed\n$27 million of cotton.\n\n\n   On the plus side, it soaked the inland Rio Grande Valley, which\ngrows a bountiful crop of grapefruit and oranges. But drenching\nrain could seriously damage Deep South cotton and tobacco.\n\n\n   ``The torrential rains would only hurt some of those big tobacco\nleaves,'' said Bob Graham, chief agricultural statistician for\nSouth Carolina, which",

Some \nroofs were blown off in Falfurrias as the storm moved inland this \nmorning, the weather service said. \n\n\n\tWorkers from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Texas  \nDivision of Emergency Management and the Texas Department of Public \nSafety prepared this morning to move into the storm-blown areas. \n\n\n\t``At first daylight, there will be preliminary damage assessment  \nteams that will go into the area and begin to inspect the damage,'' \nFEMA spokesman Brad Craine said today. \n\n\n\tAs of 6 a.m. EDT today, Bret remained a Category 1 hurricane --  \nthe weakest of five possible strengths -- with 85 mph winds. The \nformer Category 4 storm made landfall with winds blowing at 125 \nmph. \n\n\n\tOn Sunday, Bret unleashed its power on the deserted Padre Island  \nNational Seashore, 70 miles south of Corpus Christi, before \ncontinuing into desolate, sparsely populated ranch land. \n\n\n\tThe center of Bret moved inland over Brooks County as it headed  \nwest toward Mexico at 5 mph. Hurricane warnings along the coast \nwere downgraded to tropical storm warnings this morning. \n\n\n\tThousands of residents from Brownsville to Corpus Christi had  \nfled north and west as the hurricane approached. Windows throughout \nthe region were taped and boarded in anticipation of the worst \nstorm since Hurricane Allen, another Category 4 storm that struck \nroughly the same area in 1980, causing $55 million in damage. \n\n\n\t``I think it was overpublicized,'' said Ralph Huff, who defied  \nconventional wisdom -- and an evacuation order -- and stayed in his \ncinder block home overlooking Baffin Bay, just east of this small \nagricultural town. His phone and power were still working late \nSunday. \n\n\n\tDespite the storm's center passing less than 10 miles to the  \nsouth, ``there wasn't even any storm surge,'' he said. \n\n\n\tThe 125 mph winds, with gusts blowing even higher, extended 40  \nmiles out from the storm when it first hit land. Forecasters feared \npossible tornadoes, a foot or more of rain and a storm surge that \ncould approach 10 to 15 feet as it moved over land. \n\n\n\tBefore the tightly-focused storm made land, National Weather  \nService forecaster Jim Hoke said it had ``clear potential of \nproducing major disaster.'' He compared the storm to Hurricane \nAndrew, which battered Florida in 1992. \n\n\n\tAs Bret arrived, whitecaps crashed into Corpus Christi's seawall  \nand palm trees along the cost bent and frayed with the gusts. A few \nsurfers in Corpus Christi even took to the storm-fed waves. \n\n\n\tFor those who fled, shelters were set up inland in San Antonio,  \nand hotels offered discounts for evacuees with proof of residence. \n\n\n\tA few stragglers stayed behind on the Padre and Mustang barrier  \nislands after all access to the mainland was severed. The incoming \nstorm, coupled with high tide, threatened to cause coastal \nflooding. \n\n\n\tGov. George W. Bush said he would sign disaster proclamations  \nfor seven counties: Aransas, San Patricio, Kenedy, Cameron, \nWillacy, Nueces and Kleberg. \n\n\n\tPresident Clinton issued a major disaster declaration Sunday  \nnight for the seven counties, freeing funds to help local \ngovernments with emergency supplies and debris removal, said FEMA \nDirector James Lee Witt. \n\n\n\tTexas hadn't been hit by a hurricane since Hurricane Jerry  \nkilled three people in October 1989.

By\nreaching at least 200 miles inland and wreaking havoc in the\nmountains of southern Honduras and northern Nicaragua, Mitch\nexploded a number of myths about hurricanes.\n\n\n   Conventional wisdom suggests that hurricanes do most of their\ndamage when heavy winds attack the coastline. But Mitch and a\nnumber of other recent hurricanes show that storm systems can\nsometimes be more deadly when heavy rains fall in mountains\nhundreds of miles inland.\n\n\n   After watching the devastation from Mitch, even some of the\nworld's top hurricane experts acknowledge they may need to\nre-evaluate how they go about warning people of potential\ndestruction.\n\n\n   ``We're still a little anchored to this idea that the first\nthing is to get people away from the coast,'' said Jerry Jarrell,\nthe director of the National Hurricane Center in Miami.\n\n\n   The potential for massive death in the highlands is ``probably\nan issue that gets overlooked,'' he said, noting that after\nwatching the effect of Mitch he will begin think of possible\nchanges to the way the service warns about hurricanes.\n\n\n   Not only did Mitch cause most of its damage after it had been\ndowngraded from a hurricane to a tropical storm, but it also killed\nmore than 4,000 people in neighboring Nicaragua, a country that\nreceived little direct warning of the catastrophic flooding coming\nits way. ``We didn't think it was going to come to Nicaragua,''\nsaid Mauricio Rosales, the head of the Nicaraguan government's\nmeteorology department. ``They U.S. hurricane officials didn't warn\nus.''\n\n\n   Jarrell acknowledges that Nicaragua might not have received\nenough attention. ``I'm not sure we did that much for them,'' he\nsaid.\n\n\n   Still, no one can say that the National Hurricane Center ignored\nthe potential for problems in the hills.\n\n\n   While predicting that the storm would likely move northwest\ntoward Belize or Mexico, the service also gave ample warning about\npossible problems in the hills.\n\n\n   One early warning from Oct. 27 noted that heavy rains in the\nmountains of Honduras and other parts of Central American ``could\ncause life-threatening flash floods and mud slides.''\n\n\n   Moreover, U.S. hurricane experts note that each nation has\nresponsibility to warn its own citizens, and weather experts within\nthe country need to study how a storm might affect their own\nterritory.\n\n\n   ``These things vary depending on the country,'' said Chris\nLandsea, a hurricane researcher at the National Oceanic and\nAtmospheric Association. ``The individual weather services need to\ntailor their advisories based on their own terrain.''\n\n\n   Though it is funded entirely by U.S. taxpayers, the National\nHurricane Center provides storm-warning services to all of the\nCaribbean and Latin America under an international system.\n\n\n   In other parts of the world, Japan, Australia, India and other\ncountries share in paying for the monitoring system.\n\n\n   Jarrell said the system was established under U.S. leadership\nbecause other countries simply couldn't afford the sophisticated\nsatellites and airborne reconnaissance required to predict\nhurricane movements.\n\n\n   The United States is required to give",

(AP) -- Hurricane Irene brought rain and high wind  \nto the Florida Keys today after drenching Cuba's tobacco fields and \ncausing scattered building collapses in Havana, where at least two \npeople were killed. \n\n\n\tThough barely a hurricane with winds of 75 mph, the storm cut  \npower intermittently in this resort city as Irene's center passed \nnearby during the morning. Up to 10 inches of rain flooded some \nmain streets and most secondary roads in Key West and two \nneighboring islands. \n\n\n\tTorrential rains pounded the lower third of the Florida  \npeninsula as the storm crawled across the straits separating Cuba \nfrom the United States. \n\n\n\t``We're experiencing some strong tropical storm conditions right  \nnow from Key West all the way up the Keys as far as Ocean Reef \nright now,'' Billy Wagner, Monroe County Emergency Management \ndirector, said this morning. Big Pine Key had a gust recorded at \n103 mph, the National Weather Service said. \n\n\n\tThe weak hurricane was expected to come ashore on the mainland  \nby early evening in the Everglades, sending a 5- to 7-foot storm \nsurge into Key Largo, and pass over Lake Okeechobee before pushing \ninto the Atlantic. \n\n\n\tForecasters had worried about Irene sending more rain to parts  \nof North Carolina flooded by Hurricane Floyd, but said early this \nafternoon that a shift to the east in the may spare the Carolinas \nby keeping the storm off the coast. \n\n\n\tA tropical storm warning covered 280 miles of the Atlantic  \nCoast, a storm warning or hurricane watch covered 235 miles along \nthe Gulf Coast, and a tornado watch was in effect for South \nFlorida. Street flooding, downed tree limbs and outages were \nreported across the state. \n\n\n\tAs the storm approached, Collier County, the southernmost Gulf  \nCoast county on the Florida mainland, closed public schools and \ngovernment offices today. MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa arranged \nto fly its six refueling tankers to safety in Kansas. \n\n\n\tForecasters said rainfall totals could top 15 inches.  \n\n\n\t``It's not a well-organized hurricane, and there's a huge swath  \nof storms and rain to the east'' of its center, said Richard Pasch, \na hurricane specialist at the National Hurricane Center outside \nMiami. In the city, there was local flooding and authorities asked \nemployers to send workers home early. \n\n\n\tAt 2 p.m. EDT, Irene's center was located about 25 miles  \nsouthwest of Flamingo on the southern tip of Florida's peninsula. \nIt was moving northeast at 10 mph. \n\n\n\tOfficials in Monroe County, which covers the Keys, ordered a  \nmandatory evacuation of mobile homes and recreational vehicles. \nSchools were closed. \n\n\n\t``It's been raining throughout the night; we've been getting  \nquite a few inches of rain and the wind has picked up enormously \nfrom when I came in at (midnight),'' said David Holliman, a \nsecurity guard at the Lower Keys Medical Center in Key West. ``The \ntrees are swaying quite a bit ... and it's getting worse.'' \n\n\n\tFour shelters were opened in the Keys: two in Key West and one  \neach in Marathon and Key Largo. \n\n\n\t``We worked all day yesterday. By the time we finished, it was  \ntoo late to go north,'' said Jose Guadarrama, a mobile home \nresident who arrived at the shelter this morning. \n\n\n\tIn Key West, the collapse of a concrete seawall at the  \noceanfront Key Ambassador Best Western allowed waves to wash over \nthe road, pulling chairs, shoes and seaweed in their wake. \n\n\n\t``It's like a treasure hunt out here,'' said hotel auditor  \nBrandon Boyce. Driving rain seeped through the roof or shutters. \n``We've got trash cans everywhere trying to catch it,'' he said. \n\n\n\tA possible path toward eastern North Carolina had been unwelcome  \nnews there, since rivers only recently receded below flood stage \nfollowing Hurricane Floyd's 20-inch deluge last month, blamed for \n49 deaths and record damage.

COASTLINE \n\n\n\n   WILMINGTON, N.C. _ The heart of Hurricane Floyd raked across the\nmainland here at Cape Fear Thursday morning, uprooting beach houses\nand leaving widespread floods as it set a rapid but steadily\nweakening course up the Atlantic coast.\n\n\n   The vast storm, whose advent alarmed much of the Eastern\nseaboard and widely disrupted air, rail and highway travel, was\nclearly losing its power with the dawn Thursday as the hurricane's\neye danced across the coastline following a two-week buildup of the\nforces of nature and the precautions of government.\n\n\n   By Thursday evening, as Floyd reached northeastward along the\nNew Jersey coast to New York City, its strength had further waned.\nIt was downgraded to a tropical storm that still delivered lashing\nrain but that officials said presented no major threat to New York\nor other population centers.\n\n\n   At least 12 deaths were attributed to Floyd, eight of them from\ntraffic accidents in the Carolinas and Virginia. Two girls in\nDelaware drowned after a storm-swollen creek swept them into a\nsewage pipe; a woman was killed in Virginia when a tree fell on her\nmobile home, and one man was presumed drowned in the Bahamas.\n\n\n   The storm swept away parts of a bridge in North East, Md.,\nforcing 100 families downstream to abandon their homes. Four oil\ntanks holding 80,000 gallons collapsed, though officials were\nunsure if the oil contaminated nearby Chesapeake Bay.\n\n\n   In the howling predawn of this coastal city, Floyd's power was\nmeasured to be dropping from a Category 4 to a Category 2 hurricane\nbefore dropping further to a tropical storm. While storm-drenched\nhurricane veterans were delighted after all the ominous evacuation\nwarnings that it delivered far less physical injury and property\ndestruction than originally feared, Floyd nevertheless proved\nrelentlessly drenching, dropping as much as 19 inches of rain in\nsome areas, and cutting power to 1.4 million in the Carolinas.\n\n\n   ``We were blessed this time,'' Fire Chief Keith Studt said as he\nroamed flooded streets and hacked away at fallen trees cluttering\nthe streets of nearby Winter Park. ``We were lucky this thing\nsuddenly ratcheted down before it hit town.''\n\n\n   Even so, the flooding and house damage out on Oak Island and\nother coastal barrier islands was considerable as the storm headed\nunpredictably northward, causing further disruption across a wide\nswath of the seaboard. Residents emerged uncertainly here from\nemergency centers to blink at piles of suddenly sun-dappled debris.\nBy then Floyd was speeding up along the coast by Virginia,\nChesapeake Bay and the New Jersey shore.\n\n\n   It lost further power but still spewed fresh damage along its\nwestern flank as the storm was described as fading into a rough\ncourse aimed toward eastern Long Island. But travel turmoil was\nwidespread during the day and quickly became bumper to bumper\naround Washington, as a truck overturned on the storm-lashed\nChesapeake Bay Bridge and blocked one of the major regional\narteries.\n\n\n   On St. Michael's, a resort and retirement village on an\nelbowlike peninsula reaching into Chesapeake Bay, the day's rain\nand winds started turning savage in midafternoon as the eye of the\nstorm approached.\n\n\n   Lawrence Murphy is a netter, who fishes with nets attached to\npoles. He left two, $10,000 polenets standing in the bay, where he\nassumed they would be safe from a northeaster.\n\n\n   ``But it's coming from the northwest,'' Murphy said. He said his\nnets had withstood 40-mph winds. ``But this was 60 or 70,'' he\nsaid, figuring his rigs were lost. ``The netters are caught real\nbad.''\n\n\n   The storm's eye loomed out of the Atlantic's 30-foot seas as a\nsomewhat tentative invader, avoiding a deep inland attack and\ncutting across Cape Fear at 3:20 a.m. to begin a rapid ride up the\ncoastline. Open relief at the turning was the reaction from this\nstorm-hardened city, which has had to batten down for five\nhurricanes in the last three years.\n\n\n   ``It was merciful that it didn't come through at the 155 mph\nthey were firs",

(AP) - As Tropical Storm Gordon threatened to become\na hurricane and strike Florida's Gulf Coast, Gov. Jeb Bush on\nSaturday activated emergency response teams.\n\n\n   State officials said they expect Gordon to be a Category 1\nhurricane with winds of between 74 and 95 mph when it strikes land\nanywhere between Fort Myers and the Panhandle sometime late Sunday.\n\n\n   Rains of five inches or more are expected and coastal areas\nshould anticipate a storm surge, said Joe Myers, the state\nemergency management director.\n\n\n   The National Hurricane Center issued a tropical storm warning\nSaturday that covered a 210-mile stretch from Bonita Beach just\nsouth of Fort Myers to the Suwanee River, about 100 miles north of\nTampa.\n\n\n   Forecasters also issued a hurricane watch for a 400-mile stretch\nfrom Bonita Beach to the Panhandle town of Apalachicola. They said\nGordon could reach hurricane strength by late Saturday.\n\n\n   A tropical storm warning means a storm with winds of between 39\nand 73 mph is expected to hit an area within the next 24 hours. A\nhurricane watch means a storm with winds of 74 mph or greater could\nhit within the next 36 hours.\n\n\n   At 2 p.m. EDT, Gordon was located near latitude 24.1 north and\nlongitude 86.1 west - about 345 miles southwest of Tampa. Its winds\nhave increased from 65 to 70 mph, 4 mph below hurricane strength.\n\n\n   Two to five inches of rain are expected across portions of South\nFlorida and the Keys on Saturday, forecasters said.\n\n\n   Saturday afternoon, counties along central Florida's Gulf Coast\nbegan recommending voluntary evacuation for residents in barrier\nislands and coastal or low lying areas.\n\n\n   Disaster officials in Hernando, Manatee and Pinellas counties\ntold residents they should start packing, and that shelters would\nbe opened Saturday evening. Other counties were awaiting later\nforecasts before deciding whether of advise their residents to\nevacuate.\n\n\n   The storm is even causing some concern on Florida's Atlantic\ncoast - at Cape Canaveral, NASA considered Saturday moving space\nshuttle Discovery off its seaside launch pad and into it's hangar.\nDiscovery is scheduled to blast off on a space-station construction\nmission on Oct. 5.\n\n\n   Gordon's affect is already being felt in Cuba and Mexico.\n\n\n   Heavy rains of seven to 10 inches affected parts of western Cuba\nearly Saturday, and heavy rains were reported Friday on Mexico's\nYucatan Peninsula. That caused street flooding in the resort city\nof Cancun.\n\n\n   Meanwhile, tropical storm force winds struck Bermuda on Saturday\nas Hurricane Florence passed to the island nation's north, but the\nstorm is not expected to score a direct hit.\n\n\n   Winds of 60 mph hit Bermuda early Saturday, but no damage was\nreported, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\n\n   At 10 a.m. EDT, Florence was 180 miles north of Bermuda and was\nmoving to the northeast at 25 mph. Near its center, it still packed\nhurricane force winds of 75 mph, but those missed the island,\nforecasters said.\n\n\n   ''There was no structural damage. There was no flooding,'' said\nJames Buxton, meteorologist with the Bermuda Weather Service. ''For\na few hours, winds reached tropical storm force.''\n\n\n   Rip currents associated with Florence were blamed for at least\nthree surf deaths Tuesday in North Carolina.\n\n\n   Meanwhile, a tropical depression that was sighted in the tropics\nearly Saturday has been downgraded to a tropical wave because\nhurricane hunters could find no clear center of circulation.\n\n\n   However, the wave is still carrying 35 mph winds and gusts to\ntropical storm force in squalls are likely over parts of the\nLeewards later Saturday.\n\n\n   At 1 p.m. EDT, the wave was located about 230 miles east of\nGuadeloupe in the Leeward Islands and was moving west near 17 mph.\n\n\n   A tropical storm watch has been discontinued for the Leeward\nIslands.\n\n\n   On the Net:\n\n\n   National Hurricane Center: http://www.nhc.noaa.gov\n\n\n AP-ES-09-16-00 1450",

SCHMID, Associated Press Writer\n\n\n   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hurricane season is fast approaching and the\noutlook isn't pretty.\n\n\n   Federal storm specialists predicted an above-average storm\nseason Wednesday, calling for stronger, longer-lasting storms this\nyear, and more of them.\n\n\n   Hurricane season officially begins June 1, and the outlook is\nfor 11 tropical storms, seven of which will be hurricanes, three of\nthem major.\n\n\n   ''This puts coastal areas and the Caribbean islands at a much\nhigher risk of experiencing a tropical storm or hurricane,'' said\nD. James Baker, head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric\nAdministration.\n\n\n   The forecast is similar to last year's, which was followed by a\nseries of serious storms, including Hurricane Floyd, that caused\nmassive evacuations along the Southeastern coast and then inundated\nNorth Carolina.\n\n\n   The La Nina cooling of water in the Pacific Ocean, the same\ncondition that influenced the 1999 season, remains in place, Baker\nsaid.\n\n\n   ''For this reason we expect we'll have another major economic\nimpact on the United States,'' he said.\n\n\n   ''It's not just about the number'' of storms, added Max\nMayfield, director of the National Hurricane Center in Miami.\n''What really counts is where they make landfall and how strong\nthey are. Just one hurricane over your community makes it a very\nbad year.''\n\n\n   James Lee Witt, director of the Federal Emergency Management\nAgency, stressed the importance of having a plan and being prepared\nfor the storms. He cited community efforts, including Project\nImpact, which helps people strengthen their homes against storms of\nall types.\n\n\n   A poll the agency released Wednesday revealed that more than\nhalf of people vulnerable to hurricane damage don't prepare\nadequately because they underestimate their risk. Poll takers also\nconcluded that many do little to protect their homes because they\nthink the cost is much higher than it actually is. One-third of the\nhomeowners do not have an evacuation plan.\n\n\n   More than 1,200 people from Massachusettes to Texas were\nquestioned for the poll in April and May. The margin of error was\nplus or minus 3 percentage points.\n\n\n   Baker and Witt signed a memorandum pledging to work closely\ntogether to warn people of impending storms and help them prepare.\n\n\n   ''It doesn't matter how good the forecast is if people don't\nplan in advance,'' said Jack Kelly, director of the National\nWeather Service.\n\n\n   Last year's evacuations left thousands of people trapped on\njammed highways for hours and the forecasters said that is a\nproblem they hope to avoid in the future. Coastal areas subject to\nflooding need to be evacuated in storms, but not every place that\nmerely expects wind damage, they said.\n\n\n   ''You flee from storm surge, you hide from wind,'' said\nMayfield, calling on people to get storm shutters, build safe rooms\nand take other steps to prepare their homes.\n\n\n   The new outlook from the government forecasters echoes that of\nBill Gray of Colorado State University, one of the few willing to\nmake long-range storm predictions. For this season he also\npredicted 11 named storms.\n\n\n   Mayfield was picked last week to replace the retired Jerry\nJarrell as director of the hurricane center.\n\n\n   Also last week a new weather satellite was launched that can be\npressed into service this summer if needed. The $220 million GOES-L\nsatellite had been delayed a year.\n\n\n   The forecasters rely on two Geostationary Operational\nEnvironmental Satellites to monitor tropical storms and other\nsevere weather. The East Coast's GOES-8, however, is a year beyond\nits design lifetime. Although still working, it could break down at\nany moment. GOES-L is a crucial backup.\n\n\n   While some climate experts have been blaming the increase in\ntropical storms in recent years on global warming, Gray says the\ntrend is cyclical and not related to warming.\n\n\n   Asked about this Wednesday, Baker agreed.

      "content": "&HT;   \n\n\n\n   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Hurricane forecasters, stung by\ncriticism that people were caught off guard when Irene veered from\nits most likely path and moved through coastal South Florida,\nstressed again Tuesday the storm's track was within a probable\nstrike zone and would have dumped torrential rains on Palm Beach\nCounty and the Treasure Coast regardless of the change in\ndirection.\n\n\n   The National Hurricane Center near Miami said a tropical storm\nwarning for the region was appropriate because no hurricane-force\nwinds were recorded anywhere in the three counties.\n\n\n   ``I can see why things are confusing to people,'' center\ndirector Jerry Jarrell said. ``We had a hurricane. There's no\nquestion about it. But you and I didn't get hurricane conditions.\nWe got tropical storm conditions.''\n\n\n   Palm Beach County's emergency management director, Bill O'Brien,\nwas more critical of himself than the hurricane center on Tuesday,\nsaying his office opened shelters for people who didn't feel\ncomfortable in their homes but in hindsight, should have encouraged\nmobile home evacuations.\n\n\n   ``I know those guys do the very best they can,'' O'Brien said of\nthe hurricane center.\n\n\n   Jarrell said the storm's path shifted in those crucial hours on\nFriday because its eye reformed several times over land, each time\nmoving to the east _ a phenomenon forecasters can't explain. He\nsaid such events occurred last year in several storms in the Gulf\nof Mexico, with the eye jumping as much as 75 miles over to the\neast. Jarrell said that's why tracking charts showed a steady track\nto the northeast even as the center continued to forecast a\nnorthern path.\n\n\n   ``If you're connecting the dots, it was'' heading north, Jarrell\nsaid. ``But if you're watching the eye, you're seeing it reform.''\n\n\n   Jarrell said that the strongest rains were farther east of\ncenter, and had the storm stayed on a path west of Lake Okeechobee,\ncoastal Palm Beach County and the Treasure Coast would have\nreceived even more rain.\n\n\n   Jarrell also said a fire last month inside a weather computer in\nMaryland may have contributed to the less-than-exact forecast. The\ncenter made only two models a day instead of four, while other\nagencies' computers were available to do the other two models.\nJarrell said that may have hampered the forecasting but it was\nearly too say.\n\n\n   The center also suggested on Tuesday that employers consider\nsending employees home in a tropical storm warning instead of a\nhurricane warning.\n\n\n   ``It's just a meteorological distinction between 73 mph as a\ntropical storm and 74 mph as a hurricane,'' National Hurricane\nCenter spokesman Frank Lepore said.\n\n\n   ``I guess that's natural,'' O'Brien said. ``People hear\n`hurricane' and they think anything from what we saw to Andrew. We\nhave some strong storms on a routine basis in the summer that have\ntropical storm force winds.''\n\n\n   Gary Hines, senior vice president of the Business Development\nBoard of Palm Beach County, said the idea of companies sending\nworkers home in tropical storm warnings is ``worth the weather\nservice presenting it to employers.''\n\n\n   Jarrell said the center doesn't want to get into the business of\ndeciding when to open shelters, evacuate or order employees home.\n\n\n   ``Emergency management folks feel that is not our business,''\nJarrell said. ``We agree with that.''\n\n\n   Residents who suffered storm damage will base their insurance\nclaims, and deductibles, on a hurricane strike, said Don Pride,\nspokesman for the Florida Department of Insurance.\n\n\n   Eliot Kleinberg writes for the Palm Beach Post, West Palm Beach,\nFla.

Jeb Bush on\nSaturday activated emergency response teams.\n\n\n   State officials said they expect Gordon to be a Category 1\nhurricane with winds of 74 to 95 mph when it strikes land anywhere\nbetween Fort Myers and the Panhandle sometime late Sunday.\n\n\n   Rains of five inches or more are expected and coastal areas\ncould expect a storm surge, said Joe Myers, the state emergency\nmanagement director.\n\n\n   The National Hurricane Center issued a tropical storm warning\nSaturday that covered a 210-mile stretch from Bonita Beach just\nsouth of Fort Myers to the Suwanee River, about 100 miles north of\nTampa.\n\n\n   Forecasters also issued a hurricane watch for a 400-mile stretch\nfrom Bonita Beach to the Panhandle town of Apalachicola. They said\nGordon could reach hurricane strength by late Saturday.\n\n\n   A tropical storm warning means a storm with winds of between 39\nand 73 mph is expected to hit an area within the next 24 hours. A\nhurricane watch means a storm with winds of 74 mph or greater could\nhit within the next 36 hours.\n\n\n   At 10 a.m. EDT, Gordon was located about 355 miles southwest of\nTampa, with winds of 65 mph, 9 mph below hurricane strength. Two to\nfive inches of rain are expected across portions of South Florida\nand the Keys on Saturday, forecasters said.\n\n\n   Saturday afternoon, counties along central Florida's Gulf Coast\nbegan recommending voluntary evacuation for residents in barrier\nislands and coastal or low lying areas.\n\n\n   Disaster officials in Hernando, Manatee and Pinellas counties\ntold residents they should start packing, and that shelters would\nbe opened Saturday evening. Other counties were awaiting later\nforecasts before deciding whether of advise their residents to\nevacuate.\n\n\n   The storm is even causing some concern on Florida's Atlantic\ncoast - at Cape Canaveral, NASA considered Saturday moving space\nshuttle Discovery off it's seaside launch pad and into it's hangar.\nDiscovery is scheduled to blast off on a space-station construction\nmission on Oct. 5.\n\n\n   Gordon's affect is already being felt in Cuba and Mexico.\n\n\n   Heavy rains of seven to 10 inches affected parts of western Cuba\nearly Saturday, and heavy rains were reported Friday on Mexico's\nYucatan Peninsula. That caused street flooding in the resort city\nof Cancun.\n\n\n   Meanwhile, tropical storm force winds struck Bermuda on Saturday\nas Hurricane Florence passed to the island nation's north, but the\nstorm is not expected to score a direct hit.\n\n\n   Winds of 60 mph hit Bermuda early Saturday, but no damage was\nreported, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\n\n   At 7 a.m. EDT, Florence was 125 miles north of Bermuda and was\nmoving to the northeast at 25 mph. Near its center, it still packed\nhurricane force winds of 75 mph, but those are expected to miss the\nisland, forecasters said.\n\n\n   Rip currents associated with Florence were blamed for at least\nthree surf deaths Tuesday in North Carolina.\n\n\n   Meanwhile, a third disturbance was sighted in the tropics.\n\n\n   A tropical depression with 35 mph winds was located about 260\nmiles east of Guadeloupe in the Leeward Islands and was moving west\nnear 17 mph.\n\n\n   A tropical storm watch is in effect for the islands of Antigua,\nAnguilla, Barbuda, Montserrat, Nevis, St. Kitts, St. Maarten, Saba\nand St. Eustatius in the Leeward Islands.\n\n\n   Wind gusts to tropical storm force in squalls are likely over\nparts of the Leewards later Saturday.\n\n\n   On the Net:\n\n\n   National Hurricane Center: http://www.nhc.noaa.gov\n\n\n AP-ES-09-16-00 1327",

SCHMID, Associated Press Writer\n\n\n   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hurricane season is fast approaching and the\noutlook isn't pretty.\n\n\n   Federal storm specialists predicted an above-average storm\nseason Wednesday, calling for stronger, longer-lasting storms this\nyear, and more of them.\n\n\n   Hurricane season officially begins June 1, and the outlook is\nfor 11 tropical storms, seven of which will be hurricanes, three of\nthem major.\n\n\n   ''This puts coastal areas and the Caribbean islands at a much\nhigher risk of experiencing a tropical storm or hurricane,'' said\nD. James Baker, head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric\nAdministration.\n\n\n   The forecast is similar to last year's, which was followed by a\nseries of serious storms, including Hurricane Floyd, that caused\nmassive evacuations along the Southeastern coast and then inundated\nNorth Carolina.\n\n\n   The La Nina cooling of water in the Pacific Ocean, the same\ncondition that influenced the 1999 season, remains in place, Baker\nsaid.\n\n\n   ''For this reason we expect we'll have another major economic\nimpact on the United States,'' he said.\n\n\n   ''It's not just about the number'' of storms, added Max\nMayfield, director of the National Hurricane Center in Miami.\n''What really counts is where they make landfall and how strong\nthey are. Just one hurricane over your community makes it a very\nbad year.''\n\n\n   James Lee Witt, director of the Federal Emergency Management\nAgency, stressed the importance of having a plan and being prepared\nfor the storms. He cited community efforts, including Project\nImpact, which helps people strengthen their homes against storms of\nall types.\n\n\n   Baker and Witt signed a memorandum pledging to work closely\ntogether to warn people of impending storms and help them prepare.\n\n\n   ''It doesn't matter how good the forecast is if people don't\nplan in advance,'' said Jack Kelly, director of the National\nWeather Service.\n\n\n   Last year's evacuations left thousands of people trapped on\njammed highways for hours and the forecasters said that is a\nproblem they hope to avoid in the future. Coastal areas subject to\nflooding need to be evacuated in storms, but not every place that\nmerely expects wind damage, they said.\n\n\n   ''You flee from storm surge, you hide from wind,'' said\nMayfield, calling on people to get storm shutters, build safe rooms\nand take other steps to prepare their homes.\n\n\n   The new outlook from the government forecasters echoes that of\nBill Gray of Colorado State University, one of the few willing to\nmake long-range storm predictions. For this season he also\npredicted 11 named storms.\n\n\n   Mayfield was picked last week to replace the retired Jerry\nJarrell as director of the hurricane center.\n\n\n   Also last week a new weather satellite was launched that can be\npressed into service this summer if needed. The $220 million GOES-L\nsatellite had been delayed a year.\n\n\n   The forecasters rely on two Geostationary Operational\nEnvironmental Satellites to monitor tropical storms and other\nsevere weather. The East Coast's GOES-8, however, is a year beyond\nits design lifetime. Although still working, it could break down at\nany moment. GOES-L is a crucial backup.\n\n\n   While some climate experts have been blaming the increase in\ntropical storms in recent years on global warming, Gray says the\ntrend is cyclical and not related to warming.\n\n\n   Asked about this Wednesday, Baker agreed. ''We don't see, at\nthis point, a link between global warming and tropical cyclone\nactivity,'' he said.\n\n\n   Tropical cyclones is another name for hurricanes, which are also\ncalled typhoons in some parts of the world.\n\n\n   Over the last three decades forecasters have gotten better at\npredicting where the storms will go, researchers Colin McAdie and\nMiles Lawrence report in the May issue of the Bulletin of the\nAmerican Meteorological Society.\n\n\n   They found that from 1970 to 1998 track forecast errors\ndecreased by about 1 percent per year for the 24-hour forecast.\n\n\n   ''On a yearly basis, it's",

      "content": "REPEAT OF THE '38 HURRICANE WOULD BE MORE DAMAGING, LESS DEADLY \n\n\n\n   &UR;  &LR; BOSTON _ Nobody knew it was coming. The morning of Wednesday,\nSept. 21, 1938, dawned to cloudy skies and a forecast of rain, but\nnobody had the slightest clue that New England was about to get\nwalloped by a hurricane that for decades would rank as the most\ndamaging storm in the nation's history.\n\n\n   In a few brief hours, some rivers reached record flood levels. A\ngust of wind at the Blue Hill Observatory in Milton was measured at\n186 m.p.h.; for decades it was the second-highest wind speed ever\nrecorded on this planet. Phone and electric lines _ 20,000 miles of\nthem _ were knocked down, leaving seven-eighths of New England's\nhomes without power. Nearly 100 bridges washed out, and almost\n9,000 homes were destroyed. An estimated 275 million trees were\nsnapped or uprooted. And more than 600 people perished in the\nblinding wind, rain, and waves.\n\n\n   New Englanders abruptly learned the hard way that hurricanes\nwere not just a tropical concern.\n\n\n   Largely as a result, the region was far better prepared during\nlarge hurricanes that followed in the 40s and 50s, and today with\nimproved satellite systems and computer analysis there would be\nenough warning to avert most of the loss of life from a similar\nstorm. But the vast increase in development along the coast could\nmake the physical damage even greater.\n\n\n   Although the storm was considered unprecedented in 1938, it\nturned out that New England had been hit before, and would be hit\nmany times again _ though not in the 60 years since with such\nferocity.\n\n\n   Far more people _ an estimated 6,000 _ had died in the famous\nGalveston flood of 1900, which was caused by a hurricane that\noriginated in the same area off the coast of Africa; and the\nearthquake and fire that hit San Francisco in 1906 left more\nmemorable images of destruction and ruin; but nothing short of war\nhad ever caused as much devastation in this country as the\nhurricane of '38. And no storm on record anywhere in the world, up\nto that time, had caused so much damage.\n\n\n   Most weather forecasters at the time believed that hurricanes\nalways veered out to sea before they could strike the New England\ncoast, so even though this storm was being tracked as it moved\nrapidly northward _ much faster than most hurricanes do, sometimes\nat speeds exceeding 50 m.p.h. _ the official forecast from the\nNational Weather Bureau, even that morning, made no mention of a\nhurricane. It was just a run-of-the-mill storm warning.\n\n\n   Kerry Emanuel, professor of meteorology at the Massachusetts\nInstitute of Technology and a specialist in hurricane modelling,\nsays ``there was one renegade forecaster in Washington who thought\nit was going to hit New England, but nobody believed him.''\n\n\n   Charles Clark, acting chief of the Weather Bureau at the time,\nlater explained that the forecasters ``could hardly have given any\ngreater advance warning, for the tropical storm _ the worst in the\nhistory of the Northeast _ was a freak; it did not follow the usual\npattern...''\n\n\n   Later analysis of historical records made it clear that the\nstorm was not a freak. In fact, New England had suffered at least\ntwo equally devastating hurricanes: One in 1815, and, earlier, in\n1635, soon after the Mayflower colonists arrived.\n\n\n   Governor William Bradford wrote about the storm of 1635, calling\nit ``such a mighty storm of wind &AMP; raine, as none living in these\nparts, either English or Indeans, ever saw.'' He described it,\nquite accurately, as resembling the ``Haurricanes'' of the West\nIndies. He wrote that it blew down many hundred thousands of trees,\nand that ``the signs and marks of it will remaine this 100 years in\nthese parts where it was sorest.''\n\n\n   &UR;  &LR;  It was also described by Increase Mather as ``a most terrible\nstorm ... whereby we were in as much danger, as I think ever people\nwere.''\n\n\n   The great hurricane of 1815 was of similar scale, and by then\nthe region had been substantially built up, so the damage was more\ndevastating.

But they warned the storm could produce battering\nwaves, flash floods and mudslides -- and even strengthen again if it\nreaches the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n\n   The Florida Keys can expect a tropical storm warning or watch as\nearly as Thursday morning, officials said.\n\n\n   ''The main concern right now is for the Keys -- not for a\nhurricane, but for a tropical storm,'' said Max Mayfield, director\nof the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami.\n\n\n   Taking no chances, officials on Wednesday ordered visitors to\nevacuate the Keys and shut down all schools.\n\n\n   Cuba evacuated at least 3,000 people, including Haitians at a\nrefugee camp, from the eastern end of the island. Officials planned\nto evacuate thousands more -- including 700 tourists. Debby could\ndump up to 15 inches of rain over mountainous areas, and\nauthorities predicted widespread flooding.\n\n\n   In northern Haiti, shantytown dwellers fled their homes on\nTurtle Island and huddled in shelters in driving rain. The storm\nflooded homes in Port-de-Paix and ripped tin roofs off shacks.\nHaiti's deforested mountains were clearly a worry.\n\n\n   ''We're especially afraid of heavy rain washing down from the\nmountains. ... We don't have any canals, and flooding will cause a\nlot of damage,'' said Smith Joseph, a journalist at private Radio\nEtincelle in Port-de-Paix.\n\n\n   He said high winds sank a boat in the harbor at the nearby\ncoastal village of Carenage.\n\n\n   The Dominican Republic's emergency Civil Defense force said more\nthan 700 people in towns and cities on the north coast were forced\nout of their homes by flooding.\n\n\n   At 11 p.m. EDT Wednesday, Debby was centered off the northwest\ntip of Haiti over the Windward Passage. It was moving west near 16\nmph, headed for Cuba.\n\n\n   The storm should be over central Cuba by Thursday afternoon and\nthen move into the Gulf of Mexico, where it was expected to turn\nnorth, brushing the west coast of Florida.\n\n\n   Debby was downgraded from hurricane status Wednesday when it\nlost force in the mountains of Hispaniola. Still, workers in the\nDominican Republic evacuated dozens of people from riverside shacks\nand soldiers in the Bahamas deployed to several southern islands\nahead of the storm.\n\n\n   As a minor hurricane on Tuesday, Debby caused little damage to\nPuerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and small northeast Caribbean\nislands. On Tuesday, a 78-year-old man died in a suburb of San\nJuan, Puerto Rico's capital, when he slipped from his roof while\ntrying to dismantle an antenna.\n\n\n   ------\n\n\n   On the Net:\n\n\n   National Hurricane Center: http://www.nhc.noaa.gov\n\n\n   University of Puerto Rico's page: http://www.Upr.Clu.Edu/Nws\n\n\n AP-NY-08-24-00 0118",

Rain continued falling elsewhere and there was a \nchance of flooding in places plus isolated tornadoes. \n\n\n\tDamage was substantial in Falfurrias, about 60 miles southwest  \nof Corpus Christi, Mayor Michael Guerra said. \n\n\n\tThe eye passed over the town of about 5,800 residents about 3  \na.m., ripping roofs from homes and businesses, he said. Up to 90 \npercent of the town had no electricity, he said. \n\n\n\t``We have a lot of debris and live power lines in the roads, and  \nwe've had four convenience stores lose the canopies from their gas \npumps. And some of the less-structurally sound buildings have lost \nroofs and windows,'' he said. \n\n\n\tPower outages also were reported from the state's southern tip  \nnear Brownsville and McAllen to the counties surrounding Corpus \nChristi, said Jessica Mahaffey, spokeswoman for Central Power and \nLight Co. in Corpus Christi. The company serves much of South \nTexas. \n\n\n\t``The winds are still howling out there,'' Ms. Mahaffey said.  \nRepair crews have been working as wind conditions permit, and would \nbe joined by others today, she said. \n\n\n\tWorkers from federal and state agencies gathered this morning to  \nmove into the storm-blown areas to assess the damage. \n\n\n\tAs of 11 a.m. EDT today, Bret had top sustained wind of 45 mph  \nand some higher gusts, the National Hurricane Center said. The \nminimum for a hurricane is 74 mph. \n\n\n\tBret had been rated a Category 4 storm when it approached over  \nthe Gulf of Mexico with 140 mph wind, piling waves 26 feet high at \none offshore weather buoy, but made landfall with wind down to 125 \nmph. \n\n\n\tThis morning, the center of Bret moved across rural southern  \nTexas, going west-northwest at 6 mph. \n\n\n\tIt was expected to turn westward toward Mexico, where more than  \n3,500 people living near the Rio Grande in Nuevo Laredo, just \nacross the border from Laredo, Texas, had been evacuated because of \nthe possibility of flooding, the government news agency Notimex \nreported. \n\n\n\tOn Sunday, Bret unleashed its power on the deserted Padre Island  \nNational Seashore, 70 miles south of Corpus Christi, before \ncontinuing into desolate, sparsely populated ranch land. \n\n\n\tThousands of residents from Brownsville to Corpus Christi had  \nfled north and west as the hurricane approached. Windows throughout \nthe region were taped and boarded in anticipation of the worst \nstorm since Hurricane Allen, another Category 4 storm that struck \nroughly the same area in 1980, causing $55 million in damage. \n\n\n\t``I think it was overpublicized,'' said Ralph Huff, who defied  \nconventional wisdom -- and an evacuation order -- and stayed in his \ncinder block home overlooking Baffin Bay, just east of this small \nagricultural town. His phone and power were still working late \nSunday. \n\n\n\tEven though the storm's center passed less than 10 miles to the  \nsouth, ``there wasn't even any storm surge,'' he said. \n\n\n\tThe 125 mph wind, with gusts blowing even higher, extended 40  \nmiles out from the storm when it first hit land.

COASTLINE \n\n\n\n   WILMINGTON, N.C. _ The heart of Hurricane Floyd raked across the\nmainland here at Cape Fear Thursday morning, uprooting beach houses\nand leaving widespread floods as it set a rapid but steadily\nweakening course up the Atlantic coast.\n\n\n   The vast storm, whose advent alarmed much of the Eastern\nseaboard and widely disrupted air, rail and highway travel, was\nclearly losing its power with the dawn Thursday as the hurricane's\neye danced across the coastline following a two-week buildup of the\nforces of nature and the precautions of government.\n\n\n   By Thursday evening, as Floyd reached northeastward along the\nNew Jersey coast to New York City, its strength had further waned.\nIt was downgraded to a tropical storm that still delivered lashing\nrain but that officials said presented no major threat to New York\nor other population centers.\n\n\n   In the howling predawn of this coastal city, Floyd's power was\nmeasured to be dropping from a Category 4 to a Category 2 hurricane\nbefore dropping further to a tropical storm. While storm-drenched\nhurricane veterans were delighted after all the ominous evacuation\nwarnings that it delivered far less physical injury and property\ndestruction than originally feared, Floyd nevertheless proved\nrelentlessly drenching, dropping as much as 19 inches of rain in\nsome areas.\n\n\n   ``We were blessed this time,'' Fire Chief Keith Studt said as he\nroamed flooded streets and hacked away at fallen trees cluttering\nthe streets of nearby Winter Park. ``We were lucky this thing\nsuddenly ratcheted down before it hit town.''\n\n\n   Even so, the flooding and house damage out on Oak Island and\nother coastal barrier islands was considerable as the storm headed\nunpredictably northward, causing further disruption across a wide\nswath of the seaboard. Residents emerged uncertainly here from\nemergency centers to blink at piles of suddenly sun-dappled debris.\nBy then Floyd was speeding up along the coast by Virginia,\nChesapeake Bay and the New Jersey shore.\n\n\n   It lost further power but still spewed fresh damage along its\nwestern flank as the storm was described as fading into a rough\ncourse aimed toward eastern Long Island. But travel turmoil was\nwidespread during the day and quickly became bumper to bumper\naround Washington, as a truck overturned on the storm-lashed\nChesapeake Bay Bridge and blocked one of the major regional\narteries.\n\n\n   At least five fatalities across Floyd's path were listed\ntentatively as storm-related, but local residents here waited\nthrough a long night in fear of even worse things.\n\n\n   The storm's eye loomed out of the Atlantic's 30-foot seas as a\nsomewhat tentative invader, avoiding a deep inland attack and\ncutting across Cape Fear at 3:20 a.m. to begin a rapid ride up the\ncoastline. Open relief at the turning was the reaction from this\nstorm-hardened city, which has had to batten down for five\nhurricanes in the last three years.\n\n\n   ``It was merciful that it didn't come through at the 155 mph\nthey were first talking about,'' said James Blanton, hitching his\npickup truck's chain to a tree fallen across the road to his\ngranddaughter's house. ``That's what saved us, even with all this\nflooding.''\n\n\n   For a while, the storm registered sustained winds of 98 mph that\ngusted up to 130, tearing up the roof of the Brunswick County\nHospital to the south. There was some roof damage as well to\nWilmington's historic Cotton Exchange building, which is now a\nshopping mall centerpiece.\n\n\n   One unnerving accident was the draining of 2 million gallons\nfrom a hog waste lagoon into the Northeast Cape Fear River, about\n40 miles to the north.\n\n\n   But otherwise the storm caused minimal structural damage here,\nas in South Carolina.",

It was\nmoving west near 18 mph and was expected to keep that track through\nWednesday.\n\n\n   Winds were down to 60 mph and the U.S. National Hurricane Center\nsaid it was expected to get even weaker. Tropical storm-force winds\nextended 175 miles from the center.\n\n\n   Before dawn Wednesday, emergency workers from the Dominican\nCivil Defense woke up people living alongside rivers in the resort\ntown of Puerto Plata - fearing the rivers would overflow their\nbanks - and sent them to relatives or some of the 50 shelters.\nDeputy director Ojilbiz Mercado said 250 people were evacuated in\nPuerto Plata.\n\n\n   But Debby's strongest winds faced out to sea and it was hard to\ntell it was so close with the sun peeking occasionally through sun\nand drizzle.\n\n\n   In Cabarete resort village, 27-year-old Sandrine Kowalik of\nParis said the hurricane was making her vacation ''more exciting.''\n\n\n   ''It's something that we're not used to in France,'' she said as\nshe walked along a calm beach. ''It's a very small one, right?''\n\n\n   A 15-minute drive away, street vendor Placido Padilla, 53,\nwatched high waves breaking over garbage strewn on the beach less\nthan 100 feet from his home.\n\n\n   ''They should have brought the army in here because people don't\nwant to leave unless everbody leaves,'' he said.\n\n\n   The rain had caused open sewers to overflow into muddy roads\nwhere children played.\n\n\n   In Florida, emergency officials urged southern residents to pay\nclose attention to weather reports. ''We're like everybody else,''\nsaid Elizabeth Hirst, spokeswoman for Gov. Jeb Bush. ''In the\nwait-and-see mode.''\n\n\n   South Floridians stuffed shopping carts with bottled water,\ncanned food, milk, batteries and other emergency supplies - just in\ncase.\n\n\n   ''It's good to be prepared because even if the hurricane doesn't\nhit, we may still get blackouts,'' said Clara Milanes, 64.\n\n\n   Forecasters said they may post a hurricane watch in south\nFlorida on Wednesday.\n\n\n   Hurricane warnings were posted for the Turks and Caicos, the\nsoutheastern Bahamas and the northern Dominican Republic. Cuba\nposted a hurricane watch for its north coast and added parts of the\nsouth coast on Wednesday. A hurricane watch was in effect for the\nrest of the Bahamas and northern Haiti.\n\n\n   As a relatively minor hurricane on Tuesday, Debby brought some\nrain and little apparent damage to the U.S. territories of Puerto\nRico and the U.S. Virgin Islands and a number of small islands such\nas Antigua and Anguilla.\n\n\n   ''This storm was quite confusing in terms of all the various\nchanges it made,'' said Gene Walker, head of the Virgin Islands'\nemergency response agency.

Vieques is the site of\nrecurrent protests over military exercises.\n\n\n   The fourth named storm of the Atlantic season emerged with\nunnerving suddenness as the season's first threat to land.\n\n\n   At 8 p.m. EDT, Debby was centered about 115 miles east-southeast\nof Antigua, heading for French, Dutch and British islands overnight\nand expected to continue onto the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto\nRico Tuesday and then the Dominican Republic.

This is the third\ntime one of these storms has done this to me.''\n\n\n   Luckily for most everyone else, Crisp was in the minority\nThursday, one of the few with the unpleasant task of counting their\nlosses rather than their blessings.\n\n\n   When Hurricane Bonnie churned through the Atlantic Ocean off the\nNorth Carolina coast three days ago, it was a Category 3 storm 400\nmiles wide with winds of 115 mph. Many feared it would cause severe\ndamage to an area that had barely begun to heal from the last big\nstorm.\n\n\n   But as it weakened to a tropical storm and headed out to sea\nThursday, state officials expressed relief that damage to\nstructures, to fragile beaches, to trees, to power lines were all\nbeing tallied in the ``minor'' column.\n\n\n   Above all, they were elated that Bonnie had caused no loss of\nlife or serious injuries.\n\n\n   ``That's amazing, really,'' said Susan Perkins, a spokeswoman\nfor the state division of emergency management. ``People here are\nsurprised and happy.''\n\n\n   Bonnie was downgraded to a tropical storm in the early afternoon\nThursday after coming ashore 24 hours earlier near Cape Fear and\nthen tracking slowly up the North Carolina coast, dumping sheets of\nrain. Wilmington, the biggest city in its path, received upward of\n8 inches, and forecasters had predicted as much as 20 inches could\nfall.\n\n\n   The fact that Bonnie was moving so slowly, anywhere between 4\nmph and 8 mph after landfall, led officials to express concern that\nsevere flooding would occur. And while the rain did fall in sheets,\nthe only significant flooding occurred along the banks of the\nPamlico River near the city of Washington, and it was caused by\nstorm surge, not rain.\n\n\n   Because they are still so fresh in the minds of many residents\nhere, Bonnie was often compared to hurricanes Fran and Bertha,\nwhich struck in 1996\n\n\n   Fran and Bertha both sent water into the basement of dentist\nJeff Rumley's house on the Pamlico River, a house built in 1874 by\na North Carolina lumber baron and which, presumably, has weathered\nmany such storms. Bonnie failed to measure up to her predecessors.\n\n\n   ``This was nothing like it was with Fran,'' Rumley said. ``This\n(water) came in real slow and it's starting to leave real fast. It\ndidn't push in like Frank and break things as it went. It just rose\nreal slowly.''\n\n\n   About 80 miles away, near Cape Carteret, Claude Murdoch, a\n67-year-old, ``semi-retired'' mechanic had already mopped the mud\noff the floor of his modest house on the shores of the Intracoastal\nWaterway. The flood damage to his place was also the result of\nstorm surge, which had further damaged the pier he is trying to\nbuild that keeps getting torn up by hurricanes.\n\n\n   ``Me and her (his wife Jessie B. Murdoch), we mopped it real\ngood,'' Murdoch said as the winds whipped the sound behind him into\ndancing whitecaps. ``She's got cancer real bad. I still got damage\nfrom Fran I ain't ever fixed. I would have if I didn't have to work\nto pay for her radiation treatments.''\n\n\n   By later afternoon, convoys of power company trucks headed into\nthe hurricane area from their staging area in Raleigh, ready to\nrestore power to the 250,000 people still without it. Convoys of\nNational Guard troops also were headed to the coast to offer their\nassistance.\n\n\n   President Clinton on Thursday declared 10 North Carolina\ncounties disaster areas, an act that opens the federal financial\nspigots and which will help those whose property was damaged by the\nstorm.\n\n\n   North Carolina Gov.

(AP) -- Heavy rain began falling along the Gulf Coast\non Saturday as Hurricane Gordon bore down on central Florida. The\nstorm had deluged Cuba with up to 10 inches of rain before reaching\nhurricane strength with 75 mph winds Saturday.\n\n\n   Gordon was expected to strike land between Fort Myers and the\nPanhandle sometime late Sunday. But its unpredictability and\ndirection changes left forecasters urging all coastal areas from\nFlorida to Alabama to closely monitor its progress.\n\n\n   Florida Gov. Jeb Bush put emergency response teams on standby\nSaturday, and in some counties, disaster officials recommended\nvoluntary evacuation of barrier islands and areas prone to\nflooding. Coastal areas were told to anticipate a storm surge.\n\n\n   ''It's gonna be a nuisance, bringing a lot of rain, possible\nflooding along the Gulf Coast with storm surge and possible\ntornadoes,'' said Chris Robbins, a meteorologist at the National\nHurricane Center in Miami.\n\n\n   The center's tropical storm warning Saturday covered a 210-mile\nstretch from Bonita Beach, just south of Fort Myers, to the\nSuwannee River, about 100 miles north of Tampa.\n\n\n   A hurricane watch was issued for a 400-mile stretch from Bonita\nBeach to the Panhandle town of Apalachicola. The watch means a\nstorm with winds of 74 mph or greater could hit within the next 36\nhours.\n\n\n   As skies grayed over the Tampa Bay area Saturday, people didn't\nseem too concerned about the approaching storm. Along Clearwater\nBeach, only a few homeowners had boarded up their windows.\n\n\n   Joel Nava of Tampa and Jim Phillips of Clearwater bought 15\n50-pound bags of potting soil to use as sandbags. Both live in low\nlying areas and said they planned to barricade their front doorways\nwith the potting soil to keep flood water out.\n\n\n   Richard Lehfeldt recently moved to Tampa from New York City and\nwasn't sure what to expect. He bought plastic weatherproofing to\ncover windows of his house, duct tape, batteries and flashlights --\njust in case. ''I'll secure parts of the house that are vulnerable,\nthen watch TV,'' he said.\n\n\n   Robbins, the meteorologist, said people shouldn't panic.\n\n\n   ''It is a minimal hurricane,'' he said. ''Of course, I don't\nwant to minimize its importance.''\n\n\n   Saturday evening, Gordon was about 235 miles southwest of Tampa\nand moving north-northeast at about 12 mph, a slight shift to the\nnorth from earlier in the day when the storm was headed\nnortheasterly.\n\n\n   Two to five inches of rain were expected to fall across parts of\nSouth Florida and the Keys on Saturday.\n\n\n   Disaster officials in Hernando, Manatee and Pinellas counties\ntold residents who wanted to leave to start packing and that\nshelters would be opened in the evening. Other counties were\nawaiting later forecasts before deciding whether to advise\nevacuation.\n\n\n   Across the state on the Atlantic Coast, NASA considered moving\nthe space shuttle Discovery off its seaside launch pad at Cape\nCanaveral and into its hangar. Discovery is scheduled to blast off\nOct. 5 on a space station construction mission.\n\n\n   A Sunday baseball game between Oakland and Tampa was also\npostponed as a precaution.\n\n\n   In addition to Gordon's rainfall in Cuba early Saturday, the\nstorm pounded Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula on Friday, causing street\nflooding in the resort city of Cancun.\n\n\n   In the Atlantic, wind blew across Bermuda at 60 mph early\nSaturday as Hurricane Florence passed north of the island. There\nwas no damage or flooding, said James Buxton, meteorologist with\nthe Bermuda Weather Service. Florence, down-graded to a tropical\nstorm, was 510 miles southeast of Halifax, Nova Scotia, Saturday\nevening with sustained winds of 70 mph and was expected to pass\nnear eastern Newfoundland on Sunday.\n\n\n   Rip currents associated with Florence were blamed for at least\nthree surf deaths Tuesday in North Carolina.\n\n\n   Near its center, Florence still packed hurricane force winds of\n80 mph but some weakening was forecast in the next day and the\nstorm",

I\nthink we are in it now.''\n\n\n   The numbers bear him out: 1995 to 1998 was the most active\nfour-year stretch on record, spawning 53 named storms in the\nAtlantic basin, with 33 hurricanes and 15 of those reaching major\nstatus. Storms are named when winds reach 39 mph, become hurricanes\nat 74 mph and are deemed major at 111 mph.\n\n\n   Many of the long-term predictions are based on research by\nWilliam Gray, a Colorado State University forecaster who tracks\ntropical systems and the forces that create them.\n\n\n   Gray's 1999 forecast, which will be updated this week, calls for\n14 named Atlantic storms this year, with 10 reaching hurricane\nstrength and four growing into major storms.\n\n\n   Perhaps most worrisome: Because of a complex mix of factors,\nGray thinks the Gulf Coast has a 150 percent greater chance of\nbeing hit by a major storm than in a statistically average year,\nwhile the Atlantic Coast has double the chance.\n\n\n   Powerful storms like Opal and last year's Mitch and Georges have\nalways done the most damage. But unlike the last period of high\nhurricane activity, from roughly 1940 to 1960, the population of\nthe nation's eastern coastline has swelled.\n\n\n   ``There's such a buildup of population and property values along\nthe Southeastern coast,'' Gray told The Associated Press. ``You're\ngoing to see hurricane damage like you've never previously seen it\nbecause there's just so much more there.''\n\n\n   Panhandle residents know about the damage firsthand.\n\n\n   Hit by powerful Hurricane Frederic in 1979, the region escaped\nmajor hurricane damage the next 15 years, which also was a time of\nunprecedented growth. High-rise condos, golf resorts, marinas and\nnew neighborhoods sprouted from Gulf Shores, Ala., to Panama City\nBeach, Fla. Even the long-neglected Mississippi coast boomed in the\n1990s with the advent of casinos.\n\n\n   The hurricane drought ended in 1995, when Erin slashed across\nthe region, leaving significant damage. Four months later Opal\nroared ashore with winds approaching 150 mph, leveling homes,\ntearing up docks, snapping power lines and eating away dunes.\n\n\n   Last year, first Earl and then Georges came calling, once again\nfilling streets with sand, blowing out windows and undermining\nfoundations. Georges also pummeled several Caribbean islands and\nthe Florida Keys.\n\n\n   The repeated storms scoured away sand dunes along much of the\nGulf Coast, leaving buildings exposed to sea water. Governments\nscrambled to rebuild the dunes, pumping sand from offshore, setting\nup sand fences and planting sea oats to hold the dunes in place.\n\n\n   But the work can't compare to the slow, natural process of dune\nbuilding.\n\n\n   ``Our sand dunes used to be so high you couldn't even see the\nwater from here,'' Clark said, pointing out his office window to a\npool deck that drops directly to a flat beach. ``They renourished\nour beach after Opal, but last year Georges took all that sand\noffshore. Now there's nothing out there to protect us.''\n\n\n   Gray thinks the weather patterns that control hurricanes have\nshifted, part of a long-term cycle that s",

Most schools and government offices were closed Monday.\n\n\n   Georges was the second storm in three weeks to cause relatively\nmodest damage to the area. Hurricane Earl brought category 1, 80\nmph winds to Panama City Beach Sept. 3 before shattering into a\ntropical storm shortly after landfall.\n\n\n   Neither Earl nor George appeared to have caused nearly the\ndamage brought by the back-to-back hurricanes of Erin and Opal\nthree years ago.\n\n\n   By Monday afternoon, the Pensacola area began to return to\nnormal, as winds subsided but the steady rain continued.\n\n\n   The Pensacola Bay Bridge _ linking the mainland with Gulf Breeze\n_ opened in the afternoon. The Bob Sikes Bridge, connecting Gulf\nBreeze with the beaches, was opened till early evening for\nresidents.\n\n\n   Some low-lying streets in downtown Pensacola flooded after more\nthan 15 inches of rain fell and another 10 inches could come today,\nsaid Suzanne Kahn, spokeswoman for the Escambia County Emergency\nOperations Center.\n\n\n   Kahn said the dunes were breached in some spots.\n\n\n   A tornado-like waterspout Monday came ashore near Panama City\nBeach, nearly 200 miles east of Pensacola, and destroyed five homes\nand damaged seven, but no one was injured, said Bay County\nspokesman Charles Goodman.\n\n\n   A fire late Sunday took the life of a Pensacola woman in the\nmidst of heavy rain and tropical storm-force winds. Pensacola\npolice said the woman, Ruby Lee Pittiway, 66, is believed to have\nbeen lighting a candle when her house caught fire. There was no\npower at the time because of Georges.\n\n\n   Also in Pensacola, the roof of a downtown building caved in\nwhile three other structures suffered lesser damage, including\nbroken windows at McGuire's Irish Pub, one of the city's best-known\nrestaurants.\n\n\n   National Guard troops worked Sunday night and early Monday, at\nthe storm's height, to rescue more than 200 people stranded in\ntheir homes by flash floods.\n\n\n   The Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\n\n   Story Filed By Cox Newspapers\n\n\n   For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service",

The Bahamas Air-Sea Rescue Association said\nsome U.S. yachters had turned back to Florida.\n\t   The islands' meteorological department said Bonnie would have\nthe greatest effect on San Salvador island, which could see five to\n10 inches of rain, while more populated areas, including the\ncapital of Nassau, were unlikely to suffer as much from the storm.\n\t   Three inches of rain was reported in the Turks and Caicos\nIslands at the southeast end of the Bahamas chain.\n\t   Saturday evening, the hurricane warning was discontinued in the\nTurks and Caicos and was downgraded to a tropical storm warning in\nthe southeastern Bahamas.\n\t   North Florida is the most likely target to be hit if the storm\nreaches the mainland. Still, the storm could veer out to sea and\nmiss the U.S. coast entirely, Jarrell said.\n\t   Meanwhile, another weather system that threatened parts of Texas\nlost power Saturday.\n\t   All warnings were discontinued when Tropical Storm Charley\nweakened to a depression, though the hurricane center warned small\nvessels to remain in port along the northwestern Gulf of Mexico\nuntil winds and waves that reached 10 feet (3 meters) subside.\n\t   The threat of heavy rains and a storm forced the evacuation of\nthousands of people from oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\t   As it moved into Texas, Matagorda Island was hit the hardest\nwith 9 inches (23 centimeters) of rain and 70 mph (110 kph) wind\ngusts early Saturday.",

(AP) - Most of the 800 residents in this rustic\nfishing town stayed put Sunday evening as Tropical Storm Gordon,\nwith winds just below hurricane strength, plowed into central\nFlorida's Gulf Coast.\n\n\n   Drenching rain, a storm surge with waves over 6 feet high and\nwind gust of up to 60 mph pounded this barrier reef about 100 miles\nnorth of Tampa. Gordon, with top sustained winds near 70 mph, made\nlandfall at about 8 p.m. Sunday EDT.\n\n\n   No injuries or deaths were reported as of early Monday as the\nsystem began making its way across Florida. The storm's forecast\ntrack had it moving over coastal Georgia and the Carolinas.\n\n\n   About 200 Florida National Guardsmen were activated and field\nteams were deployed to assess damage at first daylight. State\nofficials announced that schools in Columbia, Taylor, Citrus and\nGilchrist counties would be closed Monday.\n\n\n   At 2 a.m. EDT, Gordon's center was near 29.8 north latitude,\n82.8 west longitude, or about 30 miles west-northwest of\nGainesville. The storm was moving north-northeast near 12 mph with\ntop sustained winds near 50 mph, but was forecast to weaken as it\ntravels overland.\n\n\n   A voluntary evacuation had been recommended in Cedar Key before\nthe storm came ashore, but many residents preferred to wait out the\nstorm at home.\n\n\n   ''Their words are like, 'We've always stayed, we're staying this\ntime,''' Mayor Heath Davis said.\n\n\n   The storm knocked out electricity to much of the city earlier\nSunday, but most residents had power restored by midnight. Debris\nand broken tree limbs littered the empty streets.\n\n\n   ''It was a pleasant surprise because it could have gotten\nstronger out there,'' said Dan Sandsler, 41, whose family owns a\nwaterfront restaurant and bar. ''It was disorganized before it got\nhere, so we kind of dodged the bullet here.''\n\n\n   A total of about 121,000 homes throughout the state were hit\nwith power outages, as leading bands of the storm brought heavy\nrains ashore over central Florida's Gulf Coast. The state's two\nlargest utilities were working to restore power to customers Sunday\nevening.\n\n\n   Flooding was reported in southwest Florida, said Michael Loehr,\noperations chief for the State Emergency Operations Center.\n\n\n   ''We've already gotten calls from Charlotte County saying\nthey've got houses on the coast where you open the front door, the\nwater's coming in; you open the back door, water's going out,'' he\nsaid.\n\n\n   Gordon's top sustained winds fell from 75 mph early Sunday to\nabout 70 mph by late afternoon, just below the 74 mph threshold for\na hurricane.\n\n\n   The storm weakened as it neared land and also pulled in dry air\nfrom the Gulf of Mexico and southeastern United States, said Hugh\nCobb, a meteorologist at the National Hurricane Center in Miami.\n\n\n   ''We came out good I think, we were very fortunate,'' said\nFrances Nesbitt, a Cedar Keys real estate agent. ''I'm not for\nhurricanes by any means, but Florida's been having a drought. The\nonly good thing it does, it raises the water level.''\n\n\n   Forecasters said a storm surge of 5 to 8 feet would lessen by\nMonday morning. Cedar Key sits two to three feet above sea level.\n\n\n   There was a threat of isolated tornadoes near the east coast of\nGeorgia on Monday morning, forecasters said. At least one tornado\nwas reported Sunday evening in Palm Beach County, the National\nWeather Service said.\n\n\n   State officials reported about 750 people were taking advantage\nof shelters around the state, dozens of flights were canceled at\nTampa International Airport, and the Tampa Bay Devil Rays baseball\ngame with the Oakland A's was called off.\n\n\n   Evacuations were ordered for low-lying areas and mobile home\nparks in Citrus and Taylor Counties north of Tampa, and five\ncounties - Pinellas, Hillsborough, Manatee, Hernando and Pasco -\nwere under voluntary evacuation.\n\n\n   A tropical storm warning was still in effect for the Florida\nGulf Coast from Anclote Key to St. Marks, and on the Atlantic coast\nfrom Flagl",

The highway had been open \nto residents with four-wheel-drive vehicles, but was closed again \nSaturday afternoon as the wind increased and torrential rain \nflooded the island. \n\n\n\tAs the storm moved inland Saturday evening, 80 people took  \nshelter at Pamlico County Community College in Grantsboro, said Tim \nHarvey, the county's emergency management coordinator.",

Tourists crowded airports to flee\nthe storm and airlines began canceling flights. Cruise ships turned\naway from the winds and rain.\n\n\n   Ten ships and two submarines in the USS Harry Truman battle\ngroup abandoned training exercises off Vieques island and moved 300\nmiles south of Puerto Rico, the Navy said.

Forecasters said it was too early to say whether the\nstorm could threaten the U.S. mainland.\n\n\n   Debby seemingly came out of nowhere Saturday and reached\nnear-hurricane strength in little more than a day. Its sustained\nwinds reached 75 mph early Tuesday, past the 74 miles per hour to\nbe classified as a hurricane.\n\n\n   Debby was churning west-northwest at about 20 mph, especially\nfast for such a storm, and was expected to intensify and keep on\nthe same track for the next three days. The weather service said\nwinds were expected to reach about 86 mph.\n\n\n   Hurricane warnings were posted from the French island of\nGuadeloupe north through the island chain including Dutch St.\nMaarten, Saba, and St. Eustatius, through the British and U.S.\nVirgin Islands and Puerto Rico. The Dominican Republic went on\nstorm watch Monday night.\n\n\n   In volcano-plagued Montserrat, British Gov. Anthony Abbott\nwarned in a radio broadcast that ''There's a possibility that Debby\ncould pass right over Montserrat.''\n\n\n   Stormy weather likely would cause mudflows of volcanic debris\ndown the Belham River, the Montserrat Volcano Observatory warned,\nthough that area has been in the restricted danger zone.\n\n\n   Meteorologists in Antigua warned their residents to prepare for\na direct hit.\n\n\n   Electricity on some parts of Antigua went out, apparently turned\noff to avoid storm damage. Motorists lined up for gas, and\nemergency specialists warned people living in roofless homes\nunrepaired since last year's hurricanes to get ready to head to\nshelters.\n\n\n   A flight by a hurricane hunter airplane Monday morning showed\nDebby was outpacing even the experts' forecasts.\n\n\n   ''It's moving faster and it's also more intense than we had\nthought,'' Laskosky said.\n\n\n   In the twin-island nation of St. Kitts and Nevis, Debby\nthreatened to soak Carifesta, a 35-nation arts and music festival\nthat began Thursday.\n\n\n   Carnival Cruise Lines said it was diverting three of its ships\nnow in the eastern Caribbean to areas further north, west and south\nto avoid the storm.\n\n\n   In the U.S. Virgin Islands, the National Park Service shut down\nits grounds on the island of St. John.

Tourists crowded airports to flee\nthe storm and airlines began canceling flights. Cruise ships turned\naway from the winds and rain.\n\n\n   Ten ships and two submarines in the USS Harry Truman battle\ngroup abandoned training exercises off Vieques island and moved 300\nmiles south of Puerto Rico, the Navy said. Vieques is the site of\nrecurrent protest over military exercises.\n\n\n   The fourth named storm of the Atlantic season emerged with\nunnerving suddenness as the season's first threat to land, with\nfears that it could directly hit the Puerto Rican capital of San\nJuan around noon Tuesday.\n\n\n   At 2 a.m. EDT Tuesday, Debby was just southeast of the island of\nBarbuda in the northern Leeward Islands, heading for French, Dutch\nand British islands overnight and expected to continue onto the\nU.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico and then the Dominican\nRepublic. Forecasters said it was too early to say whether the\nstorm could threaten the U.S. mainland.\n\n\n   Debby seemingly came out of nowhere Saturday and reached\nnear-hurricane strength in little more than a day. Its sustained\nwinds reached 75 mph early Tuesday, past the 74 miles per hour to\nbe classified as a hurricane.\n\n\n   Debby was churning west-northwest at about 20 mph, especially\nfast for such a storm, and was expected to intensify and keep on\nthe same track for the next three days. The weather service said\nwinds were expected to reach about 86 mph.\n\n\n   Hurricane warnings were posted from the French island of\nGuadeloupe north through the island chain including Dutch St.\nMaarten, Saba, and St. Eustatius, through the British and U.S.\nVirgin Islands and Puerto Rico. The Dominican Republic went on\nstorm watch Monday night.\n\n\n   In volcano-plagued Montserrat, British Gov.

      "content": "BEFORE THE STORM COMES THE CALM \n\n\n\n   SARASOTA, Fla. _ Hey, Gert, Jose and Katrina, where are you?\n\n\n   Despite predictions of a busy hurricane season, it's been a\nfizzle so far. So the question is: Were the forecasters way off?\n\n\n   Their advice: Don't start digging into the canned tuna in your\nhurricane supplies just yet.\n\n\n   ``Two words: last year,'' said hurricane forecaster Jack Beven\nof the National Hurricane Center in Miami. ``Last year this time,\nAlex, our first tropical storm, was forming. And later on we had 10\nstorms in 33 days.''\n\n\n   Colorado State University professor Bill Gray predicted at the\nstart of the June-through-November hurricane season that 1999 might\nbe a repeat of last year, which produced a bumper crop of violent\nstorms.\n\n\n   There were 14 tropical storms in 1998, 10 of which intensified\ninto hurricanes.\n\n\n   Gray and his research team said in June that conditions were\nright for 14 storms this season. If he's right _ and he often is _\nwe'll be closely watching storms named Gert, Jose, Katrina and many\nmore.\n\n\n   But so far there's only been tropical storm Arlene, which\nbypassed Bermuda in mid-June.\n\n\n   Chris Landsea, a hurricane researcher for the National Oceanic\nand Atmospheric Association and a former student of Gray's, says\nthe slow start to this year's hurricane season isn't unusual.\n\n\n   ``The historical average is one and a half tropical storms\nforming by Aug. 1, so it's pretty close to average,'' he said last\nweek.\n\n\n   He said a slow start doesn't indicate that the season will be an\ninactive one.\n\n\n   In 1984 and 1988, the first hurricane didn't form until\nSeptember. Diana and Debby were the fourth tropical storms in those\nyears, but the first ones that developed hurricane-force winds of\nat least 74 mph. Both 1984 and 1988 produced 12 tropical storms,\nfive of which became hurricanes.\n\n\n   Nine tropical storms develop in an average year, with six of\nthem becoming hurricanes.\n\n\n   ``If anything, the slow start of the storms forming in the\nsubtropics is a sign that it could be busier than usual later on,''\nLandsea said.\n\n\n   ``It would be nice if the ones that form in the subtropics were\nforming more regularly, but they're not. It's another sign that\nlater on, the Cape Verde season could be a nasty one in 1999.''\n\n\n   Storms referred to as Cape Verde storms develop near the Cape\nVerde islands off the west coast of Africa and often become the\nbiggest and fiercest storms of the hurricane season as they gain\nstrength sweeping across the Atlantic. They can scour the Caribbean\nislands, strike the United States or Mexican mainland, or curve\nharmlessly into the North Atlantic.\n\n\n   Hurricane activity peaks in mid-September. August, September and\nOctober are the three most active months, with 90 percent of all\nstorms occurring in those months, Landsea said.\n\n\n   Gray will update his forecast Friday, and the NOAA plans to\nreassess the hurricane season next Monday.\n\n\n   But Landsea said he sees no obvious reasons to scrap the\nforecast for an active season that he and Gray predicted. Beven,\nwith the National Hurricane Center, agrees that conditions still\nappear favorable for an above-normal hurricane season.\n\n\n   A key factor is La Nina, the abnormal cooling of water in\nequatorial Pacific waters. La Nina is expected to promote hurricane\ndevelopment through the remainder of the year. Another factor Gray\ntakes into account is a high-pressure ridge in the North Atlantic,\nwhich also promotes hurricane formation.\n\n\n   (The Herald-Tribune in Sarasota, Fla., is part of the New York\nTimes Regional Newspaper Group.)",

The methods rely on satellites\nset up to measure various types of energy reflected by storm\nclouds: microwave, infrared or visible light. Since 1978, the\nresearchers have collected satellite data, largely over the United\nStates, that allow them to relate these energy levels to the\namounts of rain measured below the clouds by rain gauges and radar.\nThey say that the satellite estimates fall within 25 percent to 50\npercent of the rain gauge results.\n\n\n   Even with such a large margin of error, the satellite estimates\nare better than nothing in areas without rain gauges, like remote\nmountainous regions where some of the heaviest rain occurs and\nwhere floods originate.\n\n\n   The information can be made available within minutes after\ncollection and can therefore be used to provide warnings of flash\nfloods and to assist in relief efforts.",

      "content": "HURRICANE LOSING POWER AFTER GLANCING N.C. COASTLINE \n\n\n\n   WILMINGTON, N.C. _ The heart of Hurricane Floyd raked across the\nmainland here at Cape Fear Thursday morning, uprooting beach houses\nand leaving widespread floods as it set a rapid but steadily\nweakening course up the Atlantic coast.\n\n\n   The vast storm, whose advent alarmed much of the Eastern\nseaboard and widely disrupted air, rail and highway travel, was\nclearly losing its power with the dawn Thursday as the hurricane's\neye danced across the coastline following a two-week buildup of the\nforces of nature and the precautions of government.\n\n\n   By Thursday evening, as Floyd reached northeastward along the\nNew Jersey coast to New York City, its strength had further waned.\nIt was downgraded to a tropical storm that still delivered lashing\nrain but that officials said presented no major threat to New York\nor other population centers.\n\n\n   At least 10 deaths were attributed to Floyd. Seven people died\nin traffic in the Carolinas and Virginia and two girls in Delaware\ndrowned after a storm-swollen creek swept them into a sewage pipe.\nOne man was presumed drowned in the Bahamas.\n\n\n   In the howling predawn of this coastal city, Floyd's power was\nmeasured to be dropping from a Category 4 to a Category 2 hurricane\nbefore dropping further to a tropical storm. While storm-drenched\nhurricane veterans were delighted after all the ominous evacuation\nwarnings that it delivered far less physical injury and property\ndestruction than originally feared, Floyd nevertheless proved\nrelentlessly drenching, dropping as much as 19 inches of rain in\nsome areas.\n\n\n   ``We were blessed this time,'' Fire Chief Keith Studt said as he\nroamed flooded streets and hacked away at fallen trees cluttering\nthe streets of nearby Winter Park. ``We were lucky this thing\nsuddenly ratcheted down before it hit town.''\n\n\n   Even so, the flooding and house damage out on Oak Island and\nother coastal barrier islands was considerable as the storm headed\nunpredictably northward, causing further disruption across a wide\nswath of the seaboard. Residents emerged uncertainly here from\nemergency centers to blink at piles of suddenly sun-dappled debris.\nBy then Floyd was speeding up along the coast by Virginia,\nChesapeake Bay and the New Jersey shore.\n\n\n   It lost further power but still spewed fresh damage along its\nwestern flank as the storm was described as fading into a rough\ncourse aimed toward eastern Long Island. But travel turmoil was\nwidespread during the day and quickly became bumper to bumper\naround Washington, as a truck overturned on the storm-lashed\nChesapeake Bay Bridge and blocked one of the major regional\narteries.\n\n\n   On St. Michael's, a resort and retirement village on an\nelbowlike peninsula reaching into Chesapeake Bay, the day's rain\nand winds started turning savage in midafternoon as the eye of the\nstorm approached.\n\n\n   Lawrence Murphy is a netter, who fishes with nets attached to\npoles. He left two, $10,000 polenets standing in the bay, where he\nassumed they would be safe from a northeaster.\n\n\n   ``But it's coming from the northwest,'' Murphy said. He said his\nnets had withstood 40-mph winds. ``But this was 60 or 70,'' he\nsaid, figuring his rigs were lost. ``The netters are caught real\nbad.''\n\n\n   The storm's eye loomed out of the Atlantic's 30-foot seas as a\nsomewhat tentative invader, avoiding a deep inland attack and\ncutting across Cape Fear at 3:20 a.m. to begin a rapid ride up the\ncoastline. Open relief at the turning was the reaction from this\nstorm-hardened city, which has had to batten down for five\nhurricanes in the last three years.\n\n\n   ``It was merciful that it didn't come through at the 155 mph\nthey were first talking about,'' said James Blanton, hitching his\npickup truck's chain to a tree fallen across the road to his\ngranddaughter's house. ``That's what saved us, even with all this\nflooding.''\n\n\n   For a while, the storm registered sustained winds of 98 mph that\ngusted up to 130, tearing up the roof of the Brunswick County\nHospital to the south. There was some roof damage",

The southeastern portion (of\nthe Bahamas) is going to be hit today,'' meteorologist Dave Chorney\nsaid from the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami.\n\t   Bonnie nearly stalled Saturday about 115 miles (185 kilometers)\nnorth-northeast of the British Turk island, drenching it and the\nnearby Bahamian island of Mayaguana with heavy rains carried by\ngusty winds, residents said.\n\t   On Crooked Island, fuel distributor Daisy Scavella said the sun\nwas shining Saturday morning as residents battened down windows.\n\t   ``I guess we're going to have a good blow,'' she said. People on\nthe low-lying islands were most concerned about flooding. Bahamian\nforecaster Basil Dean said the islands already were experiencing\nhigher-than-usual tides that Bonnie's storm surges could rise\nanother 3 to 7 feet (a meter to two meters).\n\t   Bahamian radio warned the islands' fishing fleet and yachters to\nmake for safe port. The Bahamas Air-Sea Rescue Association said\nsome U.S. yachters had turned back to Florida.\n\t   The islands' meteorological department said Bonnie would hit\nlandfall in the southeast later Saturday and pass by Long Island,\nEleuthera and the Abacos on Sunday and Monday.\n\t   ``People along the southeastern U.S. should pay attention to its\nprogress,'' said Jerry Jarrell, director of National Hurricane\nCenter.\n\t   He said Bonnie was packing sustained winds of 85 mph (140 kph)\nthat could reach 100 mph (160 kph) by Monday and eventually upgrade\nto a Category 3 storm with winds more than 111 mph (178 kph)\ncapable of causing extensive damage. Chorney noted that the worst\nthunderstorms were on the northern side of the system, in the open\nAtlantic.\n\t   Bonnie was expected to resume its north-northwest tack and move\nat 10-15 mph (16-24 kph) on Sunday, the hurricane center said.\n\t   The Bahamian government Saturday posted a hurricane watch for\nthe northwest islands and hurricane warnings covered the British\nTurks and Caicos islands and the southeastern and central Bahamas.\n\t   ``Preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to\ncompletion,'' the hurricane center urged.\n\t   North Florida is the most likely target to be hit if the storm\nreaches the mainland. Still, the storm could veer out to sea and\nmiss the U.S. coast entirely, Jarrell said.\n\t   Meanwhile, another weather system that threatened parts of Texas\nlost power Saturday.\n\t   All warnings were discontinued when Tropical Storm Charley\nweakened to a depression, though the hurricane center warned small\nvessels to remain in port along the northwestern Gulf of Mexico\nuntil winds and waves that reached 10 feet (3 meters) subside.\n\t   The threat of heavy rains and a storm forced the evacuation of\nthousands of people from oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\t   As it moved into Texas, Matagorda Island was hit the hardest\nwith 9 inches (23 centimeters) of rain and 70 mph (110 kph) wind\ngusts early Saturday.\n\t   Also Friday, a storm in the Pacific Ocean reached hurricane\nstrength but remained far off the Mexican coast.\n\t   Hurricane Howard intensified Saturday, with winds of 110 mph\n(176 kph). The hurricane center said it was expected to become\nstronger before dissipating in the Pacific later Sunday.\n\t   Authorities closed the Acapulco port and warned ships to be\ncautious of high waves along the southwestern Mexican coast.\n\t   The Atlantic Basin typically has nine tropical storms each year\nwith six of them becoming hurricanes, two of them intense.

But a weakness in the ridge\nover the Bahamas could allow the storm to veer more northward by\nThursday.\n\n\n   ``It's just too early to tell,'' Williams said.\n\n\n   Local and state emergency management officials moved to a state\nof watchful waiting Tuesday, advising South Florida residents to\nbegin thinking of what last-minute preparations they should make.\n\n\n   ``If it stays on our track, we've got Wednesday and Thursday to\nprepare.'' said National Hurricane Center Director Max Mayfield.\n\n\n   ``We're watching real closely,'' said Palm Beach County\nEmergency Management Director Bill O'Brien, who met with and made\ncalls to the Palm Beach County School Board, American Red Cross and\nstate officials Tuesday.\n\n\n   Partial activation of the emergency operations center could come\ntoday, he said.\n\n\n   The South Florida Water Management District opened low pre-storm\nwater releases from canals in Miami-Dade County Tuesday. Water\nlevels in primary canals in counties farther north, including Palm\nBeach, Martin and St. Lucie were within seasonal ranges so gates\nwere not opened yet.\n\n\n   Lake Okeechobee is below normal level so no releases are\nplanned.\n\n\n   Florida Power &AMP; Light will not position crews until after the\nstorm hits. ``We've found it's better to wait until we really know\nwhere it's going,'' said FPL spokesman Bill Swank. ``All the heavy\nhurricane season preparation has been done and we did a dry run\nearlier.''\n\n\n   By midafternoon Tuesday, local residents were keeping an eye on\nDebby and beginning to make preparations for a possible landfall in\nSouth Florida.\n\n\n   At the Publix supermarket on Southern Boulevard in West Palm\nBeach, workers were stocking extra cases of bottled water that had\nbeen shipped to the store earlier in the day.\n\n\n   ``If you're in the water business right now, that's a good\nbusiness to be in,'' one employee said. ``I'd hate to see what it\nlooks like'' today.\n\n\n   Tyler Franz of West Palm Beach was one of the few people\nstocking up, buying 12 bottles of water.\n\n\n   ``I left work early so I could beat the 5 o'clock rush,'' Franz\nsaid. ``People are going to get home, watch the evening news and\ncome out here. It'll be packed.''\n\n\n   Meanwhile, at the Home Depot on Lake Worth Road, Efrin Valle was\nbuying plywood to cover his carport. He said he and his family are\nwatching the storm, but aren't nervous, yet.\n\n\n   That seems to be the reaction of most people Tuesday, said Jerry\nHester, Home Depot's sales manager.\n\n\n   ``We've been selling panels and plywood, but there's no pan",

      "content": "HURRICANE FORECASTER PREDICTS ACTIVE STORM SEASON FOR '99 \n\n\n\n   ORLANDO, Fla. _ This year's hurricane season in the Atlantic is\nlikely be ``very active'' with a chance of damaging storms striking\nFlorida and the East Coast, a leading hurricane forecaster said\nFriday.\n\n\n   William Gray, an atmospheric scientist and hurricane expert at\nColorado State University, predicted that in the hurricane year\nbeginning June 1 there would be 14 tropical storms, with nine of\nthem hurricanes.\n\n\n   Four of the hurricanes could be major, Category 3 or higher,\nmeaning winds of at least 111 miles per hour on a scale of 1 to 5.\nHurricanes have winds of at least 74 mph, and tropical storm\nwarning are issued when winds reach 55 mph.\n\n\n   Gray discussed his forecast at the annual meeting of the\nNational Hurricane Conference, an organization of hurricane\nexperts.\n\n\n   Based on ``climate signals'' from stratospheric winds and warmer\ncurrents in the north Atlantic, Gray said the ``odds are'' that the\n1999 hurricane season could look like that of last year, when there\nwere 14 storms, 10 of them hurricanes, with three of them\nclassified as major.\n\n\n   Gray said his hurricane-forecast record had been slightly better\nthan a simple projection of climatological records since 1984.\n\n\n   From 1995 to 1998, there were 33 hurricanes, a record for a\nfour-year period. That could signal a return to a cycle of high\nhurricane activity that lasts two or three decades, scientists at\nthe meeting said. The last such cycle was seen in the 1940s and\n1950s.\n\n\n   Gray also announced a new effort to estimate the sites where\nhurricanes would strike. His preliminary calculations show that\nFlorida and the East Coast are 4.5 times more likely to get a major\nstorm this year than in the 1970-1994 period. The odds of a major\nstorm on the Gulf Coast are about the same as during that period,\nhe said.\n\n\n   Christopher Landsea, a research meteorologist at the federal\ngovernment's hurricane research division laboratory in Miami, said\nthe 1970s and 1980s appeared to have been one of the periodic\nlulls.\n\n\n   ``We've been lucky,'' Landsea said. No major storm struck\nFlorida from 1965 to 1992 when Hurricane Andrew caused $33 billion\nin damage. Since the 1960s, millions of people have moved to the\nEastern coastline and built expensive homes, which will make storm\ndamage much more costly, Landsea said.\n\n\n   In Southeast Florida, for example, the population of Dade and\nBroward counties has increased 600 percent between major storms.\n``So it shouldn't come as a huge surprise that we have incredible\ndamages now,'' Landsea said in an interview.\n\n\n   The possibility of more major storms striking the built-up coast\n``scares me to death,'' said James Lee Witt, director of the\nFederal Emergency Management Agency, who has been pushing pilot\nprograms to hurricane-proof homes and remove as many as 500 homes\nfrom flood-prone areas. Hurricane damage in the United States last\nyear totaled $7.3 billion.\n\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n\n   The coastal situation is a ``time bomb,'' said Rade Musulin, a\nvice president of Farm Bureau insurance concern in Florida. Musulin\nsaid that many of the modern coastal houses were particularly\nvulnerable, built with large windows, vaulted ceilings and pools.\n\n\n   As the 1999 hurricane season approaches, experts are taking a\nnumber of initiatives to improve warnings to coastlines. The\nNational Hurricane Center announced that it would issue gale\nwarnings up to six hours earlier, or 24 hours, rather than the\ncurrent 18.\n\n\n   Jerry Jarrell, the director of the center, also urged Florida to\ndo something about ``the Key West problem,'' including the\nconstruction of a four-lane highway all the way from Key West. When\nHurricane Georges, a Category II storm, struck last October, 30,000\npeople elected to stay on the Florida Keys. Computer models show\nthat in a Category IV storm, Key West would be under water, Jarrell\nsaid. ``We would have massive casualties,'' he said.",

But,\nas the storm weakened, some residents relaxed, let their dogs out\nfor a run on the unusually quiet streets, and waited.\n\n\n   In the usually boisterous bars on Duval Street, people who rely\non the tourists for their living said they definitely were not\nbetter off alone.\n\n\n   ``It's dead, for us,'' said Kathy Wolfort, a bartender and\nwaitress in the famous Key West bar, Sloppy Joe's. ``Usually right\nnow, our whole dining room is full.'' Of the 65 tables in the\nrestaurant, only 15 were being used.\n\n\n   Forecasters warned that the good news about Debby might not\nlast, and that the storm could strengthen once it heads back over\nwater, perhaps in the Straits or the Gulf, and said it could\nthreaten the west coast of Florida, or the Panhandle, or elsewhere\nin the Gulf.\n\n\n   The storm skirted Puerto Rico, but brought only minimum damage\nthere and in the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\n\n   In Miami, some residents went to buy plywood and other emergency\nsupplies, but the threat, at least for the city and surrounding\narea, seemed to have evaporated.\n\n\n   ``It doesn't look to us like there is any chance this will\nbecome a hurricane, at least in the short term,'' said Mayfield.\n\n\n   But there was still a chance that the storm would turn slightly\nmore north, and threaten South Florida.\n\n\n   ``We don't want to let our guard down,'' said Mayfield.\n\n\n   If the storm does pass through the Straits and heads into the\nwarm waters of the Gulf, it could pick up strength and threaten the\nGulf Coast, he said.\n\n\n   Hurricane Frederick in 1979 did just that, he said. It was a\nragged storm, too, but became a dangerous hurricane as it swept\nacross the Gulf to the coast of Alabama.\n\n\n   Even if winds do not create much damage, the storm is expected\nto bring torrential rains, wherever it makes landfall.",

(AP) -- Tropical Storm Dennis closed in on  \nthe already battered North Carolina coast on Saturday, threatening \nto strengthen into a hurricane again. Some people were stranded for \na second time on the Outer Banks islands as ferries shut down. \n\n\n\tForecasters said Dennis was likely to be a minimal hurricane by  \nthe time it hit land just northeast of Morehead City late Saturday, \nand hurricane warnings were in effect along much of the North \nCarolina shoreline. Tropical storm warnings extended northward \nalong the Virginia coast to Chincoteague. \n\n\n\tResidents of the fishing villages on the marshy peninsula where  \nthe storm was expected to strike were more frustrated than worried \nas the storm approached. \n\n\n\t``We put our boats in the harbor down here last Saturday and we  \nain't got out yet,'' said Jonathan Robinson, a commercial fisherman \nfrom Stacy. ``We're anticipating more bad weather, but hopefully it \nwon't be as bad as the initial hit. We'll be glad to see Dennis \ngoing.'' \n\n\n\tIn spite of 30-foot swells, a few fishermen did go to sea  \nearlier in the week after Dennis made its first pass along the \ncoast, but most waited for the weather to improve. \n\n\n\t``It's not been fittin' to play golf,'' Robinson said. ``I think  \nmost of 'em are just hangin' in there listening to the weather \nreports and drinking some coffee, or a few beers.'' \n\n\n\tFarther north, in southeastern Virginia, an apparent tornado  \ntouched down in the city of Hampton, damaging several apartment \nbuildings and an assisted living center, and 20 to 30 people \nsuffered minor injuries, police spokesman Jeff Walden said. \n\n\n\tAnother twister hit a barn and snapped utility poles in nearby  \nChesapeake, Va., police said. \n\n\n\tAt 3 p.m. EDT Saturday, the storm was centered about 25 miles  \neast-southeast of Cape Lookout and about 55 miles south-southwest \nof Cape Hatteras, the National Weather Service said. It was moving \ntoward the northwest at about 10 mph. \n\n\n\tThe storm's top sustained wind had strengthened slightly to 70  \nmph, and was expected to reach minimal hurricane strength of 74 mph \nby the time its center reached shore, said Michael Moneypenny of \nthe weather service office in Raleigh. He said Dennis would weaken \nrapidly over land while dropping heavy rainfall. \n\n\n\t``There wouldn't be a whole lot of damage. Most of it would be  \nflooding from the sound side,'' he said. \n\n\n\tCedar Island, a small community about four miles from Stacy, or  \n25 miles northeast of Morehead City, was about three-quarters under \nwater by early afternoon as the wind pushed water into the area, \nMoneypenny said. \n\n\n\tRain spread inland from Maryland to southern North Carolina as  \nthe storm approached. \n\n\n\tTourists on Hatteras Island who ignored evacuation orders last  \nweekend found themselves stranded for a second time Saturday when \nthe rising wind from the approaching storm disrupted ferry service \nto the mainland. \n\n\n\t``We're stuck,'' said Martha Bourne of Beaufort, who got to the  \nHatteras ferry landing in time to learn that service had been shut \ndown as Dennis moved closer to shore. \n\n\n\tA few tourists had left the island Thursday and Friday when the  \nfirst ferries delivered emergency supplies and heavy equipment to \nHatteras and Ocracoke Island. \n\n\n\tEngineers worked Saturday to rebuild N.C. 12, the only highway  \nalong the low-lying, fragile Outer Banks. The highway had been open \nto residents with four-wheel-drive vehicles, but was closed again \nSaturday afternoon as the wind increased and torrential rain \nflooded the island. \n\n\n\tThe storm's first pass tore out a half-mile section of the road  \nnorth of Buxton, and reconstruction work was expected to take \nseveral days.",
