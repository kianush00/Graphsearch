The project has\nbeen a dream long cherished by the Chinese nation almost for a\ncentury.\n\n\nIn the 1910s, Dr. Sun Yat-sen, forerunner of the Chinese\ndemocratic revolution, became the first to propose the\nconstruction of a gigantic water control project around the Three\nGorges in the middle reaches of the Yangtze, China's largest\nriver.\n\n\nA major flood occurred on the Yangtze once every decade during\nthe two millenia from the Han Dynasty (206 BC-AD 220) to the end\nof the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), and two catastrophic floods in the\nthirties of this century alone claimed 300,000 lives along the\nriver.\n\n\nUpon the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949,\nthe first generation of New China's leaders headed by Mao Zedong\nstarted to draw up a blueprint for the project.\n\n\nAfter four decades of investigations, planning and debate,\nthe Three Gorges Project was finally approved by the National\nPeople's Congress -- the Chinese parliament - in 1992.\n\n\nAs the world's top water control scheme, it is projected to\ncost some 25 billion US dollars. The investment is estimated to\naccount for less than one thousandth of the cumulative GDP during\nthe 17 years of construction, thanks to enhanced national strength\nin the wake of China's reform and opening-up policies adopted 18\nyears ago.\n\n\nA series of knotty problems are involved in the project: the\namount of work of the project is the largest in the world, the\ntechnologies to be used in the project are complex and the 1.2\nmillion people to be relocated in the project area are\nunprecedented.\n\n\nConstruction of the project has been focused on a market\nmechanism and international conventional practices. After five\nyears of its initiation, the first stage of the project is\ncompleted ahead of schedule, construction quality has complied\nwith the pre-designed standards, and the actual investment is four\nbillion yuan less than the initial projected budget.\n\n\nMoreover, a development-oriented resettlement program has\nhelped the displaced farmers to become the first to be better-off\nin the Three Gorges area. By now more than 60,000 farmers have\nbeen resettled.\n\n\nThe Three Gorges Fund, a major source for the massive\ninvestment in the project, is based on an appropriate price\nincrease in power charges across the country. From 1993-1997, the\nfund collected a total of 13.7 billion yuan, equivalent to an\naverage of 11 yuan contributed by every Chinese.\n\n\nThe dream of the Three Gorges Project represent the Chinese\npeople's aspiration for building a stronger China.\n\n\nUpon its completion in 12 years, the project will bring huge\nbenefit to the nation by putting an end to floods in the middle\nand lower reaches of the Yangtze, relieving 15 million people of\nthe scourge of flood, and providing an average of additional 70 kw\nof electricity for each Chinese every year.",

President Jiang Zemin made a speech at the\nceremony to mark the success of the river-damming.\n\n\nThe full text of the speech is as follows:\n\n\nComrades and Friends,\n\n\nToday, the world-renowned Three Gorges Water Conservation\nProject (TGP) has successfully completed the damming of the main\ncourse of the Yangtze River. This is a major event in China's\nefforts to achieve modernization and also a remarkable feat in the\nhistory of the mankind to reshape the nature and exploit natural\nresources.\n\n\nThis success will greatly inspire our people of all\nethnic groups who are now engaged in reform, opening-up and\nmodernization drive with full confidence.\n\n\nOn behalf of the Party Central Committee and the State Council,\nI would like to extend our warm congratulations and cordial\ngreetings to the builders, the scientific and technical personnel\nof the project as well as the cadres and masses of people in the\nreservoir area, and express our sincere gratitude to people of all\nethnic groups in the country who have supported the project and to\nour compatriots in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region\n(SAR), Macao and Taiwan, overseas Chinese and international\nfriends who have cared for the project.\n\n\nSeventy years ago, Dr. Sun Yat-Sen, the great forerunner of\nChina's democratic revolution, raised the idea of exploiting the\nwater and hydro-electric resources of the Three Gorges. After the\nfounding of New China, Comrade Mao Zedong, Comrade Deng Xiaoping\nand other proletarian revolutionaries gave a great deal of their\ntime and thought to the proposed Three Gorges Project. Several\ngenerations of Chinese scientists have put in an enormous amount\nof hard intellectual work. The rapid economic development and\nmarkedly increased overall national strength of our country since\nthe initiation of its reform and opening-up have provided adequate\nconditions for the building of this unprecedented cross-century\nproject. The age-old dream of the Chinese people to develop and\nutilize the resources of the Three Gorges of the Yangtze River has\ncome closer to becoming true. This proves vividly once again that\nsocialism is superior in being capable of concentrating resources\nto do big jobs.",

Their latest report states that a majority of\nthe sights will remain unchanged, and although 39 scenic spots\nwill eventually be under water, that represents only 13 percent of\nthe total.\n\n\nHuang Zhenli, an expert on environmental protection, said that\nafter the reservoir fills up in 2009, the water in Xiling Gorge,\nsite of the dam, will rise 100 meters at most, which has very\nlittle impact on the cliff sights there, which are several hundred\nmeters to 1,000 meters high.\n\n\nWhen people view it from the valley of the Xiling Gorge, their\n\"feeling of a gorge\" will only be decreased by one-tenth, he\nnoted. In Wuxia and Qutang, the \"feeling of a gorge\" will decrease\nby not more than one-twentieth or even one-thirtieth, because the\nwater rise will be less when one goes from east to west, Dr. Huang\nsaid.",

China's energy consumption\nafter 1990 registered an annual growth of 4 percent and there is\nan accelerated trend,\" Lu added. The coal-burning-dominant energy\nstructure, however, could worsen such eco-problems.\n\n\nThis world's largest hydro-power station is designed to ease the\nenergy shortage and improve the eco-environment.\n\n\nExperts estimated that in comparison with thermal power plants\nof the same generation capacity, the Three Gorges Project, with an\ninstalled generation capacity of 18.2 megawatts, can save 50\nmillion tons of raw coal and cut 100 million tons of carbon\ndioxide, and reduce large amounts of dust, sewage and\ndiscarded residue.\n\n\nPeople are also concerned with fact that the slower waterflow\nin the future reservoir may weaken the Yangtze's self-cleaning\ncapability in discharging and washing off the toxic contents\npoured by shoreside industries.\n\n\nIn a recent interview with a famous Chinese writer, Gan Yuping,\nvice-mayor of Chongqing Municipality, said that the Three Gorges\nproject will not be turned into a cesspool.",

But now\nthe 85-year-old authority on China's water conservation and\nhydropower is a staunch advocate.\n\n\n\"At that time, China's economic and financial conditions\ncouldn't afford such a gigantic project as the Three Gorges\nproject. But now China is rapidly gaining national strength, with\nequally fast development of science and technology, and the\nnational economy need more power. That's why I say 'Yes' to the\nproject,\" he said.\n\n\nThe Three Gorges project cost 6.5 billion yuan in 1995,\naccounting for 0.11 percent of GDP, a striking contrast to bygone\ndays when the country had to scrape to fund even a minor project.\n\n\nThe two endeavors are not only a symbol of overall national\nstrength, but also direct results of the reform and opening-up\npolicy.\n\n\n\"Without the reform and opening-up drive, projects like these\nwould be inconceivable,\" said Zhang Jiyao, vice-minister of Water\nResources, who is in charge of the Xiaolangdi project.\n\n\nThe first large project to be run according to\ninternationally-accepted practices, Xiaolangdi used more than a\nbillion US dollars in loans, and was open to worldwide\nbidding. Consequently, the construction work of the dam, the flood\ndiversion project, and the power-generation project went to some\nmultinational corporations.\n\n\nOf the more than 10,000 builders on Xiaolangdi, over 700\nexperts and technicians came from some 50 countries and regions,\nprompting some observers to call the construction site a\n\"mini-United Nations\".\n\n\n\"Open the door for the construction of the Three Gorges\nproject\" is the comment on international cooperation by Lu Youmei,\ngeneral manager of the Yangtze Three Gorges Project Development\nCorp, which overally takes care of the project.\n\n\nDiverse forms of funding were used in China and overseas to\nraise money for the 200-plus-billion-yuan project, with key\ngenerators and other equipment imported from abroad.\n\n\nDespite this fruitful year of 1997 for China's water\nconservation, Chinese water control experts remain\nsober-minded. As Prof. Pan put it, \"we cannot expect to finish our\nwork with the two projects once for all. In fact, we still have a\nlong way to go in harnessing the Yangtze and Yellow rivers.\"",
