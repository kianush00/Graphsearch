DEBUG:simuser.user.query_generators.srex_refined_query:raw text: LOW-HEAT OVEN SLOWLY BRINGS OUT THE GOODNESS IN FRUITS  For some years now, I have been using low, dry heat to add intense flavor to tomatoes or to make sweet root-vegetable chips. I simply put the vegetables in a very low oven and let them laze away as the moisture is slowly drawn out and the sugars become caramelized and profoundly sweet.    Recently, to add a little distinction to some of the more common fruits that I use in desserts, condiments, salads or garnishes, I began experimenting with this oven-drying technique to bring out their inherent syrupy goodness. After some fits and starts, I think that I perfected the method.    At the restaurant, we have been turning out ambrosial, lightly dried peaches, plums and nectarines as they hit the height of their ripeness this summer. With fall approaching, we began drying heirloom apples and pears with just as much success.    Drying fruit (or vegetables) at home is just as easy. Any type of oven will do: gas, electric or convection.    If you are in no hurry _ and if you have an oven setting of less than 200 degrees, which is usually marked ``warm'' _ use that setting and let the fruit dry for up to 12 hours. If 200 degrees is your lowest setting, dry the fruit for no longer than 6 hours. The larger the pieces, the moister the fruit (or vegetable) will remain.    Simply place the pieces on baking sheets lined with parchment paper, leaving at least an inch around each one, and put the sheets in a low oven. Take a peek from time to time; the drying is done when the edges begin to curl, the flesh begins to firm up and the center is still very soft. Or just taste the fruit as it dries, and remove it when it reaches the intensity you like.    For this fall salad, the pears are only lightly dried. They retain a great deal of their moisture, and their sugar takes on just a hint of caramel. To add an even greater depth of flavor, I marinate them in port and ginger before sending them off for a long bask.    COMPOSED SALAD OF RED OAK-LEAF LETTUCE, FENNEL, OVEN-DRIED PEARS, TOASTED WALNUTS AND MAYTAG BLUE CHEESE    Time: 2 hours 15 minutes, including 2 hours marinating and drying    6 Comice pears    1 cup port wine    3 tablespoons light brown sugar    1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger    { cup extra virgin olive oil    3 tablespoons fine quality, well-aged balsamic vinegar    Coarse salt and freshly cracked black pepper to taste    2 medium fennel bulbs    2 heads red oak-leaf lettuce, well washed, dried and pulled apart    { cup toasted walnut pieces (if available, black walnuts add an interesting note)    4 ounces Maytag Blue Cheese.    1. Peel pears, cut them in half lengthwise, and carefully remove core and stem.    2. Combine port, brown sugar and ginger in a shallow baking dish. Add pear halves, cut-side down, and spoon port mixture over them. Cover with plastic film and marinate for 1 hour, turning from time to time.    3. Preheat oven to 200 degrees. Place marinated pears on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet in the oven, and dry for about 1 hour or until pears are just beginning to firm but remain moist in the center.    4. Whisk together the olive oil and vinegar. Season to taste with salt and cracked black pepper. Wash and trim the fennel bulbs. Cut bulbs in half lengthwise, then cut fennel lengthwise into very thin slices.    5. Beginning at the wide end, cut each half of pear lengthwise, down to but not through the stem end.    6. Toss lettuce and fennel together. Add a small amount of dressing, and toss to combine. Place equal portions of the dressed mixture on each of six luncheon plates. Fan two pear halves across the greens, overlapping the stem ends. Sprinkle a few walnut pieces around the edges of the plates. Crumble an equal portion of the cheese over each plate. Drizzle a bit of the remaining dressing over the top, and serve.    Yield: 6 servings.

Drugs will be safer, and more tailored to treat specific diseases with fewer side effects, scientists said yesterday at an international meeting of technology experts in Seattle. In addition, patients will be able to tell before they take a drug if it will work for them, given their particular genetic makeup.

DEBUG:simuser.user.query_generators.srex_refined_query:raw text: The vegetables are loaded not just with useful fiber and vitamins (A and C), but they've got phytochemicals, sulforaphane, all compounds that are believed to fight everything from colon and breast cancer to Alzheimer's disease.    So if broccoli, cauliflower and their various cousins in the vegetable patch are life-enhancers, are they even more so when grown organically?    Yes, according to the people at Warren Weber's Star Route Farm in Bolinas. They believe their organic crops are not only healthier but that they taste better than their conventionally grown counterparts.    ``That's what customers tell us,'' says production manager Douglas Gallagher.    The consumer feedback is an advantage of entering the farmers' market business, which the 25-year-old Star Route Farm did this year, making its products more widely available to consumers who increasingly ask for organic produce.    Fifteen years ago, Gallagher says, Star Route's 40 acres _ supplemented by twice that acreage at its satellite farm in the Coachella Valley of Southern California _ would have been considered large for an organic operation. Now, he says, the operation is small fish in an expanding pond, as many large-scale farms jump on the organic bandwagon.    The reasons include greater consumer awareness as well as the development of natural pest-fighting products and fertilizers, which can be applied with conventional machinery. ``You don't have to make your own compost any more,'' Gallagher points out.    Still, Star Route relies heavily on a natural crop cycle to maintain its soil and guarantee healthy and plentiful future crops. As soon as the last broccoli and cauliflower are harvested _ in a few more weeks _ the Bolinas fields will be planted with clover and other cover crops that get plowed under in the spring. Star Route's restaurant and retail customers will then receive essentially the same crops (broccoli, lettuces, herbs, flowers and root vegetables) from the Coachella Valley farm, which, in turn, converts to cover crops for the hot summer months.    Gallagher says Star Route's location on a flood plain is ideal for cool-weather lovers like broccoli. The heavy soil (technically, blucher loam) isn't well suited for root vegetables, but the crucifers thrive here from spring to fall _ even into mid-winter if it's a dry year.    Competition from large farms that have switched to organic practices _ some as far away as Arizona and Mexico _ may benefit consumers by driving prices down, but it's obviously a concern for small operations.    Weber and Gallagher are part of a group of west Marin growers who are working with the county's Agricultural Commissioner's Office to create a Marin organic label to promote the use of locally grown produce.    Support from trend-setting restaurateurs who want their produce not only fresh and natural but locally grown if at all feasible, is a boon to farms like Star Route. Plus, it helps to be virtually in the backyard of a metropolis.    ``We can drive to Ferry Plaza (site of a Saturday farmers' market) in an hour,'' says Gallagher, so the distance, and time, from field to table are about as short as they can get.

DEBUG:simuser.user.query_generators.srex_refined_query:raw text: &HT;       I am sitting in a restaurant in the North Carolina mountains, looking at the menu. One of the offerings is something called marinated and grilled pork tenderloin with rosemary-Zinfandel sauce, goat cheese-chive mash and Carolyn's fresh-picked snap beans, whomever Carolyn the bean-picker might be.    As I am not big on goat cheese-chive mash, my choice, instead, is the marinated and grilled leg of lamb with mint aioli, vegetable marmalade and Tuscan beans. Although I had no idea what ``aioli'' was, it just sounded better than the goat cheese-chive mash.    Passed up, also, was the too adventurous-sounding chocolate-infused espresso-crusted grilled tenderloin of beef with Irish cream sauce, French beans and goat cheese-au gratin potatoes. I thought to myself that if I wanted coffee with dinner, I'd order it in a cup instead of ``infused'' in a piece of beef.    When my plate arrives, I look down at it, then across to my wife with my best ``is-that-all-there-is?'' look. She has problems of her own. Her citrus-soy marinated rare grilled yellowfin tuna with jasmine rice, stir-fried vegetables and a variety of sauces more common to Japanese restaurants seems to still be flapping. This is one big piece of sushi.    She sends it back so that the cook may kill and warm it.    What I'm looking at on my plate are circular-placed, quarter-sized, thin pieces of lamb; six in all. I could get all six pieces into one mouthful. Between them are curious-looking dollops of a light green substance that is identified to me as the aioli and further defined as mayonnaise flavored with crushed garlic; infused, I am certain.    The rest of the entree has this hockey puck-looking disk of beans glued together by the vegetable marmalade.    It is then that my wife and I fondly begin discussing the dinner we had a couple of nights earlier in South Carolina _ a tangy, filling platter of Memphis-style ribs, baked potato and salad. Note that each and all of these ingredients are identifiable to the average American.    It would seem that in these recent decades of chi-chi American gastronomy, presumably foisted upon us by California chefs run amok, there are becoming just two types of restaurant dining: fast food and no food. What's in-between is fading from the restaurant platter.    Try going to one of those restaurants where the kitchen is out in the open, the chefs considered to be celebrities, and try to get some meatloaf. Fat chance!    I left the restaurant for my room, still hungry and longing for that jar of peanuts on my nightstand and a cold Dr Pepper.    The experience of enigmatic and paltry main courses reminded me of a column written by a now-gone colleague who tired of the trend to fantasy-style dining. He showed up at a 7-Eleven one night, and foraged the food cabinets of the establishment. ``First, I munched on an adventurous pemmican appetizer called a Super Jerk Slim Jim,'' John Keasler wrote. ``It sent my taste buds right into happy little aerobics!    ``The main course,'' he continued, ``is prepared by a system of micro (or little-ditty) waves. My companion was overjoyed with her Red Hot Beef and Bean Burro, an astounding bargain at 79 cents, while I literally drooled over my Shredded Beef Chimichanga With Green Chili and Cheese in a Fried Flour Tortilla, at the same price.''    So, that seems to be our choice: aioli, chocolate-infused espresso-crusted something, goat cheese-chive mash on one side and ribs, hamburgers and a plain old steak or fried catfish on the other.    No one ever had to explain a menu to me at Denny's, or even Shoney's.    But that's what's so great about this country, eh?; the choice.

About 300 members of anti-VFA groups trooped to the Senate building on Thursday to express their indignation over the VFA. They also pressed for the release of 22 people who were arrested and detained for disrupting Senate proceedings the other day, the newspaper said. Armed with rocks, wooden clubs and rotten vegetables, the protesters tried to fight their way into the Senate's session hall where lawmakers were debating the new military pact, the newspaper said. But their attempt to storm the Senate building was repulsed by the Senate's security force, it said. Protesters lighted firecrackers and threw spoiled vegetables to the marines, the newspaper said. A soldier suffered deep cuts in the arm after a protester hit him with a wooden pole, while a policeman suffered contusions, it said.

Oh, it's filling enough, but it won't put you on the superhighway to good nutrition. What you need is a hand-held PC (power combo), a sandwich that will output more vitamins and proteins than fats and carbohydrates.    Oh sure, a sandwich made with pork or chicken or most any other protein is going to contain some fat. But you can downgrade fat content while augmenting flavor using these processes:    _ Buy the leanest cuts of meat you can find. Lean pork chops, chicken and turkey breast, and lean roast beef slices are all good choices.    _ Trim visible fat from the meat.    _ Add flavor and tenderize meat simultaneously by marinating in citrus juices.    _ Use seafood such as fish fillets or crab meat as sandwich fillers.    _ Cook without added fat. Grilling, steaming, poaching and blackening are all good methods to use. Skip frying and sauteeing.    _ Pile on the vegetables. Tomatoes, bell peppers and onions have exuberant flavors, but don't forget less obvious vegetables such as portobellos, jicama, cucumber, carrot and radishes. These add texture and interest to your sandwich. For a more subtle flavor, grill vegetables before adding them to the sandwich.    _ Reserve the sandwich bread for peanut butter and jelly. Instead, try some of the many specialty breads in supermarkets these days, including Tuscan, seven-grain, pita bread and Portuguese rolls.    The variety of ingredients make creating a hand-held PC as easy as dialing the phone, but the combinations are as endless as sites on the Web. Here are a few suggestions to get you surfing for a new sandwich:    _ Blacken one chicken breast per person. Slice chicken breast and toss with julienned red bell peppers and onions. Line a pita bread with lettuce and stuff with chicken mixture.    _ Poach a 4-ounce tuna steak for each sandwich. Cut into cubes. Toss tuna with diced cucumber, diced red onion, grated carrot, sliced black olives and feta cheese. Mash 1 clove garlic to a paste. Whisk with 2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar, 1 1/2 tablespoons lemon juice and 3/4 teaspoon Dijon mustard. Drizzle in 1/3 cup olive oil while whisking. toss with tuna and vegetables. Stuff mixture into a pita.    &UR;  &QL;    CUBAN PORK SANDWICH    (Makes 4 servings)    4 center-cut, boneless pork chops    1 cup lime juice plus more for avocado    1 teaspoon cumin    1 large tomato    1 Haas avocado    4 Portuguese rolls    Hot sauce    Trim all visible fat from sides of pork chops. Butterfly each pork chop by laying on a cutting board. Cut from one side, almost to the other, as close to the center as possible. Pound the chops lightly with a meat mallet to make the chops as even in thickness as possible.    Combine lime juice and cumin in a resealable plastic bag. Add chops and marinate, refrigerated, 2 hours. Slice tomato. Peel and slice avocado. Coat avocado slices with lime juice to prevent them from browning.    Light coals or gas grill and bring to medium-high heat. Toast rolls on grill. Remove pork from marinade and grill until cooked through, about 2 minutes per side.

This marine vegetable is an anomaly of nature, not industry _ though it would not be showing up in stores now without a little help from human hands.    Sea parsley, a tiny, curly leafed, burgundy-colored seaweed, is a miniature version of dulse, the red marine plant best known to diners as an ingredient in seaweed salads in Japanese restaurants. It is a natural mutation, discovered in 1978 by a group of scientists off Grand Manan Island in the Bay of Fundy, near the coast of Maine.    The scientists formed a company, Ocean Produce International, to cultivate the seaweed in saltwater tanks and sell it.    Until a few months ago, this delicacy was known only to Japanese and other Asian cooks, as well as vegetarians, who bought it directly from the company. But now it is being sold, in one-ounce packages, for about $5 at specialty groceries in New York. It is also available by mail order from Adriana's Caravan, (800) 316-0820.    It did not take long for chefs to be captivated by this new ingredient, which smells like the ocean but whose taste changes, depending on how it is used.    Rick Moonen, the executive chef of Oceana, said that sea parsley ``seems to have a natural affinity to Asian ingredients, but also classic French preparations, like consomme.'' He adds it to seafood soups or stews or to the pot when steaming a fish. The seaweed lends a briny yet clean flavor.    As a Canadian product, sea parsley often turns up on the menu at the Canadian Consulate in New York, where Louis Charest, the executive chef, has been using it for a year or so. He chops it and adds it to salads, as he would arugula. He also uses it to flavor salmon, sturgeon and turbot dishes; buries a fish in it for steaming, and includes it in a warm lobster salad.    Sea parsley, like most seaweed, is packed with vitamins and calcium, and contains amino acids, which break down food fibers and permeate them, changing their texture. If sea parsley is used raw or barely cooked, the changes are subtle. If simmered or broiled with other ingredients, however, it tenderizes them and alters their taste.    What chefs have discovered about this chameleon of a vegetable is that when it is fresh and raw, it has a mild nutty taste with hints of oyster and lots of crunch. When fried, it becomes a golden green color and very crisp, and tastes more like bacon.    Boiled sea parsley becomes deep green and takes on a mussel-like taste. Sun dried, it has a roasted vegetable flavor. Fresh out of a microwave oven, it tastes more like nori and is great when mixed with a little rice vinegar.    So go ahead and do what the chefs do _ experiment. Fry some sea parsley and sprinkle it like croutons on a salad, particularly a salad accompanying cold or smoked seafood, or use it as a garnish for seafood or vegetable dishes or as an accompaniment to smoked fish, sushi and sashimi.    For a wonderful blast of the ocean, add it to broths for poaching or steaming. When boiled in lightly salted water for 15 minutes, sea parsley produces a broth that tastes like clam and oyster juices _ a good base for a chowder or a quick seafood stew.    Visually, it may take some imagination to recognize the similarities between surf parsley and the more familiar turf parsley. But just as curly or flat leaf parsley gives a dish a whiff of the garden, its marine counterpart bespeaks the mysterious flavors of the deep.

Wamukomwe Sud, one of the 13 floating islands in the lake in central Uganda, has been divided into two parts and started sinking on January 16 night when a heavy downpour hit the lake. Kasisaki Nsibirwa, the former local council vice-councillor of Kalungi sub-county, Nakasongola District, told the paper that part of it was breaking away and removed from its usual place and got submerged. Some residents and vendors visiting the Sud to collect fish started to desert the floating island by canoes. Some of the victims are still missing for the time being. Hundreds escaped to the three other nearby Suds and the neighbor mainland districts, the report added. Suds are floating islands in the waters of Nile River system consisting of rotten branches and soil and covered with vegetation. An interesting fact is that there were no cholera cases in these Suds when half of the districts of the country was hit by the epidemic.

(Back in the mists of vegetable time, carrots were purple or white; they were bred to today's hue by the Dutch.)    So excited were the Aggies by their beloved maroon in vegetable form, the publicity created demand that exceeded supply when the carrots were introduced two years ago. Now there are two operations in Texas' Rio Grande Valley licensed to grow the carrots, and another grower is operating in Australia.    Now that the carrots are widely available in grocery stores, it's time to get acquainted with their eating qualities. They're quite sweet, these purple guys, and good for eating out of hand. They're also nice marinated and grilled or roasted. Don't saute them, because they turn an unpleasant brown. As for those Longhorns who might hesitate to support their rivals, they should keep in mind that these carrots are far higher than ordinary carrots in alpha and beta carotene, important preventatives for cancer, heart disease and eye degeneration.    _    PICKLED MAROON CARROTS    Yields 1 quart    _ 1 cup water    _ 1/2 cup rice wine vinegar    _ 1/3 cup sugar    _ 2 tablespoons kosher salt    _ 1 clove garlic    _ 1 teaspoon mustard seed    _ 1 teaspoon whole black peppercorns    _ 1 teaspoon ginger, minced    _ 1 1/2 habanero chiles, seeded and chopped    _ 1 bunch (4 large) maroon carrots    Combine all ingredients except chiles and carrots in saucepan.

The statement from Foreign Ministry of Tanzania said the Great Lakes Sanctions Committee which met here on May 6, has released a list of 25 categories of goods to be exported to Burundi, including food stuffs, medicines, construction, educational and agricultural items. The statement said, The idea is to ease the difficulties on the elderly people, women and children, so the goods which are supposed to consolidate the military regime in Burundi are still not allowed, emphasizing that the sanctions against Burundi are still intact. The food stuffs allowed include animals and their products, fish and marine products, fruits, nuts, vegetables and edible roots and tubers. On the list there are also cereals like maize, wheat, rice, millet and animal or vegetable fats and oils and related goods. Others are agricultural items like hoes, fertilizers, chemicals and pesticide. Apart from the above-mentioned, the list also includes minerals, construction materials along with laboratory equipment, medicines and pharmaceutical products. However, sources from the ministry said there is no bilateral trade between Burundi and any other country in the zone and those goods may be traded by individuals.

Two days is a long time to marinate anything, particularly fish, but it takes that long for the marinade to work its magic. It is a blend of orange juice and zest, brown sugar, sake, a light miso paste and the pungent chili paste called sambal oelek.    Chilean sea bass, which is actually Patagonian tooth fish, starts out as what I call a Jell-O fish: its flesh is soft, wet and oily. Steam it and its texture will remind you of soft-boiled eggs. But cover it with the marinade and all that changes, strikingly.    The marinade's salts and sugars act as a cure and turn the soft fish into one that flakes in large, firm shards. Marinated, the Chilean sea bass comes to resemble cod, but creamier and richer.    And after two days, it is not just the texture that changes. The fish is imbued with the salty, sweet, bitter, acidic flavors, complexity and exotic richness of the marinade's ingredients, many of them rooted in the traditional cooking of Japan, and all of them intensified when the fish is cooked.    I top the glazed fillets with cilantro leaves and surround them with a salad of mango and scallion greens splashed with a citrusy dressing, an integral part of the dish.    The fish calls for the coolness and sharpness of the salad and its dressing, whose flavors are haunting but immediately appealing. The crisp citrus taste in the dressing comes from the citrus-flavored soy sauce called ajipon, and from yuzu kosho, a chili paste that includes yuzu, a Japanese citrus fruit prized for the oils in its skin. To pull the flavors into balance, I add mirin, a sweet Japanese rice wine, and rice wine vinegar.    You may have to make a few shopping trips to collect the ingredients for this dish, but I promise you they will be worth it. &QL;   &QL;    MISO-GLAZED CHILEAN SEA BASS &QL;    Time: 40 minutes, plus 2 days for marinating the fillets &QL;   &QL;    2 oranges    1 cup freshly squeezed orange juice    { cup light-brown sugar    } cup sake    1\ cups light miso paste (see note)    1 tablespoon sambal oelek chili paste (see note)    6 skinless fillets of Chilean sea bass, each about 7 ounces    \ cup ajipon (see note)    \ cup mirin (see note)    \ cup seasoned rice vinegar    \ cup soybean oil    1 teaspoon yuzu kosho (see note)    1 tablespoon vegetable oil    2 carrots, peeled and finely shredded    { daikon, peeled and finely shredded    2 teaspoons soy sauce    1 ripe mango, peeled, pitted and cut into short, thin strips    3 scallions, green parts only, thinly sliced diagonally    6 sprigs cilantro, leaves only. &QL;   &QL;    1.

Place fish and marinade in a large zipper-lock plastic bag, making sure fish is coated with marinade. Press out the air, and seal securely. Refrigerate for 2 days.    3.

They suit today's lifestyles because they're usually easy to make and don't require cooking expertise. They're perfect for little meals or finger-food snacks with drinks. Tapas (pronounced TOP-ahs), translated ``lids on top,'' are appetizers _ the Spanish equivalent of French hors d'oeuvres and Mexican bocas (short for ``bocados,'' meaning mouthfuls or bites).    It's the second time around for tapas. Although some Houston restaurants have offered tapas for about 20 years, they enjoyed a brief fad in the '80s, then faded.    Tapas went the way of fondue and crepes until the '90s, when restaurants introduced Houstonians to South American-style tidbits.    Restaurants concerned with authenticity have an education job on their hands. Some classic Spanish ingredients are an acquired taste, particularly smelt, salt cod, baby eel (angula), squid (calamare), snails, octopus, baby anchovies (boquerones), chorizo sausage, blood sausage (morcilla) and salty-cured Serrano ham.    Shrimp, mussels, a variety of olives, bowls of almonds, fresh pimentos and Spanish Tortilla (potato omelet) receive more instant acceptance.    Penelope Casas has written several books on Spain. In her books, she offers a wealth of tips on tapas, including the following:    Choose a variety of tapas _ vegetables, meats, seafood. Prepare one or several from each category: fried, baked or grilled; cold or marinated; in sauces; or with bread or pastries.    For a large group, choose finger foods or serve tapas on toothpicks. Make 10 to 20 different tapa varieties and set them out buffet-style.    Tapas that need last-minute preparation and should be eaten immediately, should be spaced over the course of the evening and passed on trays.    For a small gathering, start with lighter tapas, such as rice-filled pimentos or seafood-stuffed mushrooms, and progress to more filling tapas.    Serve tapas with sherry (well-chilled fino sherry is traditional), especially if tapas are spicy or salty. Serve with the appropriate white or red wine, beer or sangria.    Among popular tapas with drinks are croquettes (made with potatoes or seafood), grilled vegetables with garlic sauce, Potatoes Bravas (spicy potatoes), cheese (Mi Luna offers a platter with goat cheese, Brie and manchego tossed in olive oil that has been infused with peppercorns, chervil and lemon), marinated olives and mushrooms. &QL;   &QL;  XXXXXEND OF STORY &QL;

DEBUG:simuser.user.query_generators.srex_refined_query:raw text: THE APPETITE WAITS FOR NO BIRD     Probably the most challenging part of cooking Thanksgiving dinner is deciding what to serve until the turkey is carved. You need some kind of diversionary starter for everyone to nibble at while the lumps are being mashed out of the potatoes and whisked out of the gravy, but it can't be anything really rich or heavy or filling, or no one will ever make it to the pumpkin pie.    And it certainly can't be anything that takes more than a few ingredients and a couple of steps to assemble on a day when even the best cook feels overwhelmed.    You could just go out and buy a few sneaky convenience foods, but the flavors would seem off before a meal that celebrates real home cooking. A better way to give the appearance of being a generous and caring cook without becoming a galley slave is to choose from some quick, simple and surprisingly different starters based on ideas borrowed from classic hors d'oeuvres.    Only one of these takes more than 15 minutes of work, most of them far less. They are all familiar enough to serve to unadventurous relatives on this all-American holiday, but each one has a little twist.    Perhaps my favorite is real onion dip, ideally served with potato chips but almost as good with calorie-deficient raw vegetables. Ever since Lipton took over the supermarket aisle, onion dip has been routinely made with powdered onion soup mix. Even in cookbooks you find recipes like, ``Stir 3 tablespoons onion soup mix into 1 cup sour cream.'' There had to be a way to make it simple without opening up a packet full of mystery ingredients.    It seemed to me that the original idea was to imitate the dominant flavor of onion soup _ caramelized onions _ so I tried doing exactly that. I minced some onions, cooked them in oil until they were well browned and then stirred them into sour cream.    It was a fresh, three-ingredient dip (if you count the oil, which you drain), with clarity, intensity and complexity of flavor. (You can make and serve this right away, but the onion taste intensifies if you allow it to sit, refrigerated, for about a day.)    Similarly, I decided I could improve on the standard recipe for shrimp cocktail sauce, which I always found thin and uninspired. Without departing too far from the original, made with Heinz chili sauce, I came up with a richer, tastier cocktail sauce by borrowing an idea from the famed French chef Joel Robuchon, who adds a little butter.    That not only makes the sauce cling to the shrimp better, but makes it taste equally good warm or cold. (I like it warm, just as a contrast to the cold shrimp.)    Three other Thanksgiving tidbits I developed are even easier, starting with marinated olives. All you have to do is toss a variety of olives in olive oil, garlic and herbs; let them stand an hour; then stand back while guests ask incredulously, ``What did you do with these?''    The addition of a fragrant, tangy lemon cut into segments makes them even more special. But the real key is to use an assortment of good olives, preferably the kind produced in France, Italy, Greece or Spain and sold in bulk.    If possible, include some oil-cured olives, which really come to life when marinated. You can marinate the olives up to a week in advance if you like.    The unusually warm fall this year inspired another super-simple appetizer. Fresh figs are still in produce markets _ and still ripening in California _ and they can be halved and stuffed with any creamy, flavorful cheese. Usually I rely on a good blue, but creamy goat cheese, drizzled with balsamic vinegar, is more crowd-pleasing.    Finally, I wanted a simple, light dipping sauce for raw vegetables, so I warmed olive oil with garlic, freshened the mix with uncooked olive oil, seasoned it with lots of salt and pepper and spiked it with lemon rind. The flavors go great with fennel, one of the easiest of vegetables to convert into crudites.    Just trim the bulb by cutting off the bottom half-inch or so, then stand it up on its flat end and slice downward to ma

The crested ibis population has grown from merely seven in 1981, when it was first found in Yangxian County, northwest China's Shaanxi Province, to some 200 as a result of the development of breeding technology and environmental protection measures. To give the birds better protection, China invested three million yuan to set up an ibis breeding center in Yangxian County in 1981. El Nino Expected Later This Year or Early Next Year: Experts Chinese oceanographers expect climatic repercussions on global weather as El Nino is expected to come sometime this year or the next. Wang Fei, director of the Marine Environmental Protection Department of the State Oceanic Administration, issued the warning Thursday at a press conference on this year's marine disaster forecast. The conclusion was made by Song Jiaxi and his colleagues with the National Marine Environmental Forecasting Center in their annual marine disaster forecast report, which was released today. More Disastrous Surges Expected This Year in Chinese Waters: Report Chinese oceanographers said more disastrous storm tides and ocean surges are expected this year off the Chinese coast. Wang Fei, director of the Marine Environmental Protection Department of the State Oceanic Administration, said three to five devastating ocean surges are expected during June and October this year, compared to two last year. Wang said Thursday that some coastal areas in south China's Guangdong Province and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region are expecting to have three ocean surges while the provinces of Fujian and Zhejiang and Shanghai City in east China are likely to have one or two. Tibet Encourages Foreign Cooperation in Protecting Environment The Tibet Autonomous Region will expand cooperation with foreign countries and international organizations to improve its ecological environment. A local official said that Tibet has introduced over 20 species of fine pasture strains from abroad over the past decades to update its grassland vegetation and this has played an important role in preventing desertification. Tibet's afforestation drive and effort to control geological disasters will continue in cooperation with other countries and international organizations, the official said.

Answer: A hamburger.    That's the problem with most food poisoning _ the bacteria that cause the misery of stomach cramps, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting cannot be tasted, seen, or smelled, according to an article in the July issue of Redbook magazine.    And what may cause you a few days of feeling yucky can be a serious, even life-threatening, illness for your child.    ``Infants and small children are particularly vulnerable to the toxic effects of food-borne illness,'' says Michael Reed, M.D., director of the Poison Control Center at Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital in Cleveland.    The younger the child, the greater the risk of dehydration from vomiting and diarrhea, which can put the body into shock. Since 50 to 70 percent of outbreaks arise from mishandling of food in the home, there's plenty you can do to keep your family safe.    Here are the summer troublemakers you're most likely to overlook:    1. Shopping trip-ups:    The average food item in your local supermarket has traveled nearly 1,000 miles to get there, notes Robert Hollingworth, Ph.D., director of the National Food Safety and Toxicology Center at Michigan State University. And while the Food and Drug Administration and other food safety experts estimate that perishable foods items such as dairy products, meat, poultry, fish, and vegetables can stay out of the cold for a total of four hours, ``It's probably way too long,'' says Winkler Weinberg, M.D., a member of the Georgia-Pacific Health Smart Institute Advisory Board in Atlanta.    Assume any such food's time in the safety zone is nearly expired and keep it out no longer than an hour, less if it's very hot _ 85 degrees or above.    2. Hot cars    The trunk is your car's hottest spot, and heat incubates bacteria and other food-borne menaces. Stash groceries in the back seat and turn on the air- conditioning, says registered dietitian Molly Gee of the Methodist Health Care System in Houston. And make grocery shopping the last stop on your list of errands.    3. Cold storage    If your refrigerator and freezer are stuffed full, air can't circulate properly, which can create warm, germ-friendly spots.    ``If your refrigerator is only 10 degrees above what it should be, bacteria will grow,'' says Hollingworth. Keep shelves as clear as possible and check your appliances' temperature: Refrigerators should register 34 to 40 degrees and freezers should be at or below 0. (If your appliance doesn't have a built-in thermostat, buy one.)    4. Problematic produce    Raw fruits and vegetables are increasingly the culprits in food-borne illness. Although much of our produce is now imported from countries with less-than-rigorous food safety policies, you can't be less vigilant with homegrown produce.    ``There have been problems with local organic and small-farm fruits and vegetables,'' says Hollingworth. Unless it needs to ripen at room temperature, produce should be refrigerated immediately. Don't bother to wash before storing _ it could get contaminated in the fridge, and you'll need to wash it again, notes Weinberg.    Rinse before eating, then wipe dry with paper towels. Laboratory tests show that rinsing plus wiping removes 99 percent of contaminating germs while water alone removes only 75 percent.    It's a good idea to wash and wipe even thick-rind fruits like melon _ any microorganisms on the outside will be transported inside as you slice.    5. Germy hands    Running the tips of your fingers under cold water does not count as hand-washing, says Weinberg. ``Not only are your hands still contaminated, but so is the dish towel you wiped them on.''    Make sure all family members wash their hands for two minutes (with warm, soapy water) after using the bathroom and before eating.    6.

Answer: A hamburger.    That's the problem with most food poisoning _ the bacteria that cause the misery of stomach cramps, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting cannot be tasted, seen, or smelled, according to an article in the July issue of Redbook magazine.    And what may cause you a few days of feeling yucky can be a serious, even life-threatening, illness for your child, according to Redbook.    ``Infants and small children are particularly vulnerable to the toxic effects of food-borne illness,'' says Michael Reed, M.D., director of the Poison Control Center at Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital in Cleveland.    The younger the child, the greater the risk of dehydration from vomiting and diarrhea, which can put the body into shock. Since 50 to 70 percent of outbreaks arise from mishandling of food in the home, there's plenty you can do to keep your family safe.    Here are the summer troublemakers you're most likely to overlook:    1. Shopping trip-ups:    The average food item in your local supermarket has traveled nearly 1,000 miles to get there, notes Robert Hollingworth, Ph.D., director of the National Food Safety and Toxicology Center at Michigan State University. And while the Food and Drug Administration and other food safety experts estimate that perishable foods items such as dairy products, meat, poultry, fish, and vegetables can stay out of the cold for a total of four hours, ``It's probably way too long,'' says Winkler Weinberg, M.D., a member of the Georgia-Pacific Health Smart Institute Advisory Board in Atlanta.    Assume any such food's time in the safety zone is nearly expired and keep it out no longer than an hour, less if it's very hot _ 85 degrees or above.    2. Hot cars    The trunk is your car's hottest spot, and heat incubates bacteria and other food-borne menaces. Stash groceries in the back seat and turn on the air- conditioning, says registered dietitian Molly Gee of the Methodist Health Care System in Houston. And make grocery shopping the last stop on your list of errands.    3. Cold storage    If your refrigerator and freezer are stuffed full, air can't circulate properly, which can create warm, germ-friendly spots.    ``If your refrigerator is only 10 degrees above what it should be, bacteria will grow,'' says Hollingworth. Keep shelves as clear as possible and check your appliances' temperature: Refrigerators should register 34 to 40 degrees and freezers should be at or below 0. (If your appliance doesn't have a built-in thermostat, buy one.)    4. Problematic produce    Raw fruits and vegetables are increasingly the culprits in food-borne illness.

DEBUG:simuser.user.query_generators.srex_refined_query:raw text: VEGGIE OUT WITH CURTIS    With unrestrained enthusiasm and a smile wider than the Chattahoochee River, Curtis Aikens makes his success look like child's play.    The burly, vegetarian star of the cable TV Food Network's ``Pick of the Day'' has an irresistible sweetness that could make even the most dedicated meat-and-potatoes eater want to gobble a plate of grilled tofu.    All that positive energy is exactly what Aikens used to mask a dark secret for more than 20 years.    ``I'm the first African-American to have a cooking show on TV, yet I didn't learn to read until I was 26,'' Aikens, 40, said during a brief break in a whirlwind Fort Worth weekend.    ``Sharing with kids is what's so important that you achieve things by reaching for them,'' Aikens said. ``I tell the kids to set goals, to strive to be better and to give back.''    Wherever he goes to do personal appearances, either cooking for a charity event or publicizing his latest cookbook, Aikens finds an outlet for spreading his literacy gospel and talking to children about overcoming odds.    Aikens was born in Conyers, Ga., just east of Atlanta. He said he didn't suffer from dyslexia but just wasn't taught properly. He repeated the third grade and just ``schmoozed'' his way through the rest of school.    ``It was exhausting,'' he said. ``I wish someone had been as open to me about asking for help as I try to be when I'm talking to kids.''    He practices what he preaches about giving back: All royalties from his cookbooks _ the latest of three is 1995's ``Curtis Cooks With Heart and Soul'' (William Morris, $23) _ go to reading and literacy programs, he said.    Aikens was 26 and running his own produce business in the San Francisco area when he saw a TV commercial for a literacy program. It promised confidentiality, and Aikens got the tutoring he desperately needed.    Drawing on the passion that his mother, Laura, has for cooking, Aikens turned his love of vegetables and food preparation into a high-profile career. He made his mother's pumpkin pie first when he launched his TV cooking show in Atlanta in 1989.    ``Mama taught me to cook; she's my big inspiration. There's nothing like her collard greens and corn bread,'' he said. ``She's proud of me, and I'm proud of her, too.''    Soon he was the produce man on ABC-TV's ``Home Show,'' and his first cookbook was published in 1990.    His vegetarian theme has had staying power. Originally, he sought a meat-free diet to lose weight but wound up sticking with it because ``vegetables eat and taste good.''    ``I'm not anti-meat. I just grew up loving and eating vegetables,'' he said. ``Our family always believed that vegetables are as big a part of the meal as meat.''    What's his favorite vegetable? Whatever's fresh. Aikens enjoys sauteing veggies in a tiny bit of olive oil and adding a bit of a favorite salad dressing or some marinara for serving. Or he'll grill asparagus, potatoes and any other vegetables that are handy.    ``Most people have no idea how easy this is,'' he said. ``You saute the vegetables a few minutes, cook some pasta and in 10 minutes, it's on the table.''    When he's feeling nostalgic, his favorite dish to make is collard greens, cooked with an onion, sliced bell pepper, garlic, a bit of olive oil and salt. He's happy to report, too, that he can now find decent collard greens in California.    ``Okra is one of my real favorites, but the Southern kind is hard to get in California. The okra we get there from Chile just isn't the same,'' he said.    That's important because Aikens splits his time _ when he's not taping the TV show in New York _ between homes in Georgia and in Marin County, where his two young sons live, north of San Francisco.    Travels will soon take Aikens on his first trip to Great Britain. That's where he'll be working on a new international literacy program with suspense novelist Ken Follett, whom he met recently through mutual friend Robin Leach while vacationing in Antigua.

The four areas are Hakaluki Haor, Teknaf Peninsula Beach, St. Martin's Island and Sonadia Island. The project, to be funded by the Global Environment Facility, will have a significant positive impact on the long-term viability of the country's important bio-diversity resources, Environment and Forest Secretary Syed Marghub Murshed was quoted as saying. The bio-diversity conservation is very critical, he said, adding that the country has already declared six areas to be under threats. In recent years, Bangladesh has shown increased determination to ensure sustainable use and conservation of its natural resources including its bio-diversity, he said. The Department of Environment has initiated the crucial steps of selecting the first six areas, all within the country's highly significant coastal, marine and freshwater wetland eco-systems, he said. Bangladesh is also considering setting up a marine park and Bay park across the coast to preserve the fragile eco-systems, he added. The major threats to the ECAs include excessive cutting of mangrove, sand dune vegetation for fuel, poaching for turtles and turtle eggs, removal of corals for sale, destructive fishing and hunting of shore-birds, experts say.

DEBUG:simuser.user.query_generators.srex_refined_query:raw text: IMPROVISING A SALAD FROM THE GARDEN  When I was the chef at Greens, the vegetarian restaurant in San Francisco, we were affiliated with Green Gulch Farm, which was just across the Golden Gate Bridge, in Marin County. I lived at the farm and worked closely with the head gardener, and together we found and grew unusual seeds. As a result, we were able to serve all kinds of exotic vegetables at the restaurant. Although today it's expected that a restaurant of any stature will be working with farmers or even have its own farm, in 1979 this was not the case.    After driving the crates of produce across the bridge to the restaurant, more often than not I found that I had nothing in enough quantity to feature by itself. So one of my menu standards was what we called Farm Salad _ a composed salad of raw, steamed, pickled and grilled vegetables, with a few sauces, usually accompanied by a wedge of frittata or some hard-cooked eggs, also from the farm. By necessity, these salads were ever-changing, but all presented a variety of tastes and textures.    Now, I choose vegetables from the farmers' market and my small garden, and I've vastly simplified the number of ingredients and the method, using just one dressing for everything. I steam or parboil most of the vegetables, but there is certainly room for raw vegetables, grilled peppers or onions, and pickled vegetables or olives. This dish allows you to improvise based on what's around and how much you want to do.    These days, I like a pestolike dressing based on fresh, fragrant marjoram. Like basil, marjoram is widely used in Liguria, the region around the Italian Riviera. Marjoram has a wonderful, powerful flavor, and it's tied together here with other typical ingredients, like capers, pine nuts and olives, in a sauce akin to one used in the Ligurian salad called cappon magro, which is usually composed of a variety of fish and vegetables. (If you want to add cold steamed or grilled fish to the farm salad, it's perfectly appropriate.) I find it difficult to avoid eating this delicious sauce with a spoon or spreading it on bread.    Although the sauce recipe below is fairly precise, the vegetable suggestions are just that: suggestions. If you figure at least 12 ounces of vegetables a person, along with a little protein _ in the form of hard-boiled egg, fish or a combination _ the meal will work out fine.    FARM SALAD WITH MARJORAM SAUCE    Time: about 1 hour    4 medium beets, or more small ones    12 small new potatoes    1 pound green beans, trimmed    4 to 8 small carrots, peeled    2 red onions, peeled and cut into half-inch rounds    2 small zucchini, cut in half lengthwise    { cup plus 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil    1 {-inch-thick slice good white bread, crusts trimmed    2 tablespoons red wine vinegar    1 teaspoon minced garlic    2 tablespoons marjoram leaves    3 tablespoons drained capers    { cup pine nuts    1 cup finely minced parsley leaves    2 tablespoons pitted olives, like nicoise    Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste    12 radishes, trimmed    4 to 8 pickled artichoke hearts (canned are fine)    1 medium cucumber, trimmed and cut into eighths    4 hard-cooked eggs, cut in half.    1.

He thinks traditional agricultural interests and environmentalists can be friends, working together toward changes in land use that benefit both interests.    Martinelli's family has been farming just north of Bolinas since the 1930s. He didn't plan to follow in his father's and grandfather's footsteps, but rather studied English and history at the University of California at Berkeley.    The pull of the land, however, won out over academia. Not long after graduation, Martinelli, now 36, was back in West Marin, tilling the soil and preaching the creed of the new environmentally sensitive farmer. He had a mentor of impeccable credentials: For nine years, he worked for Warren Weber, whose Star Route Farm, launched in the early '70s, was a trailblazer for a revitalized organic movement.    Martinelli, assisted by siblings and cousins, grows a variety of cool-werops _ potatoes, beets, carrots, lettuces (``no tomatoes or corn here,'' he jokes), garlic, chard, kale and winter squash _ on his family's 20 acres.    The squash are particularly dear to his heart. They thrive in the smket where his land is located _ it's a little more protected than most of the surrounding land and therefore just a smidgen warmer. The squash are also what he calls ``a low-life support crop'' _ from planting until harvest, they need little care. They don't attract insects nor do they require much water.    Butternut and delicata are the most popular varieties _ Martinelli says it's partly because of their sweetness and partly because they are manageable in size. Both those qualities appeal to his customers who come to the Martinelli booth at the Saturday farmers' market at Pt. Reyes Station and the Wednesday market in Fairfax. He also has a stand at Tomales Bay that's open Wednesdays through Sundays.    The large _ in some instances, humongous _ squash he grows are generally headed for the kitchens of his restaurant clients, who include Manka's in Inverness, Insalata's in San Anselmo, and Chez Panisse and Cafe Rouge in Berkeley.    Restaurant chefs love to deal with these big boys _ kabocha, turban and banana, and the giant, curved Tahitian squash that resembles a butternut squash on growth hormones.    Martinelli intends to plant more varieties in the future, although he has already come at least half-circle. Historically, the ranch, established in the 1870s, was first a dairy and apple farm. His family started out raising beef cattle on the land, and then he turned it into a vegetable farm.    He now feels that mixed use _ cattle and vegetables _ is probably the most ecologically sound, allowing for on-site recycling of just about all the byproducts of farming.    Martinelli's political fervor has not abated as his views have evolved. He lobbies government to provide incentives to family farms so a healthy farm belt can survive around towns and cities. And he is dedicated to guiding consumers back to the once prevalent belief that fresh food, lovingly grown in close proximity to its markets, delivers optimal taste and nutrition.

But not everyone knows what to do when confronted by silverware, napkin, fresh bread, salt and pepper _ and a bottle of olive oil.    You try to figure why there is no butter on the table, and what you are supposed to do with the oil?    Hey, it's easy. Just pour the oil on your bread. If you get a small saucer, pour the oil on the saucer and dip your bread. Pour directly or dip. Either way is OK. If there is one plate of oil for the whole table, just share, family-style, politely.    More and more restaurants, especially Italian ones, are adopting the Mediterranean tableau, serving olive oil as a regular condiment, leaving the butter in the kitchen.    If you have to have bread and butter too, don't hesitate to ask. In most restaurants, the customer is always right.    But when the oil is there, consider pouring it on your bread, or drizzling on top of a hearty vegetable soup or grilled vegetables.    Restaurateur Michael Hirschberg remembers shocking his staff 10 years ago when he said he wanted to put olive oil instead of butter at the table at his Ristorante Siena.    ``The waiters reacted in horror. I might have said we are going to put rat poison on the table,'' Hirschberg said.    Now that restaurant is Mistral and there still is olive oil, with a pour spout, at every table. Mistral serves 100 lunches a day, and gets maybe one or two requests for butter.    ``People seem to understand. Some people pour it on to the bread, others on the plate and dip. I don't know if there is a proper way,'' Hirschberg said.    Marin County olive oil maven Nan McEvoy pours her signature oil into soup and onto fresh bread. Healdsburg olive oil producer Ridgley Evers likes drizzling his on fresh fish or delicately cooked French lentils.    The point of fine olive oil is that it enhances the taste of the food.    Save the very best as an exquisite flavoring in butternut squash soup, over grilled vegetables or dotted on gently steamed fava beans, Evers said.    ``There is no one best oil. You should buy an inexpensive oil to cook with and you should use a series of very good oils to finish with. You will end up with better flavor, less fat and spending less money,'' he said.    As the wine connoisseurs like to say: Try it. Your opinion is the most important one.    (The Press Democrat in Santa Rosa, Calif., is part of the New York Times Regional Newspaper Group.)

Previously, U.S. marine products businessmen in co-operation with hotels in Shanghai hold a seafood festival, providing consumers menus with U.S food in Chinese. U.S. farm produce businessmen are holding the seafood festival as China will soon enter the WTO. According to customs statistics from January to July, U.S. edible oil seeds, frozen meat, and milk and butter goods passing through Shanghai customs respectively increased 68.2 percent, 219. 7 percent and 80.5 percent over the same period of last year. Fruit and nuts, feather and down imports increased as high as 289 times and 56.6 times the figure for last year, respectively. At the same time, sturgeons which live in cold water have successfully reproduced in the Yangtze River. It is a favorable food in many Shanghai hotels together with Salmon from Alaska. Farmers planting water melons, oranges and apples in Anhui, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Shaanxi provinces are busy with registering trade marks, after seeing that Sunkist orange from the United States are well-sold because of its brand. With superior geographic position and better techniques, Shanghai has imported more than 300 kinds of seeds of vegetables and flowers. And now it grows 30,000 tons of overseas vegetables annually. Xu Yanming, owner of a sturgeons farm in northern Shanghai, said that due to the improvement of breeding techniques and the market demands, he has introduced several kinds of fish from cold areas. His 40,000-square-meter breeding pond has become the largest sturgeon breeding center in east China. Sturgeons sell at more than 200 yuan (about 12 U.S dollars) a kilogram but still cannot meet market demands. Shao Wangyu, professor with a WTO research center in Shanghai, said that Chinese and overseas farm produce compete with each other. The influx of overseas produce has given Chinese consumers more choices. He said Chinese farmers should increase market awareness and learn marketing strategies from their overseas counterparts. On March 23, shortly after China announced that it would lift restrictions on importing U.S oranges, Sunkist oranges began to roll into the Chinese market with a big publicity campaign. U.S. businessmen plan to export 500 million yuan worth of Sunkist oranges to China in the coming five years. The chefs from the United States are scheduled to teach 1,200 people in major cities such as Shanghai, Beijing, and Dalian in one year and a half. Greg Drescher, a senior official with the Culinary Institute of America, said the training program is funded by U.S. Department of Agriculture, and supported by over 30 U.S wheat, peanuts, wine, oranges and marine products companies.

Asia's largest marine specimen house will be set up next year in Qingdao. The house will collect some 1,000 samples of marine species found only in China. China has 18,000 km of coastline abundant in marine biological resources. The foundation stone for the building of a Sino-Israeli bromide company was laid on August 3 in Weifang in east Shandong Province. The 300-million-US-dollar joint venture is believed to be the largest of its kind in China. ANHUI: Work on expansion of the Huangshan Airport in the Huangshan Mountain, one of China's major tourist attractions in east Anhui Province, started recently. The expansion, scheduled to complete in two years, will enable the airport to accommodate medium-sized and large airliners such as Airbus 320s and Boeing 757s and more passengers. East China's Anhui Province has effectively turned more than 100,000 ha. of arid and desertified land into vegetated areas in the past decades. As a result, greenery has so far covered 32.4 percent of local arid and desertified land, whose grain yield has grown by 10 to 20 percent. JIANGSU: Recent surveys show that pollution of Lake Taihu in east Jiangsu Province has been worsening, due to a delayed pollution control work. Of the 777 major polluting enterprises in the Lake Taihu Valleys, 541 have not yet met the country's pollutant discharging standards. INNER MONGOLIA: Dozens of thousands of visitors are rushing to northern Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, where Genghis Khan had fought and lived, to evade the terrible sunstroke this year. Most cities in north China have been experiencing one of the hottest summers in history, however, temperature in Inner Mongolia is five degrees centigrade lower compared with Beijing and Tianjin.

THE QUEST FOR SAFER BARBECUE    The height of the barbecue season is not when anyone wants to hear about the hazards of eating meat with a nicely blackened crust hot off the grill. But scientists have long known that substances created when meat and poultry are cooked at high heat can cause cancer in animals and that there is some evidence that they may have the same effect on humans.    While health professionals still recommend cutting back on overall meat consumption, recent research suggests that there are more appealing ways to make grilled meat less hazardous. Some are common-sensical, like eating it rare (though this is not recommended for chicken or hamburger) or medium instead of well done, or cooking it at lower temperatures for shorter periods. But others are more startling, like sprinkling meat with tea powder, or mixing ground meat with cherries, or just marinating meat before cooking.    Clearly, scientists are now so aware of the potential risks that they are looking into every corner of the kitchen for solutions. But their research is in its earliest stages, so they are not really sure how or why some of these techniques work.    ``It's hard for scientists to say we don't know,'' said Dr. Mark G. Knize, a member of the Biology and Biotechnology Research Program at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in Livermore, Calif., who is conducting some of the research on the effects of marinades.    For whatever reason, though, he and other scientists have found that one of the most promising techniques for meat and poultry is marination. Done even briefly, it reduces the cancer-causing compounds called heterocyclic amines, or HCA's, formed when creatine in muscle meats reacts with amino acids at high temperatures. (Fish is much less a problem than meat or poultry.) But marination does nothing to reduce the level of other carcinogens that arise when fat falls on a fire and causes smoke.    Scientists have not yet deconstructed all their marinade ingredients to pinpoint the anti-cancer agents. They suspect that the antioxidants in certain foods like garlic, onions, chives, turmeric, thyme, rosemary and oregano, as well as vitamins C and E, are responsible.    In studies last year at the Cancer Research Center of Hawaii in Honolulu, three different sauces were used to marinate steaks overnight. One was a teriyaki sauce, another contained turmeric and garlic powder and the third was a commercial sauce made of honey, high-fructose corn syrup, vinegar, concentrated tomato juice, modified food starch, salt and seasonings. Four-ounce pieces of marinated and unmarinated steak were cooked on a propane gas grill for varying times at varying temperatures. The marinades were not reapplied during cooking.    The shorter the cooking time and the lower the heat, the lower the levels of the suspect amines in meats marinated in the teriyaki and turmeric sauces, compared with unmarinated meat. Steaks marinated in the commercial sauce and cooked similarly had much higher levels of the amines than the other marinated meats; the researchers said this may have been partly because the corn syrup and honey caused the steaks to burn and char faster and more extensively.    I conducted taste tests on the teriyaki and turmeric sauces. The turmeric marinade adds flavor to tender but otherwise tasteless steak, while the teriyaki makes meat slightly sweet, although the brown sugar it contains causes the meat to burn faster.    In a 1997 study at Lawrence Livermore, researchers marinated chicken breasts in a mixture including garlic, salt, citrus juice and olive oil that also contained considerable sugar, and they concluded that the sugar was probably responsible for an increase in one of the amines. Using sweet commercial barbecue sauces may be just the wrong thing.    Other researchers are looking into other antidotes. Dr. John Weisburger, director emeritus of the nonprofit American Health Foundation in New York, has done studies indicating that sprinkling tea powder, either green or black, on m

Not too many years ago, these heirloom tomatoes seemed doomed, pushed toward oblivion by generally picked-while-green hybrid Romas, hydroponically grown cluster tomatoes and a few other varieties of great uniformity, near-indestructibility and, for the most part, insipid flavor.    A few intrepid gardeners/conservationists tried to keep the old varieties alive, growing them in backyard plots and swapping seeds with like-minded tomato lovers. And they managed _ largely via farmers' markets _ to popularize these tomatoes that range from tiny cherries to whopping two-pounders and from green and yellow to rust and the hue of old Bordeaux wine.    Janet Brown is one of these tradition-minded growers who has parlayed a personal passion into a viable business. She now grows 30 varieties of heirloom tomatoes on her small family farm, AllStar Organics in Lagunitas (Marin County).    Brown has less than three acres under cultivation, but she grows enough to supply a number of high-end restaurants, natural food stores and central Marin's upscale grocery, Woodland Market in Ross.    Brown's farming career began _ depending on how you care to look at it _ either with a disaster or with serendipity.    Eight years ago, the software development company for which she worked went belly-up. Having gardened all her life, the Long Beach native who had lived and owned land in Marin for more than two decades, decided to say farewell to the corporate routine. ``I took a little risk,'' she admits of her move into for-profit organic gardening and food advocacy, ``But I didn't have much to lose. I could always go back.''    The valley where she lives with her husband, Marty Jacobson, is ringed by trees and has its own microclimate. She calls it a warm bowl, although its cool nights slow things down to the point that her harvest is starting in earnest just about now. She expects her tomatoes to be at their prime around September 8, though she and her husband _ sometimes assisted by son Bo, 19 _ expect to harvest three times a week until Halloween.    There are a few early varieties, but most heirloom tomatoes tend to ripen late, unlike the hybrids that fill supermarket bins and which were developed for early harvesting.    Brown explains that an heirloom tomato is not only a fruit that has not been genetically altered, but one that has gone through the hands of at least four generations of gardeners.    Gardeners, she says, have kept meticulous records for a long time. Genetic diversity, she says, is best preserved when a maximum number of people cultivate a certain plant, not when huge companies control the market by patenting DNA.    Brown cites an example of survival: In 1994 she planted a tomato named 1894 after the year of a calamitous flood in the Ohio River Valley that wiped out crops. But somewhere nearby, the valley's traditional tomato survived and the seeds were returned to the valley and have been nurtured since.    Passionate about sustainable agriculture and preserving our agricultural heritage, Brown splits her time between her farm and Berkeley's Center for Ecoliteracy.    She also finds time for the Marin Food and Agriculture Project and its gleaning program. This grass-roots endeavor shows middle and high school students how to gather produce that's left in organic gardens and farms after the official harvesting is done _ the likes of baby spinach leaves and parts of other crops that are either too small or too tall to be garnered in regular harvesting.    Farmers, Brown says, can't afford to pay crews to pick these leftover vegetables, yet gleaners can collect hundreds of pounds of perfectly good produce that is then given to the Marin Food Bank or soup kitchens. Working a typical four-hour shift, a school class of about 30 youngsters averages 1,000 pounds of vegetables, she reports.    Brown says proponents of organic gardening like herself are h

By the time Confucius wrote about them in the fifth century B.C., they were a staple crop in Asia.    Today, radishes turn up in Mexican, Indian, Chinese, Japanese, Thai, North African, French, Italian and Russian cookbooks, but they are barely on the culinary radar in this country.    In France roasted radishes are a delicious addition to a vegetable ragout with carrots and white beans. In Japan, radishes are braised in dashi, sake and soy sauce as a bracing side dish for fish or meat. In India, shredded radishes are seasoned with chilies, ginger and toasted spices to make a filling for paratha.    Even when used raw, radishes get better treatment elsewhere. In Mexico, they are paired with avocado and lime juice in a simple salad of contrasting flavors and textures. Greek restaurants offer sliced radishes with fennel for scooping a feta cheese dip.    Radishes are thought to have been cultivated in Europe since the late Stone Age. The ancient Egyptians grew them for the oil that could be pressed from the seeds.    Despite this history, Americans barely bother with radishes. Although the consumption of fresh vegetables is on the rise over all in the United States, sales of radishes have actually declined slightly.    ``There's so much pressure to get exotic fruits and vegetables on store shelves that the radish is being squeezed out a bit,'' said Ron Schut, the president of Miedema Produce in Hudsonville, Mich., one of the country's largest radish wholesalers.    This is surprising considering that radishes are available year-round, with local supplies in summer and crops from Florida and Arizona in colder months. And specialty radishes are turning up more often. Farmers' markets this time of year sell every type, from dainty French breakfast radishes, elongated versions that shade from bright red at the stem end to white at the root, to the sturdy daikon, which can grow to a foot or more and weigh more than two pounds.    Then there are the very mild Easter egg radishes, which come in various shades of red, pink, purple and ivory. Icicle radishes are white like the daikon but much smaller, usually about the size and shape of your thumb.    Any of these are good raw, with a little salt or butter, eaten out of hand or on bread. But cooking literally transforms them, eliminating any pepperiness. When braised for 10 minutes, even the hottest radish loses its sting. What's left is pure radish flavor.    As an added bonus, the alabaster flesh of the standard red radish turns rosy pink. Pairing radishes with sauteed shallots and a drop of honey actually makes them taste sweet.    Like other root vegetables, radishes also take well to roasting. Radishes emerge caramelized and tender from a hot oven. Tossing the radishes with a little soy sauce as they finish cooking creates a syrupy glaze and seasons them perfectly. &QL;    Raw radishes are often as peppery as a chili, especially in summer. The heat comes from mustard oils, or isothiocyanates, not capsaicin, the fiery substance in chilies.    Mustard oils, compounds that provide flavor and aroma, are found in varying amounts in all cruciferous vegetables, a family that, in addition to radishes, also includes kale, broccoli, cabbage and turnips. Isothiocyanates are most prevalent in radishes, horseradish, mustard greens and turnips.    Dr. Jeffrey Brecht, a professor of postharvest physiology at the University of Florida in Gainesville, said the compounds are volatile and their effect lasts only a few seconds. ``Cooking drives off the isothiocyanates very quickly,'' he said.    Even raw radishes can be tamed, though. Try mixing several cups of sliced radishes with chopped oranges, a little extra virgin olive oil and some paprika to make a juicy Moroccan salad, perfect with grilled fish or chicken, or with sandwiches at lunch.    If you have an hour or so, turn radishes into quick Asian-flavored pickles

And there's no better way to do it than with a kebab sampling.    You can make the portions on each kebab as small or as large as you'd like. And feel free to create your own combinations, pairing favorite meats with preferred veggies or even fruits, like prunes, figs, apricots and peaches.    There are really only a few rules to keep in mind. It's good if you can intersperse lean meat cubes with fatty, and cut pieces about the same size so they will cook evenly. When using different vegetables on the same skewer, make sure they have similar cooking times; longer-cooking vegetables may be blanched first to start the cooking.    Experiment with different skewers, metal or wood. You can usually find economical versions at grocery and discount stores. The latest Williams-Sonoma catalog offers stainless steel skewers adorned with brass handles in the shape of animals. A set of six is $15.    If you use wood skewers, soak them in water for about an hour before using to keep them from burning while on the grill. You can also wrap the ends in foil. It's also a good idea to grease the grilling grate generously to prevent sticking.    One trick: Use a kebab rack. These stand about 2 inches high, and you place the skewers on top so they are just above the grate, but not touching it. We spotted one at Stein Mart for $14.99.    Finally, the last trick to kebabs is the unskewering. As he traveled the world sampling kebabs, cookbook author Steven Raichlen discovered the best way to handle this dilemma.    He suggests holding a skewer with one hand, and then, with a piece of thick bread in the other, pull the meat toward you a bit to loosen; everything should just slide off.    Below, we give you a few of the international recipes Raichlen discovered while working on ``The Barbecue! Bible'' (Workman Publishing, $18.95) plus some others we tried.    MAIN DISH    Madeira Beef and Bay Leaf Kebabs (Espetada)    Makes 4 servings Preparation time: 20 minutes Marinating time: 4-6 hours Cooking time: 8-12 minutes    Grilled beef is popular throughout Portugal, but on the island of Madeira, this kebab is the favorite. It used to be cooked directly on branches from bay leaf trees. Here, we stick with the leaves. Steven Raichlen recommends serving with crusty bread for soaking up the juices as shown below.    1 1/2pounds beef tenderloin or boneless sirloin    1/4cup extra-virgin olive oil    1/4cup red wine vinegar    1onion, finely chopped    1/2cup chopped fresh Italian (flat-leaf) parsley    4cloves garlic, finely chopped    1teaspoon salt    1teaspoon freshly ground black pepper    12bay leaves    Trim any sinews and excess fat off the beef, then cut the meat into 1 1/2-inch cubes. Combine the olive oil, vinegar, onion, parsley, garlic, salt and pepper in a large nonreactive baking dish. Add the beef and toss thoroughly to coat. Cover and let marinate in the refrigerator for 4 to 6 hours.    Preheat the grill to high. Remove the beef and bay leaves from the marinade and thread onto the skewers, dividing the bay leaves among the kebabs. When ready to cook, oil the grill grate. Arrange the kebabs on the hot grate and grill, turning with tongs, until the meat is cooked to taste, 2 to 3 minutes per side (8 to 12 minutes in all) for medium-rare. Baste the espetadas with any excess marinade, but not during the last 3 minutes. Serve the espetadas on or off the skewers on slices or chunks of Portuguese bread for soaking up the juices.

The next quick fix    As Americans learn more about food but cook less, Trotter predicts chefs will become the next quick fix.    In mid-February Trotter will open Trotter to Go, a mile from his restaurant. The take-out concept will feature spit-roasted organic birds, loins of meat, 35 types of grain, noodle and marinated vegetable salads, a 100-bottle esoteric wine section, breads and pastries plus a ``juice bar element.''    ``If you don't have time to cook and maybe you've never really learned to cook and here's a Wolfgang Puck frozen pizza, I've heard of this guy and I've read a few articles about him in Bon Appetit, this is probably going to be pretty good.    ``Buy prepared foods a la Emeril Lagasse and you can expect southern New Orleans flare. A la Alice Waters and it's going to be organic and Provencal, clean and vegetable driven.    ``These chefs have kind of carved out these niches, and their reputation immediately signifies something. If you're not going to have time to cook at home, wouldn't it be great to have these products?''    Trotter's first foray into the home kitchen was successful. His Gourmet Cooking for Dummies (1997, IDG Books Worldwide) sold more than 100,000 copies.    Yet ``I'm not necessarily interested in the home cook,'' he says. ``My job is to put together the most flavorful food I can. I'm not trying to appeal to elite diners either. I'm just trying to stay true to a point of view and produce food that I personally would like to eat.    ``Now, if doing a certain dish at the restaurant involves rare, esoteric ingredients that would preclude the home cook from doing that dish, then I'm interested in taking that idea _ that combination of flavors _ and doing it in a greatly simplified way. But I'm not out there trying to rope in the mainstream. I can't think in those terms.''    Books by Trotter    - Charlie Trotter's (Ten Speed Press, 1994) _ A behind-the-scenes look at the award-winning restaurant, with 72 recipes.    - Charlie Trotter's Vegetables (Ten Speed Press, 1996) _ Passionate about vegetables, Trotter focuses on the shapes and textures of vegetable artistry.

Not too many years ago, these heirloom tomatoes seemed doomed, pushed toward oblivion by generally picked-while-green hybrid Romas, hydroponically grown cluster tomatoes and a few other varieties of great uniformity, near-indestructibility and, for the most part, insipid flavor.    A few intrepid gardeners/conservationists tried to keep the old varieties alive, growing them in backyard plots and swapping seeds with like-minded tomato lovers. And they managed _ largely via farmers' markets _ to popularize these tomatoes that range from tiny cherries to whopping two-pounders and from green and yellow to rust and the hue of old Bordeaux wine.    Janet Brown is one of these tradition-minded growers who has parlayed a personal passion into a viable business. She now grows 30 varieties of heirloom tomatoes on her small family farm, AllStar Organics in Lagunitas (Marin County).    Brown has less than three acres under cultivation, but she grows enough to supply a number of high-end restaurants, natural food stores and central Marin's upscale grocery, Woodland Market in Ross.    Brown's farming career began _ depending on how you care to look at it _ either with a disaster or with serendipity.    Eight years ago, the software development company for which she worked went belly-up. Having gardened all her life, the Long Beach native who had lived and owned land in Marin for more than two decades, decided to say farewell to the corporate routine. ``I took a little risk,'' she admits of her move into for-profit organic gardening and food advocacy, ``But I didn't have much to lose. I could always go back.''    The valley where she lives with her husband, Marty Jacobson, is ringed by trees and has its own microclimate. She calls it a warm bowl, although its cool nights slow things down to the point that her harvest is starting in earnest just about now. She expects her tomatoes to be at their prime around September 8, though she and her husband _ sometimes assisted by son Bo, 19 _ expect to harvest three times a week until Halloween.    There are a few early varieties, but most heirloom tomatoes tend to ripen late, unlike the hybrids that fill supermarket bins and which were developed for early harvesting.    Brown explains that an heirloom tomato is not only a fruit that has not been genetically altered, but one that has gone through the hands of at least four generations of gardeners.    Gardeners, she says, have kept meticulous records for a long time. Genetic diversity, she says, is best preserved when a maximum number of people cultivate a certain plant, not when huge companies control the market by patenting DNA.    Brown cites an example of survival: In 1994 she planted a tomato named 1894 after the year of a calamitous flood in the Ohio River Valley that wiped out crops. But somewhere nearby, the valley's traditional tomato survived and the seeds were returned to the valley and have been nurtured since.    Passionate about sustainable agriculture and preserving our agricultural heritage, Brown splits her time between her farm and Berkeley's Center for Ecoliteracy.    She also finds time for the Marin Food and Agriculture Project and its gleaning program. This grass-roots endeavor shows middle and high school students how to gather produce that's left in organic gardens and farms after the official harvesting is done _ the likes of baby spinach leaves and parts of other crops that are either too small or too tall to be garnered in regular harvesting.    Farmers, Brown says, can't afford to pay crews to pick these leftover vegetables, yet gleaners can collect hundreds of pounds of perfectly good produce that is then given to the Marin Food Bank or soup kitchens. Working a typical four-hour shift, a school class of about 30 youngsters averages 1,000 pounds of vegetables, she reports.    Brown says proponents of organic gardening like herself are h

Spanning two years, the project will include adopting a logging ban to increase vegetation coverage areas and improve the grassland eco-system by controlling pests such as mice as well as planting grass on the more than 1,000 hectares of land.  China Plans to Limit Desert Expansion China's State Forestry Administration has drafted a plan that it hopes will limit desertification, which is one of China's most serious problems. The plan, if successful, would mean that the deserts would no longer expand 2,460 square kilometers a year, as happens now. Desertification could be curbed as early as 2010 or perhaps within 30 years, Forestry Deputy Director Li Yucai said at a recent seminar. China Sets up 73 Marine Nature Reserves China has set up 73 nature reserves off its coast in the past several decades to protect marine diversity from environmental pollution, excess fishing and other unfavorable influence. Wang Fei, director of the Marine Environmental Protection Department with the State Oceanic Administration, said Monday state-designated nature reserves aim to protect marine diversity under serious threat in the past four decades. The reserves, covering 140,000 ha, are located off the coast of the island province of Hainan in the tropical south to Liaoning Province in the northeast.  China Curbs Desertification for Beijing's Safety An emergency anti-desertification program has been launched in Inner Mongolia to ensure ecological safety of China's capital of Beijing and the nearby port city Tianjin. Twelve major duststorms have swept North China this year, including Beijing and Tianjin, with increased desertification in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region bringing direct economic losses of 1.5 billion U.S. dollars annually to the region in recent years.. The emergency program covers three deserts, one of which is just 180 kilometers away from Beijing, and moving toward the capital at an annual pace of 1.8 kilometers. Sino-U.S. Statement on Cooperation in Environment, Development Signed China and the United States has signed a joint statement on the environment and development cooperation between the two countries, the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology said Monday. The joint statement said the two countries believe that energy and environment constitutes one of the most important areas of cooperation between them. By making clean energy widely available through the development and application of new technologies and strengthening efforts to protect our environment and the earth's biodiversity, China-U.S. cooperation will contribute significantly toward further securing the welfare and quality of life of the people of the two countries, said the statement.

Eight million fruit trees blanketed Santa Clara County in the late 1940s, creating what Wallace Stegner once described as ``springs that were Milky Ways of blossom.''    Today those fruit trees have all but vanished, ripped out and replaced by houses, shopping malls, office buildings and high-tech campuses. Like family farms throughout the Bay Area, Santa Clara's farms couldn't compete with the development needs of a rapidly growing urban area. Although some observers cite the rise of farmers' markets as a positive omen for Bay Area farms in the future, no one suggests that the region will ever revert to its semi-agrarian past.    Yvonne Olson Jacobson, whose family grew cherries and apricots in Sunnyvale along El Camino Real, remembers a childhood spent in and under the trees.    ``My father would drive his truck into the orchard to get buckets of cherries from the pickers,'' she recalls. ``And if it was a hot day, you had the opportunity to ride under the cool trees. They were so big and leafy, and you were underneath all those luscious cherries, and you could just reach up and pick them off.''    Last month, 100 years after the Olson family began farming in Sunnyvale, bulldozers ripped out almost half of the family's remaining 24 acres. In a scene indicative of the past 50 years and the foreseeable future for Bay Area agriculture, 300 apartment buildings and a large retail complex will sprout on the site.    &LR; ``I was depressed awhile back,'' admits Deborah Olson, Jacobson's niece who has maintained the Olson farmstand and marketed the fruit in recent years. ``We have pictures, but now I'm going to have to say, `That's what it was. It was a ranch, and it's no longer going to be a ranch.' &LR;   &LR; ''    &LR; The Olsons are among the last holdouts from the days when El Camino Real was a country road surrounded by 125,000 acres of orchards and vineyards. As Silicon Valley grew, creating demand for housing and highways, farmers like the Olsons found their options eroding.    They could sell to developers and start over in the Central Valley, as many did. Or they could try to survive on fewer and fewer acres, as cities swallowed up their property for road expansions. In the face of these pressures, the county's orchard and vineyard land has dwindled to 5,000 acres.    Farther north, San Mateo County has witnessed a century of drastic change, too.    ``Serramonte Shopping Center was the biggest hog ranch in the county,'' says Jack Olsen, a San Mateo County Farm Bureau employee. According to the 1940 crop report, the county had 60,000 hogs and 16,000 acres of vegetables _ mostly peas, artichokes, Brussels sprouts and lettuce.    ``This was the breadbasket for San Francisco,'' Olsen adds. ``All the products had to be grown locally because you couldn't ship halfway around the world like you can today.'' Olsen says a 1920s photo on display in Daly City's Seton Medical Center shows all of Colma and Daly City in cabbage fields.    Today, the county can claim only 900 hogs and 3,300 acres of vegetables, but also 19 million square feet of greenhouses. Flowers and nursery plants now account for more than 75 percent of the county's agricultural production.    The population explosion following World War II sealed the fate of many San Mateo-area farms, says Mitch Postel, executive director of the San Mateo County Historical Museum. Many farmers took advantage of rising land prices to cash out. But surprisingly, the county's remaining agriculture bears the mark of a much earlier influence: the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882.    The ban on Chinese immigration created a void on turn-of-the-century farms. Who would do the manual labor? Eventually, Italian and Japanese immigrants replaced the Chinese and introduced the crops that prevail today. The Italians started small truck farms, planting artichokes, peas, fava beans, dandelion greens, cauliflower, spinach and chard. The Japanese too

The upward trend is the result of a rebound in the world economy and a surge in food consumption in many countries, Sanit was quoted today by local newspaper the Bangkok Post as saying. Thailand is among the world's five biggest exporters of food products. Its food exports were worth 141.7 billion baht (5.7 billion US dollars) in 1994, rising 5.8 percent to reach 149.87 billion baht (5.99 billion US dollars) in 1995. The target for this year is 163.54 billion baht (6.54 billion US dollars). Processed goods such as canned, frozen and dried marine foods account for about 70 percent of the total. Among other items are fresh and processed vegetables and fruit, and frozen poultry. Thailand is the world's chief exporter of frozen and canned shrimp and canned tuna, and the second biggest canned pineapple exporter after the Philippines.

But has it ever crossed your mind to toss a colorful array of fresh vegetables on the grill? If not, you'll be amazed at how simple, healthy and fabulous tasting grilled produce can be.    ``Most vegetables cook beautifully on the grill with just a minimum of preparation or attention,'' notes Kelly McCune in her ``Vegetables on the Grill'' cookbook.    ``We have been encouraging people to cook an entire meal on the grill for years, and finally people are coming around,'' says Betty Hughes, consumer affairs director for Weber-Stephen Products Co., the company that manufactures Weber grills. ``People are really missing out if they don't do vegetables on the grill.''    Grilling vegetables heightens their natural sweetness resulting in a fabulous smoky, carmelized flavor that is very different from those that are steamed, microwaved or boiled.    The smoky flavor is derived from the juices from the vegetables dropping down on the grill's heat source and thus cooking and carmelizing the sugars in the vegetables, says Hughes. ``You'll get the same smoky flavor whether you use a gas or charcoal grill.''    For more of a wood flavor add flavored wood chips to a gas grill, advises Hughes. Simply place wet chips in a small foil pan and put the pan in the hottest area of the grill underneath the cooking grates, which in Weber gas grills is in the front left hand corner. Don't place the food directly above the chips to avoid a flare up or a fire.    Experiment and learn what works best on your grill. Here are some tips for success _ gleaned from experts and our hands-on experience:    Vegetables are easiest to manage and hold their shape best when grilled in larger pieces. For instance, cut zucchini and eggplant (either Japanese or regular) into lengthwise slices rather than small pieces. Tomatoes are best grilled halved rather than in slices or quarters. Same goes for red, white or yellow onions and red, green or yellow bell peppers. Asparagus, mushrooms and green onions should be left whole.    To keep asparagus spears from falling through the cooking grates, use thicker spears or tie thinner spears together into bundles of five or six spears with plain kitchen twine.    There are several ways to grill corn on the cob. You can soak the husks in water for an hour and then place them on the grill or cook in the husks without soaking. Unlike other veggies, corn needs to be turned often when grilling. If desired, a couple of minutes before serving, peel back the husks to get a little brown color and grill marks on the corn, along with some additional smoky flavor.    For best results and fastest cooking, be sure the grill is very hot before adding the vegetables of your choice, emphasizes Hughes. Start a charcoal grill 30 minutes in advance of cooking or preheat a gas grill for 10 to 15 minutes.    The simplest and best way to grill vegetables is to brush them all over with olive or vegetable oil, and place on the grill. No blanching needed.    While we prefer to season with salt and garlic or regular pepper after grilling, some cooks like to toss the vegetables with oil, salt and pepper prior to grilling. Don't bother to marinate vegetables before grilling as they don't absorb much, if any, marinade.    For more flavor _ after grilling _ drizzle the produce with herb-flavored oils, dressings or marinades and fresh herbs, but go easy so the clean sweet flavors of the vegetables dominate. Hughes likes to add bottled vinaigrette dressing to a platter of grilled vegetables before serving as a side dish.

Kennedy Causeway, Wilbert Gohlke and his wife scrubbed out bait tanks they hope will soon be brimming with shrimp.    Gohlke, 70 and a veteran of four decades of wresting a living from the bays behind Clem's Marina, has a hunch Hurricane Bret did the Texas coast a favor.    ``Fishing and shrimping is good after a storm. I think all the water that comes in from the Gulf of Mexico, it's good. It cleans out all the dead water,'' said Gohlke.    Some of the state's top marine scientists predict Bret's massive infusion of freshwater will bring long-term, beneficial effects to South Texas bay systems normally closed off from freshwater and saltwater inflows. The flushing of the bays will mean more than just better sport fishing. Experts say a whole marine ecosystem of interdependent species, ranging from invisible plankton to ungainly brown pelicans, will be helped.    And the pesky brown tide, which has plagued Texas bays for nearly a decade, may have been flushed away.    But perhaps the most dramatic effect of the storm can be seen on beaches along the Gulf of Mexico. Bret's storm surge carved open 12 new channels through the barrier islands along the Gulf from Port Isabel to Corpus Christi, allowing huge quantities of fresh sea water to flood the bays.    ``Anytime you have a big storm event like this one _ and this storm Bret went right through the center of the Laguna Madre, dumped a lot of water, raised the tides to very high levels _ it has a big effect on the flushing of the Laguna Madre,'' said Ken Dunton, an associate professor at the University of Texas Marine Science Institute at Port Aransas.    Dunton, an expert in sea grass and coastal marshes, expects new and expanded growth of three of the five species of sea grass, which serve as a nursery for shrimp, crabs and fish. Those grasses _ shoal grass, manatee grass and wigeon grass _ are also an important food source for millions of ducks that winter in Texas bays.    ``The long-term benefits of increased freshwater inflows through a major event such as a hurricane to Texas estuaries far outweigh the short-term, negative effects. Long-term, you'll see increased habitat utilization by commercially important species of finfish and shellfish,'' including shrimp, blue crabs, trout, redfish and black drum, Dunton said.    One of the immediate short-term concerns is the heavy runoff from farm lands, which means increased nitrates that promote algae blooms such as brown tide. Other concerns are that larval marine life could have been flushed out of protective bays into the Gulf; sea grass could be covered in silt in areas near the new channels.    When Bret moved ashore late Sunday, huge quantities of rainwater were dumped directly into a number of South Texas bays with relatively high salt levels, rapidly lowering their salinity. As the storm moved inland, additional freshwater poured into the bays after draining into creeks, sloughs and rivers that form the watershed for the lower Laguna Madre, Baffin Bay, the Nueces estuary _ which includes Corpus Christi Bay, Nueces Bay and Redfish Bay _ and the Aransas estuary.    ``What that means is when you flush the system like that, you're carrying away a lot of material in the Laguna Madre that has been sitting there decaying for a long time, dead sea grasses and vegetation that has been rotting, and you're revitalizing the system,'' said Dunton, who has been studying the bay system for the last 13 years.    ``You're exposing substrates, or (bottom) areas that have not been exposed for a while, providing perhaps new opportunity for sea grass growth or growth expansion, through the removal of this dead and decaying material.''    Late last week, state wildlife biologists and officials from the Texas General Land Office were preparing to take aerial photographs of Gulf beaches where Bret cut a dozen new channels above and below the Port Mansfield cut, which divides North and South Padre Isla

During his visit in northern Thailand's Chiang Rai on Monday, Than Shwe held talks with Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai. The two sides agreed to enhance the two countries' cooperation in narcotics suppression, including cracking down on drug trade and illicit trafficking in the infamous Golden Triangle area bordering Myanmar, Thailand and Laos. The talks also covered issues on settlement of border dispute, and the two sides agreed to tackle the marine and fishing dispute between them through negotiation. Than Shwe, accompanied by Chuan, also visited a Thai crop substitution plantation project in Chiang Rai where large areas of opium have been successfully replaced by cash crops such as vegetables and fruits. Than Shwe also called on Thai King Bhumibol Adulyadej in Bangkok during his visit. Than Shwe's 40-strong entourage included SPDC First Secretary Lieutenant-General Khin Nyunt, Foreign Minister U Win Aung and four other ministers.

But my three-bean salad is really something entirely different, a simple composition of dried beans and fresh beans: a base of pureed white beans is infused with truffle oil, topped with a mixture of fresh beans in a vinaigrette and finished with field greens or fresh herbs.    The key to success is your bean technique. Dried beans must be properly rehydrated and then gently simmered, never boiled. If you boil the heck out of beans, they tend to explode. Soaking them in warm water and then gradually bringing the cooking liquid up to a gentle heat insures even cooking and intact beans. Add salt toward the end of cooking rather than at the beginning, or it will inhibit rehydration.    The salad works well with any fresh beans _ Blue Lake, haricots verts, yellow wax, fava, lima or cranberry beans, to name some possibilities _ cooked until they are firm but give no resistance to the teeth. To cook fresh beans _ or any green vegetable, for that matter _ I use a technique I call big-pot blanching: cook your vegetable in so much water that the water does not lose its boil when you add the vegetables. Your water should be heavily salted, about a half cup for each gallon. The result is a vegetable of the brightest possible color.    If you've cooked your beans properly, you almost can't go wrong with this salad. Feel free to experiment with the vinaigrette: wine vinegars (sherry, red or Champagne) or balsamic are good choices. I love to serve it throughout the summer when we have abundant varieties of ``fresh from the garden'' beans. It's seasonal, elegant and fun _ an interpretation of a salad bar standard that's worthy, I think, of haute cuisine. &QL;   &QL;  THREE-BEAN SALAD  &QL;    Time: 2 hours, plus overnight soaking of beans  &QL;   &QL;    1 cup dried marrow beans or other white beans, soaked in 4 cups water at room temperature overnight    5 cups plus 2 tablespoons vegetable stock or canned vegetable broth    1 shallot, peeled and halved, plus 1 teaspoon minced    1 small carrot, peeled    Bouquet garni: 3 sprigs parsley, 1 sprig thyme and 1 bay leaf, wrapped in two 5-inch sections of leek greens and tied with string    Kosher salt and freshly ground white pepper    4 to 5 tablespoons white truffle oil    2 teaspoons sherry wine vinegar    1 cup trimmed haricots verts in 1-inch pieces    1 cup trimmed yellow wax beans in 1-inch pieces    { cup shelled, peeled fava beans    1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil    1 teaspoon lemon juice    2 cups frisee or baby greens, for garnish.    1 tablespoon peeled, seeded, diced tomatoes    1. Prepare the bean puree: Drain the white beans. In a large saucepan or casserole, combine the beans with 4 cups of water. Place over low heat, and bring to a simmer. Remove from the heat, and allow the beans to rest for 5 minutes. Remove any beans that float to the surface. Drain, and chill under cold running water. Return the beans to the saucepan, and add 5 cups of the vegetable stock, shallot halves, carrot and bouquet garni. Place over low heat, and simmer for 20 minutes.    2. Add \ teaspoon salt, and continue to cook until the beans are completely tender, 25 to 30 minutes. There should still be some liquid remaining in the pan. Place a strainer over a bowl, and drain the beans, reserving the liquid. Remove and discard the carrot and bouquet garni. Using a food processor, begin to puree the beans. With the machine running, slowly add the reserved liquid through the feed tube, adding just enough to make a smooth puree. Next, pass the puree through a tamis or drum sieve. Measure 1 cup of puree into a mixing bowl, and set aside the remainder for another use. Whisk in the remaining 2 tablespoons vegetable stock, 2 tablespoons of the truffle oil and 1 teaspoon of the vinegar. The puree should have a creamy consistency; add 1 more tablespoon of truffle oil if desired. Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Earlier Friday, the Mariners lost the longest game in Kingdome history, a 9-8 series-sweeping, soul-crusher to the Cleveland Indians. They left 20 men on base over 17 innings. Two more and they could played the Seahawks here next weekend.    In the evening, they had to face the New York Yankees, a team so powerful they have applied for a seat on United Nations Security Council.    But most significantly, they had a lose-lose situation with Randy Johnson and the trading deadline. As the excruciating hours dwindled down, the silence that enveloped the franchise seemed to signal that the club had no shot at doing anything that would be perceived as a win.    They weren't going to get full value for one of the most dominating pitchers in the game. And if he were not traded, management would perpetuate the stink that has hung over this club since Opening Day, as well as create the impression the aroma will continue once Johnson leaves as a free agent after the season with nothing in return.    So after nine months of holding Johnson, the club and its fans hostage to its aimlessness, management finally ended the saga _ but not the controversy.    They traded the biggest Unit to the Houston Astros for two diminutive units _ a minor league pitcher and a minor league infielder, each of whom are known primarily by their mothers, a few scouts and a couple of Houston barbecue joints.    Also included is a player to be named. If it is Jeff Bagwell, management is off the hook. Since it won't be, the Mariners have kissed off the 1998 season.    While hardly an unusual move in baseball, the abandonment of the race at the trading deadline is the first here since people started caring about the team. For those new to the ritual, it requires:    1) overripe vegetable matter;    2) an arm better than the pitcher who will replace Johnson;    3) grocery-sack headgear;    4) new-found passion for Seahawk exhibition games.    Not since Tim Floyd showed up to coach the Chicago Bulls has there been a sporting constituency left with such a flim-flammed feeling.    A week full of rumors of veteran, immediate help fueled expectations that the Mariners will come out of this self-made ordeal almost whole, particularly since the Yankees were indeed ready to deal Hideki Irabu.    But the Mariner price _ Irabu and third-base prospect Mike Lowell _ proved too steep even for the loaded Yankees, because there was no guarantee Johnson would sign with them after the season. They bailed out early in the evening, as did apparently every other team offering major leaguers.    So in the short term, the Mariners ended up with the worst of all possible arrangements _ no Johnson and no immediate help.    The desperation of July was a direct descendant of last winter's decision to stand pat. The flawed decision was a surprising tactic, given that they had won just one playoff game in the previous two seasons.    The longer term is, of course, unknowable. Management is counting on the good grace of its fan base to wait on 21-year-old Freddy Garcia and 22-year-old Carlos Guillen. But the credibility was already strained in the first moments when the club's press release identified the players as ``Freddy Garcia and Carlos Garcia.''    Perhaps the player to be named is another Garcia _ Jerry. At least he used to play a little third bass.    The good grace of its fan base was already stretched thin, because knowledgable fans understand that Garcia and Guillen are replacing prospects from earlier seasons squandered on trades for veterans in failed attempts to reach the World Series.    Mariner manager Lou Piniella admitted as much.    ``I'm sure we tried to get players who fit here immediately,'' he said. ``Obviously it didn't work out. We gave up young prospects to enhance our situation before. Houston is doing the same

I just carrots, turnips, garlic, and placed it in a roasting pan, surrounded by more vegetables. Those inside helped keep the breast moist; those outside roasted slowly in the fat.    After covering the duck with foil, I began roasting it in a very hot oven _ 500 degrees _ for 10 minutes, and then dropped the heat to a temperature even lower than what I use to toast nuts, to 300 degrees. Then I roasted it for four and a half hours, the last hour without the foil, to crisp the skin.    What came out of the oven was a revelation. The duck had nearly collapsed under its own weight. Its skin had given up most of its fat and had reduced to a thin, chewy layer, the color of caramel. The meat, moist and slippery like buttery rillettes, fell from the bone. The vegetables had cooked tender in the duck fat, shrinking a little. I had hardly done a thing, and my oven did not look as if a fat bomb had exploded in it.    But divine as it was, it had a rival.    I had called Nina Simonds, the author of several books on Chinese cooking, including ``Asian Wraps'' (William Morrow, $23), to ask her how to make Peking duck, prepared with the skin separated from the flesh and the entire duck coated in maltose syrup and then hung to roast. It's difficult to do at home, she told me, and instead she suggested a Sichuan dish called ``crispy skin duck.'' The name was all I needed to hear.    The duck is marinated in rice wine, scallions, ginger, star anise and Sichuan peppercorns. Then it is steamed whole in a covered wok for nearly two hours. As it steams, its fat melts, falling into the water, and the meat relaxes until it weeps.    At this point, the challenge is to refrain from eating it as is (it could, in fact, be served like this without the skin). Steaming forces the aroma of scallions, ginger and peppercorns to permeate the bird like a vanilla bean infusing warm cream.    I forged on. Ms. Simonds' recipe next instructs you to coat the entire duck in soy sauce and cornstarch, and then to fry it whole in peanut oil. ``Traditionally, it's deep-fried twice, and it gets so crisp,'' she said. ``But who wants to bother with that?''    Who wants to bother with that once? This seemed not only dubious, but also frighteningly messy. I did just half the bird.    It was delicious, indeed, and incredibly crunchy. But the mess was as awful as I had imagined. My sofa across the room still smells of duck a week and a half later.    For the remaining half, I went back to the Union Square Cafe method of pan-roasting it at the last minute. As the pieces touched down on the pan, they sizzled and immediately began crisping and browning. And by the time they emerged from the oven, they looked as if they'd been lacquered.    The duck was perfect: the skin was crisp and deliciously salty, the meat was moist, and its rich flavor had melded completely with the scallion, ginger and peppercorns.    And I was speechless.

If you plan to use them within a week or two, you might want to purchased the refrigerated salsas, which are fresher tasting but not as convenient. Salsas of all varieties (tomato, pineapple, mango and the like) lend themselves to adding Tex-Mex and other flavors to skillet creations, dips, rice, cold bean and corn salads, salad dressings and more. Also use salsa to top grilled chicken breasts, steaks and the like. And of course, it's a great dip with chips when you have nothing else on hand.    FROZEN VEGETABLES: Keep a supply of lots of different single vegetables as well as combinations to use in salads, soups, stir-fries and more. Some favorites include corn for chowder, sugar snap peas and various combinations for stir-fries, assorted strips of red, green and yellow peppers, baby peas and haricots verts. I like the quality of some of the Trader Joe's offerings.    FROZEN FRUITS: Lots of possibilities are available including pineapple, raspberries, strawberries, mango, melons and assorted fruits to make into quick fruit salads or compotes (serve topped with cottage cheese for a light dinner during summer), cobblers or pies. Single fruits or combinations are also great whirred into smoothies for breakfast or a snack or pureed for sauces for ice cream, cake or waffles. Try processing frozen raspberries with tofu in a food processor for a quick frozen dessert.    SHREDDED CHEESES: Keep several kinds (flavor- and fat-wise) _ including some of the blends _ ready to add to tostadas, lasagna, casseroles, salads, pizzas, sandwiches or English muffins. The larger the bag, the bigger the price break. Once opened, these cheeses have a tendency to lose freshness faster than a large block of cheese.    ROASTED RED PEPPERS: Available in jars (Mezzetta brand is my preference), these are wonderful for those in a hurry. Rinse and drain them, then puree in a food processor for sauces or dips or cut them up and toss in soups, salads, sandwiches and main dishes. Also try marinating pieces in oil, vinegar and a little garlic and serve as part of an Italian antipasto platter. Once you get in the habit of using the bottled, you may never go back to roasting your own.    CANNED GREEN CHILES: Available whole or diced, these give a flavor boost to dips, quesadillas, rice, chiles rellenos, sauces, chili, pizzas, entrees of all kinds and more. Whenever I whip up a crustless quiche for brunch or dinner, I pour beaten eggs mixed with a little milk or cream and seasoned with chiles and seasoned salt and garlic pepper over plenty of shredded cheese in a pie plate. Bake until set and you're in for some tasty dining.    CANNED AND BOTTLED OLIVES: I keep all colors and flavors of pitted olives handy for tapenades (made in no time flat in the food processor) as well as to embellish casseroles and, particularly, salads and pasta dishes. The tapenades can be mixed with cream cheese for a dip, spread on rustic bread slices to accompany soups and more.    ARTICHOKE HEARTS: I prefer the canned to frozen (which I find watery and flavorless). Buy quartered and rinse and drain well (I add a sprinkling of red wine vinegar and drain well to get rid of the canned taste) before adding to cold marinated vegetable or pasta salads. Also great in baked artichoke cheese dip. You'll find many ways to use them.    PACKAGED ROASTED REFRIGERATED CHICKEN BREASTS: What a fabulous and convenient shortcut. To save money, I purchase these at a warehouse store (Tyson brand) where they are in the neighborhood of $10-$12 per package of 6 or so breasts. Remove the skin and bones and slice, chop or cut in strips to use in the full gamut of dishes from soups and salads to entrees.

DEBUG:simuser.user.query_generators.srex_refined_query:raw text: AN ARGENTINE PASSOVER, THEN AND NOW     Passover comes in the fall in the Southern Hemisphere, but even for a gaucho judio in the pampas, the eight-day holiday means what it does for most Jews in the United States: gefilte fish with horseradish, chicken soup with matzoh balls and roast chicken.    But there, cooks are much more involved in the preparations. Only recently have they had access to store-bought Passover staples.    Buenos Aires is home to the largest concentration of Jews in Latin America, and Argentina has the seventh-largest Jewish population by country in the world: 206,000. Most came fleeing the pogroms of Russia, although about 15 percent are Sephardic, from Syria, Turkey and North Africa.    Unlike Eastern European immigrants to the United States, however, many of the earliest settlers were farmers. Diego Guelar, the Argentine ambassador to the United States, said his great-grandfather arrived from Lithuania in 1891 with the Jewish Colonization Association of Paris, a fund established by the philanthropist Baron Maurice de Hirsch to create Jewish agricultural colonies in Argentina.    Like a few of these Jewish cowboys, the Guelars stayed on the land, eventually swapping farming for cattle breeding.    From his home in Washington, Guelar recalled that at his childhood Passovers on a ranch in Entre Rios Province, about 400 miles northeast of Buenos Aires, roast chicken was on the menu, along with Eastern European recipes like potatoes stuffed with ground beef and onions.    These are called chremslach in Eastern Europe and albondigas de papas in Argentina. An avocado and lettuce salad replaces the asparagus served in the United States.    Until recently, most Passover dishes in Argentina were made from scratch. Very few of the kinds of products now taken for granted in this country were sold in stores. Guelar, who is 48, recalls how on his ranch the gefilte fish was made by hand-grinding carp, whitefish and pike, and then stuffing it into the skin of a large carp.    Today, with more kosher-for-Passover products available, like vinegar and oil, Argentines can eat their roast chicken marinated in chimichurri sauce, a garlicky blend of vinegar and spices. The recipe here is from Naomi Sisson, the wife of the Israeli Consul General in New York, who grew up in Rosario, in the province just northeast of Entre Rios.    Argentina is one of the few countries where kosher butchers provide the beef casings to make kishke, the Jewish holiday dish of intestines stuffed with potatoes, matzoh meal, eggs, chicken fat and spices.    ``Once, there were 50 kosher butchers in Buenos Aires,'' Adolfo Maleh told me during a recent visit to Argentina. Now, he is one of the 20 or so remaining in the entire country. Maleh, who is Sephardic, makes beef chorizo at his Carniceria Simon in Once (pronounced OWN-say), traditionally the city's Jewish neighborhood.    The stores in Once and other neighborhoods now offer packaged products for Passover from Israel and the United States, like cake mixes and tomato paste and soups, as well as the local Yanovsky brand of matzoh and matzoh meal.    Many in the younger generation use these time-saving products, but the old-timers do not. Susana Shalalof, who has cooked for 35 years at Succath David, one of the few kosher restaurants in Buenos Aires, makes traditional Syrian dishes at home for Passover (the restaurant closes for the holiday).    Her stuffed vegetables, from a recipe brought by her parents from Syria, are filled with beef or lamb, rice and pine nuts, seasoned with cumin, allspice and cinnamon and served in a sauce of tomato, tamarind and cinnamon, all ingredients permissible at Passover for Syrian Jews.    Unlike cooks in this country, Mrs. Shalalof, like most Argentines, doubles the amount of beef in her traditional recipes for Passover, and throughout the year.

After all, this was his first trip to the United States and he had only seen the John F. Kennedy Airport, downtown Schenectady and points in between.    A native of the East African nation of Tanzania, now with the Goteborg University in Sweden, Mlima was one of more than 200 of the world's top economists attending the North American Productivity Workshop, held recently at Union College. The opening banquet of the three-day seminar, as Mlima would learn somewhere between the hors d'oeuvres and first entree course, was not American food, but authentic Thai cuisine.    Providing a six-course, 13-dish Asian repast as the opening meal, was one of many ways organizers at the small private college made a bookish seminar and trip to Schenectady attractive to the attendees from all parts of the globe.    Suthathip (Lek) Yaisawarng, chairwoman of the college's department of economics, co-chair of the event and a native of Bangkok, spent hours with the school's dining services staff teaching the finer points of cooking with ingredients such as black fungus (mushrooms) and makrood (kaffir lime leaves).    ``I liked to cook when I was child,'' said Yaisawarng, standing in the giant white tent erected for the feast in front of the Nott Memorial on the Union campus. ``I didn't know that I'd need to come back to it, and in such quantities!''    But early in the evening, dinner was proving to be a highlight of the workshop.    As a group of Union professors played Dixieland jazz, attendees juggled glasses of wine or bottles of beer and jostled each other for plates of fish cakes with cucumber sauce. They conversed in English, but the language came with a variety of heavy accents, including German, French, Australian, Arab, and even Southern. The delegates hailed from at least 30 countries, including New Zealand, Bangladesh, Hungary, Belgium and Japan.    Cocktail hour was followed by a soup course, which, though plenty spicy for some, was tame by Nostratollah Nafar's standards. Nafar, a professor at Allameh Tabatabai University in Tehran, Iran, added ground chili peppers by the tablespoon to his bowl.    More familiar with both Asian and American cuisine than Mlima, Nafar explained, ``Chinese food not hot, it's sweet.''    It is important that people eat together, meet socially and form personal relationships at events like this so when they get into a session, they are more likely to open up and make the conference more productive, said Yaisawarng.    If Mlima was disappointed to not be dining on New York strip steaks and New England clam chowder at his first major feast in America, it didn't last long.    As the servers brought bowls of lime sorbet between entree courses, Nafar exclaimed, ``Here's American food _ ice cream!''    ___    THAI SPRING ROLL WITH SWEET AND SOUR SAUCE    2 tablespoons vegetable oil    3 cloves freshly chopped garlic    1 cup very lean ground pork    3 cups julienned carrot    2 packages cellophane noodles    2 ounces dried Chinese black mushrooms    1/2 cup chopped green onion    1/2 teaspoon black pepper    2 tablespoons Thai soy sauce    1 pack spring roll wrappers    2 tablespoons cornstarch mixed with 2 tablespoons water    Vegetable oil for deep frying    2 cups spicy sweet and sour sauce    1 cup vinegar    1/2 cup water    1/3 cup fresh cilantro leaves    Heat 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in frying pan.

Winter soups, with their soothing richness and beef-vegetable, chicken-noodle, chowder, minestrone.    But summer soups refresh rather than soothe. And with so many vegetables hitting their peak of freshness, my first urge for summer soups is to isolate each one and make it more than what it is on the vine, to refine it to its purest form. (An exception is a bright gazpacho, whose many flavors blend into a single taste.)    The beauty of summer soups _ one main ingredient served hot or cold _ is that they're so easy. Zucchini, spinach, tomato, bell pepper: the less you change them, the better.    The technique for all vegetables is the same; learn it and you can transform any vegetable into an extraordinary summer soup, whether it's pea or fennel, watercress or artichoke, tomato, carrot, haricots verts or even a soup of fine herbs, tarragon, chive, parsley and chervil.    It's just a matter of cooking your vegetable, pureeing it in a blender, adjusting the consistency with stock or water, seasoning it, and straining. Some vegetables, like tomatoes and cucumbers, don't need to be cooked.    The principle is simple: separate the flavor and color from what contains it, the cellulose. The tool that separates it is the chinois.    The chinois, a fine-meshed conical sieve, is critical to these soups. It creates the texture of luxury. The chinois combines layers of fine mesh that catch even the smallest particles of fiber, producing a finely textured liquid that feels like silk or satin. Certainly, you could heat your puree and serve it without straining, or you might pass it through a food mill and then through a strainer. But again, when you're looking for an essence of something, you must remove all the extraneous vegetable fiber that has no flavor.    My thinking about soups is so similar to my approach to sauces that I always wonder, is sauce a soup or is soup a sauce? Which came first? If it's a great summer soup, it can be a great sauce, too. And vice versa. Sometimes we'll make a sauce that tastes so good, we decide to put it in a cup and call it soup.    Soups are the most chameleonlike dishes. They can be served at any point during the meal _ as a canape, a first course, the perfect intermezzo, a dessert canape, the dessert or a sauce.    My favorite way is as opening canapes _ two or three spoonfuls of intense flavor presented in small white bowls before the meal begins. A canape soup excites the senses and prepares you for the meal ahead. And these summer soups make the very best canapes, because they focus on a single flavor. One sip of carrot soup should be as powerful in flavor as a mouthful of carrots.    Elements of finesse make a big difference. And cooking the vegetable well is one of them. All green vegetables should be cooked in so much water that the water does not lose its boil, water that has a cup of salt for every gallon, and the cooked vegetable must immediately be shocked in ice water. This big-pot blanching and chilling insures the brightest green possible.    Root vegetables and red and yellow bell peppers are simmered in a small amount of stock or cream, then blended.    Another element of finesse is introducing some sort of fat _ cream or oil _ to enrich the flavor and add body, although some vegetables, like cucumber and sorrel, require no fat. Perhaps you'll also want an acid like sherry or balsamic vinegar.    Some vegetables benefit from a secondary component (add a little blanched dill to the cucumber puree for cucumber soup, for instance). But ultimately, the great summer soup is a single cooked vegetable pureed and strained through a chinois.    Gazpacho is the perfect warm-weather soup, and the interpretation I offer here is intense, and easy. The main technique is turning on your blender, and then straining the liquid. The flavor is extraordinary because you're using fresh ingredients _ cucumbers, onion,

With all of the freshly prepared foods _ fresh salsa, cleaned and deveined shrimp, prewashed salad mixes and smoked tofu, just to name a few _ why not take advantage?    However, some pre-prepared foods are better than others. Many commercial pestos, for instance, have lost their fresh herbal flavor by the time you get them.    The trick is to find the best products. Pasta Etc. brand pesto, made in Sonoma, has no cheese or oil and is flavored with miso. That may not sound like pesto at all, but its bright basil flavor works very well in this week's Fast &AMP; Fresh recipe.    The recipe is simple but elegant enough for a dinner party because of the way it looks _ luscious pink salmon atop golden couscous, accented with green basil sauce. Quick pan-frying gives the fillets a crisp crust and moist interior, and the pesto sauce, mixed with lemon juice, cuts through the richness of the fish.    Another excellent prepared product is achiote paste. Widely used in Mexico's Yucatan region, this seasoning base is made of ground annatto seeds, spices, vinegar and sometimes garlic. Mixed with oil and additional seasonings, achiote is an instant marinade that gives intense flavor and an appealing saffron-red color to meat and fish.    In this week's 30-minute recipe, chicken breasts are marinated in achiote, then quickly broiled. The chicken is placed on top of a salad of crisp jicama and arugula dressed with lime juice and a touch of cayenne, bringing the vibrant marinade to life.    Like all lasagnas, the Now &AMP; Later recipe, Lentil and Butternut Squash Lasagna, involves many steps. But it's worth every minute you spend behind the stove.    A vegetarian dish created by my non-meat-eating friend Elisabeth, the lasagna brings together butternut squash, roasted until creamy, with firm French lentils and intensely sweet caramelized onions. A rich b &LR; e &LR; chamel sauce makes the layers float on top of each other like clouds.    When making a many-stepped recipe like Lentil and Butternut Squash Lasagna, do all the prep work ahead of time. Chop the vegetables and herbs, measure the liquids and grate the cheese before you start cooking. Being organized allows you to cook many things at once instead of trying to chop while minding something on the stove.    If you like, break up the preparation by cooking the b &LR; e &LR; chamel and vegetables ahead of time, then layering the lasagna the next day. To reheat b &LR; e &LR; chamel, add a bit more milk and heat it slowly, stirring constantly. Do not allow it to boil.    &QL;  FAST &AMP; FRESH: dinner in about 20 minutes    &LR;  &QL;   &LR; PAN-FRIED SALMON FILLETS WITH LEMON PESTO &AMP; COUSCOUS    Ingredients:    6 tablespoons prepared pesto sauce (see note)    1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice    1 (10-ounce) package instant couscous    1/2 teaspoon salt + salt to taste    2 tablespoons + 1 teaspoon olive oil    4 boned skinless salmon fillets, 5 to 6 ounces each and 1-inch thick    Freshly ground pepper to taste    4 lemon wedges    Instructions:    If possible, let the pesto sit at room temperature for 20 minutes before beginning preparation.

What is worth-noting is that the output value from agriculture accounted for less than one percent of the total.

Oh, it's still possible to gorge yourself silly on around-the-clock dining alternatives. And some ships have yet to abandon the choco-holic buffet.    But following the trend on land, most cruise lines now offer heart-healthy options _ vegetarian entrees, sugar-free desserts, even complete low-fat, low-cholesterol and low-sodium meals.    Aboard Celebrity's five ships, nightly ``Lean and Light'' full menus may include this recommendation: a shrimp cocktail, chilled gin and tomato consomme with straw mushrooms, veal scaloppine with lemon and frozen lemon yogurt with dark cherries.    Total calories: 782. Total grams of fat: 9.    Other lines offer similar enticements.    From Princess' ``Healthy Choice'' menu: spaghetti in fresh basil and tomato sauce, roast pork tenderloin with a corn muffin and warm Mediterranean salad and lime sherbet.    From Royal Caribbean's ``ShipShape'' menu: melon balls with port wine, tossed romaine lettuce and plum tomatoes with fat-free creamy roasted garlic dressing, baked lobster with citrus sauce and, for dessert, a phyllo purse with pears and raspberry coulis.    From Silversea's ``Light and Healthy Cuisine'' selections: marinated Greek salad; marinated pan-fried scallops served with capellini pasta, carrots and broccoli; and ice coupe peach Melba with diet ice cream.    From the ``Light Selections'' aboard Radisson Seven Seas' Song of Flower: a strawberry cup; a salad with curry vinaigrette; steamed rock lobster tail enhanced with saffron bouillon, vegetable pearls and boiled potatoes; and a tropical fruit platter with diet ice cream.    Light cooking expert Jeanne Jones has created 20 new lacto-vegetarian selections for Windstar's four sailing ships. Among them: pear and gorgonzola pizza, herbed vegetable strudel, Moroccan sweet potato stew, Cajun pasta and enchiladas with butternut squash and corn.    Among vegetarian entrees served aboard Royal Caribbean ships: a five-layer vegetable tart served with red pepper puree, stir-fried Chinese vegetables with tofu and Caribbean curried vegetables with black beans.    Carnival, the world's largest cruise line, spices lunch and dinner menus with ``Nautica Spa'' items such as poached sole with red bean ratatouille, steamed whole red snapper in coconut water and lemon grass and a low-fat pumpkin pie. Meats, fish and poultry are roasted or broiled, salads are prepared with diet dressings and desserts with Sweet 'N Low or NutraSweet.    No mystery surrounds cruise lines' concentration on lighter, healthier cuisine: It's passenger demand.    Holland America officials cite these figures: In 1985, only 10 percent of that cruise line's passengers ordered fish when provided the option; today, almost 40 percent choose fish on Caribbean cruises and 50 percent order fish in Alaska. Another 10 percent order poultry.    As part of its ``Passport to Fitness'' onboard program, Holland America offers low-fat, low-calorie cuisine not only in its main dining rooms but also at buffets. A typical Lido Buffet salad bar includes 20 to 30 fresh items and a wide selection of light dressings. Cholesterol-free mayonnaise and other condiments are provided.    Waves of change are sweeping over other aspects of shipboard dining, too.

Times News Service for Wednesday, March 3: Bruce Aidells and his collaborator, Denis Kelly, has spent nearly a decade studying the state of meat in America to produce ``The Complete Meat Cookbook,'' published last November by Houghton Mifflin. Not only does it secure his image as a man unafraid of meat, even in these vegetable-revering times, but it also is rife with heretical ideas. ``Meat has changed in America,'' he said. ``We need to change the way we cook it.'' By Molly O'Neill.    With photo.    With recipes.    MEAT-MARINATE (Undated) _ Since the earliest days of recorded history, and maybe even before, humans have marinated their food, steeping meat, fowl and fish in some combination of liquid _ usually oil or acid _ and seasonings. At first, there were practical reasons: Tough meat needed to be made tender, it needed to be preserved, and, with humans ever attuned to improving their lot, it needed to be flavored. But from ranch to refrigerator, almost everything has changed about meat and the way it is treated today. Everything, that is, except marination. By Eric Asimov.    With recipes.    WINE-MICROWAVE (New York) _ A new question is creeping into wine service in New York: How do you want that cooked? For many years, Americans have confounded the rest of the world by drinking their white wines too cold and their red wines too warm. Sommeliers no longer hesitate when diners ask that a luscious Corton-Charlemagne be plunged into an ice bucket. They just do it. It's easy. Red wine poses a different problem. If it arrives at the table with slight chill, and the diners want it the temperature of a blood transfusion _ fast _ the sommelier must resort to wiles, and the wiliest wile of all, it turns out, is the microwave oven.

AND WORLD TIMES, INC. NO PORTION OF THE MATERIALS CONTAINED HEREIN MAY BE USED IN ANY MEDIA WITHOUT ATTRIBUTION TO WORLDSOURCES, INC.    IN an increasingly health-conscious world, ostrich meat has been dubbed ``the red meat of the future'' due to its low-fat, low-cholesterol and high- protein content.    Having the reddish tinge and texture of tender beef and the taste of venison, ostrich meat is fast becoming popular among Malaysians due to promotional efforts by Government agencies, breeding farms and restaurants.    However, the meat, either imported or obtained from Malaysian farms, is currently available only at exclusive restaurants as supply has not been able to meet demand.    It is said that meat from ostrich reared on Malaysian farms can be expected to be sold to the general consumer in the next one or two years.    Some farms are in Hulu Jabor in Terengganu, Sungai Siput and Sungkai in Perak, Padang Serai in Kedah, Pantai in Negri Sembilan, Ulu Tiram in Johor, and Kota Belud and Papar in Sabah.    The Ti Chen Chinese Restaurant, open to the public and not just to members of the Saujana Golf and Country Club in Petaling Jaya where it is located, is holding an Ostrich Promotion until June 30.    Chef Kam Chan Siong says there are many possibilities with ostrich meat, be it in Western, Chinese, Malay or Indian cooking. As with beef, mutton and venison, you can have ostrich steak, kebab, satay, stew, stir-fried, curry and rendang.    Available a la carte for lunch and dinner, dishes include Stir-Fried Ostrich Meat with Ginger and Spring Onions, Ostrich Meat Claypot with Chinese Greens, Ostrich Meat Sizzling Platter with Barbecue Sauce, and Ostrich and Gingko Claypot.    If you can't get ostrich meat, use mutton, beef or venison instead.

He would take the cut, considered too humble to serve to the restaurant's guests, and slice it so that each piece had some of the firm, chewy meat and the flavor-giving bones. We would roast the lamb with garlic, dried fennel, and herbs, and, to a cook, the crew would love it.    These days, when lusty flavor is so much in demand, the neck of the lamb is as welcome in the dining room as it was in the kitchen.    At my restaurant, I serve the neck as part of ``an epigram of lamb,'' a dish that uses many parts: the neck and shoulder are boned, stuffed, and braised; the rack and saddle are marinated and roasted; and the leg is studded with garlic and herbs, and given a long, juicy roast. This time, I decided to create a special dish for this underappreciated cut.    In the best of all possible worlds, you would have your butcher reserve a whole neck, which is about a foot long and looks a little like an oxtail. He would bone and butterfly it so that you could stuff it with savory ground pork, roll and tie it, and then braise it.    But necks can be hard to come by. If you can't get one, use a boned and butterflied shoulder. (You can also skip the stuffing and just braise lamb shanks.)    To get the most from the neck, which is a relatively tough cut, I brown the meat first and then braise it slowly in white wine with a lot of carrots, Texas onions, and fresh fennel.    By the time the lamb emerges from the oven, the vegetables, nourished by the cooking juices, have softened and sweetened, in the style of the classic beef dish, boeuf aux carottes.    And like so many rustic dishes, this one proves what good cooks have always known: The poorest cuts can produce the richest flavors. You've just got to treat them right.    BRAISED LAMB NECK WITH SPRING CARROTS, ONIONS, AND FENNEL    Time: about 3 hours    \ cup olive oil    1 medium onion, finely diced    3 large white mushrooms, cut into \-inch dice    Salt and freshly ground black pepper    6 cloves garlic, peeled    2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh thyme leaves    1 slice stale or oven-dried crustless white bread, cut into \-inch dice    1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh parsley leaves    2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh basil leaves    { pound ground pork    1 whole lamb neck, about 10 to 12 inches long, bone removed lengthwise, meat deveined and butterflied, so that it lays flat and is { inch thick (or 1 lamb shoulder, cut in the same manner)    4 tablespoons unsalted butter    12 medium carrots (preferably California), peeled and cut diagonally into {-inch slices    6 Texas or Vidalia onions, trimmed and cut in half from root to top    1 fennel bulb, trimmed and cut into {-inch wedges    1 bottle dry white wine, preferably chardonnay.    1. In medium saute pan over medium heat, heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil. Add onion, and cook, stirring, until it is translucent, about 4 minutes. Add mushrooms, and salt and pepper to taste. Saute until mushrooms are just tender. Finely chop 1 clove garlic. Add it to pan with half of the chopped thyme; saute 2 minutes. Stir in bread cubes and parsley; saute 1 minute. Remove pan from heat, and allow to cool. Add chopped basil, ground pork, and salt and pepper to taste. Knead mixture by hand to blend well, and set aside in a cool place.    2. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Place lamb on work surface, and season with salt and pepper. Spoon stuffing down center of meat, forming cylinder. Roll meat firmly around stuffing, shaping it into a roast. Tie roast with kitchen string at 1-inch intervals, to secure stuffing.    3. Place large deep roasting pan over medium-high heat, and add remaining olive oil. Slip lamb into pan, and sear it, turning frequently, until well browned all over. Add 2 tablespoons of the butter, and baste lamb with combined pan fats. Roast lamb in oven for 15 minutes, basting regularly. G

Piles of crunchy, colorful vegetables paired with savory bits of marinated meat or fish can be just the thing to brighten a tired culinary routine and segue into the salad days of summer.    The wok was part of Chinese cooking for 3,000 years before it managed to show up as something ``new'' in American kitchens just a few decades ago.    Many Americans recognized stir-frying and the wok as an ideal way to deliver fast, low-fat, economical and tasty meals and embraced it as a regular part of their at-home menus.

But using a wok adds greatly to the esthetics of the process, and it comes down to being just plain fun. There is, however, some basic information you need to know for successfully using a wok and stir-frying.

Pot roast should be the epitome of a minimalist meal. Since the meat has to be braised until almost falling apart, timing is flexible. Since it is cooked in a covered pot with liquid, it never dries out, whether you cook it on top of the stove or in the oven, at low or high heat. You can serve pot roast as soon as it is finished or cook it in advance and reheat it. In any case, the cooking turns a tough cut of beef tender for a one-pot supper.    The usual pot roast has roots in France or Britain and so is cooked with onions, garlic, mushrooms and red wine or stock. There is no tradition of Asian pot roasts, since a scarcity of fuel in east Asia precluded long, slow cooking. But if you substitute soy sauce and water for red wine or stock, and ginger and star anise for onions and mushrooms, the meat takes on Asian flavors.    And pot roast really is pretty effortless, especially if you skip browning the meat. Browning does create complexity, but there is so much flavor in this Asian dish that it is not so important. Once everything is in the pot, your only job will be to turn the meat occasionally, if you like, and to make sure the liquid in the pot does not evaporate. Keep the heat fairly low, so that the liquid does not boil away quickly.    The one tricky part of pot roast is choosing the beef. Tender cuts, like sirloin and tenderloin, will cook much quicker but will not develop the same rich, silky sauce as the tougher cuts do. It is the tough connective tissue, combined with the seasoned braising liquid, that makes the sauce great. Inexpensive cuts like chuck or brisket are best. Chuck turns tender a little faster, but it is fattier and you will never be able to cut nice, even slices from the roast. Brisket becomes a little drier, but the sauce takes care of that, and it slices beautifully.    Many new recipes for Asian-flavored pot roast advise seasoning or marinating the meat overnight, but because the star anise, ginger and soy sauce are so strong you can easily dispense with that step.    The vegetables added to the pot at the start of cooking, whether ginger or garlic, contribute to the sauce's development, but those at the end, like the rutabagas and turnips, draw on the sauce for flavor, often making them the best part.    &UR; ASIAN POT ROAST &LR;    &UR; Time: 3 to 4 hours &LR;    1 tablespoon peanut or vegetable oil    1 3- to 4-pound piece of brisket or boneless chuck    one-third cup dark soy sauce (or { cup light soy sauce)    5 nickel-size slices ginger (peeling is not necessary)    4 star anise    2 to 3 cups peeled and cubed rutabaga or white turnip    { cup trimmed and minced scallions.    1. Place oil in a large skillet, and turn heat to high. A minute later, add meat, cover the pan loosely to reduce spattering and sear about five minutes on each side, or until nicely browned. Meanwhile, combine soy, ginger, star anise and 2 cups of water in a casserole big enough to fit the meat snugly. Bring to a boil, then lower to a simmer.    2. When the meat is browned, add it to casserole and cover. Cook, turning meat once or twice an hour and adding more water if necessary, for about 3 hours, or until meat is just about tender _ or until a thin-bladed knife inserted into the meat meets little resistance. Fish out star anise, and add rutabaga or turnip, stirring to make sure it is coated with liquid (again, add more water if necessary).

JOSEF HEBERT, Associated Press Writer    WASHINGTON (AP) -- Fish and other marine life are being killed and marshlands damaged in more than a third of the nation's coastal areas from algae blooms caused by the runoff of excess nutrients, the National Academy of Sciences said Tuesday.    The scientists concluded that the problem of coastal pollution from nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers is so severe and widespread that states require federal help. The nutrients often travel hundreds of miles along rivers before they create problems.    ''Conditions in many coastal areas are expected to worsen unless action is taken now to reduce nutrient pollution,'' said Robert Howarth, a professor of ecology and environmental biology at Cornell University, and the panel's chairman.    While nitrogen and phosphorous occur in nature and are critical to support plant life in marine environments, too much of the nutrients causes an excessive growth of phytoplankton and other organisms, which deprive fish and other marine life, including plants, of oxygen. That causes marine life to die or be driven away.    Algae blooms caused by an overabundance of nutrients -- specifically, excessive nitrogen from agricultural fertilizers or poultry waste -- have been linked to a decline of fisheries, the death of manatees along the Florida coast, and the loss of coral reefs and sea grasses, the panel said.    Algae blooms have been blamed for years for the so-called dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico along the Louisiana and Texas coast. Large amounts of nutrients flowing from the Farm Belt into and down the Mississippi River have caused the massive dead zone -- the size of New Jersey -- each spring in the Gulf of Mexico. Scientists estimated the amount of nitrogen pouring from the river into the Gulf has tripled, and the amount of phosphorous doubled, in the past 40 years.    Algae blooms also have been linked to a microbial called pfiesteria that has killed fish in tributaries of the Chesapeake Bay and off the Carolinas.    But the report by the Academy's National Research Council said that nitrogen and phosphorous pollution is causing environmental damage along almost all of the nation's estuaries, with severe problems identified in 44 of the 139 coastal areas examined.    ''Excess nitrogen in our coastal waters starts a dangerous chain of ecological events that is exacerbating harmful algae blooms such as red tides, contaminating shellfish, killing coastal wildlife, reducing biodiversity, destroying sea grass, and contributing to a host of other environmental problems,'' warned Howarth.    Because rivers often transport chemical nutrients hundreds of miles from inland farmland and urban centers, the most severe problem areas, according to the report, are where rivers and bays feed water into the ocean.    Severe problem areas, where there were symptoms of low oxygen levels, toxic algae blooms and loss of submerged aquatic vegetation, were found along the coasts of nine states: Washington, California, Louisiana, Texas, Florida, North Carolina, Maryland, New York, and Massachusetts.    The most severe problems were reported in the mid-Atlantic states and the Gulf of Mexico, the report said.    Worldwide, human activity -- from excessive use of fertilizers to the burning of fossil fuels -- have caused the amount of nitrogen in the environment to more than double since the 1960s. The wide use of synthetic fertilizers account for much of the growth, but other sources are animal waste, including chicken and hog manure, discharges from wastewater treatment plants, and the burning of fossil fuels.    Nitrogen compounds in the air, usually from smokestacks, also contribute to the high nutrient levels in some estuaries, especially along the East Coast, the panel said. It estimated that tougher pollution controls on soot being imposed by the Environmental Protection Agency could cut such water deposits by as much as 17 percent.    There are no federal l

The prediction by Thawatchai Sophasatienpong, deputy director-general of the Commerce Ministry's Business Economics Department, is based on a 0.2 percent decline in the consumer price index (CPI) between September and October, The Bangkok Post reported Tuesday. The department expects a similar decline in November and a further drop in December, as long as there are no unexpected problems such as floods. The October inflation was 5.9 percent higher than in the same month of last year. The December price increase is expected to be 4.8 percent year-on-year, compared with 8 percent forecast by the IMF. The fall in October continued the trend in September, with foods including rice, eggs, vegetables and fruit down in price. The food and beverage index was down by 0.7 percent between September and October, while the index for other products was up by 0.2 percent. Products to fall in price last month included fragrant jasmine rice, pork, cabbages, chilies, orange, eggs and cleaning products. Prices were unchanged for cooking gas, telecommunications and electricity services, public transport and clothes. However, marine equipment, fuel oil, ferry boat services and cement rose in price. Thawatchai said declining interest rates and inflation would spur domestic consumption and economic growth.

But if you didn't make it yourself and tote it to the office, a good bowl of soup can be hard to find. Many restaurants rely on commercial soup bases, and even homestyle mom-and-pop restaurants dump bags of frozen vegetables in the pot. And once made, the soup can sit in heated pots, thickening to a sludge as the hours drag by.    None of this is the makings of good soup.    But at Chin's Oriental Restaurant indowntown Dayton, owner Art Chin is a believer in scratch soups. He makes his own stock, starting with the bones left from deboning chicken for entrees.    At DiSalvo's Deli and Italian store in Kettering, Rinaldo DiSalvo starts making tomorrow's soup today. It is a six-hour process that begins with bones _ maybe pork bones from the meat he's boned to make his sausage or maybe chicken or beef bones.    And at Flavors in Englewood, Elaine Alex-Lorusso and her husband, Rich, make a different soup every day, choosing from a repertoire of 45. The variety ranges from a portobello with red onion in a clear broth, which she describes as ``way beyond popular,'' to a thick black bean soup with sliced turkey.    ``In the morning we come in and prep for another soup,'' she says. They, too, make their own stock, a necessity because many of their customers are vegetarian.    While Chin's featured soup changes with the season, ``salmon soup is the signature for our fusion cooking,'' says Chin, and it is brought back annually in fall and winter.    Other rotating soups that Chin calls light entrees are a ramen noodle soup with strip steak and a soba noodle soup made with Japanese dashi and sliced marinated chicken and vegetables, plus a duck soup. For that one, Chin browns the bones, carrots, onion and jalapeno peppers to make the stock. The duck meat is marinated, seared and slivered and added to the soup with shredded vegetables.    Chin always has three traditional soups on the line: hot and sour, wonton and egg drop, but makes some soups to order. Those quick soups include the house-made broth, with additions of either cooked rice or noodles, and some chicken and steamed vegetables to go on top.    One of the best may be a soup of fresh tofu and Asian greens dropped into the boiling stock, and Chin says they willingly make a vegetarian version starting with water, a little soy, some ginger, plus a touch of garlic, salt and pepper.    ``It makes a pretty good vegetarian broth,'' he says.    At DiSalvo's, the soup of the day depends on the owner's whim.    ``I gotta do something different. I can't do the same thing all the time,'' he says. He's working on an asparagus soup to introduce in the spring.    Usually DiSalvo roasts meaty bones before adding them to a stockpot of water. But he changes his methods to suit his whims, so for his lentil soup last week he skipped the browning process and just added the unroasted bones to the water along with some leeks. That was at 8 a.m., and he didn't turn off the burner until 2 p.m. By then the lentils had thickened to a puree. The soup needed only to be cooled and refrigerated for the next day.    DiSalvo's soups never go back into a soup pot or steam table.    ``I can't stand soup on a steam table all day. It ruins the soup,'' he says. So he heats each bowl of soup to order. ``People have to wait for soup here, but it's fresh.''    The lineup, with no scheduled rotation, includes an Italian wedding soup, full of chunks of chicken as well as Romano-flavored chicken meatballs and pastina. While that's the deli's most-requested soup, DiSalvo prefers making bean soup _ escarole and white beans, black bean soup, split pea soup, pasta fagioli and minestrone.    As at Flavors, customers just have to call to find out what's fresh.    Here are scratch soup recipes from the three businesses.

On Saturday scuffles broke out between farmers and seamen near the mooring of the Knossos ferry boat in Iraklion, the major port of the Island. Government officials and leaders of the Seamens Federation of Greece (PNO) are holding meetings at the Merchant Marine Ministry in an effort to reach a compromise regarding the farmers' plight who stand to lose millions of drachmas if their highly perishable produce is not shipped to Greek and European markets on time. In order to reduce the losses of the farmers, C-130 military transport aircraft were employed to pick up perishables. It has also been reported that navy landing vessels were expected at other Cretan ports to pick up trucks carrying fruit and vegetables. The PNO decided late Thursday night to extend a four-day strike for another four days until early Tuesday morning. The strike affects Greek-flag vessels of all categories as well as foreign ships employing Greek seamen. A local court on Friday ruled the extension of an ongoing semen's strike was illegal and an abuse of their right to strike. The court, acting on a suit filed by shipowners, ruled that if seamen do not call off their strike action within the day, the 14 trade unionists comprising the PNO administration would be sentenced to two months' detainment and a 100,000 drachma (410 U.S. dollars) fine for each violation of the court ruling. The seamen are pressing demands for increased insurance and unemployment benefits, an increase in minimum pensions and preservation of tax breaks enjoyed since 1955.

They hang humbly in their little mesh sacks in probably every kitchen on earth, and nobody ever pays them much attention or ever considers where we would be without them. Yet the lack of an onion at a crucial time can send you out to hunt one up more quickly than just about anything, so necessary are they to our palates. The pale, unassuming onion: always in the background, perpetually playing a supporting role, allowing flashier foods to shine and dazzle.    Onions weren't always taken so much for granted. When the world was younger and people had a lot less to distract them, folks flat-out marveled at the onion, which was one of the first vegetables that humans cultivated for food after it emerged from the primordial ooze. With its translucent layers and spheres within spheres, the onion took on religious significance. The Egyptians believed them nothing less than a symbol of eternity and took their sacred oaths on onions.    The Byzantine domes that are part of the architecture of religious structures the world over? Onions.    Their value became more secular during the Middle Ages, when you could pay off your debts with a sack of onions. During the Civil War, Gen. Ulysses S. Grant informed the War Department, ``I will not move my army without onions.'' Three trainloads were delivered to the front the next day.    Civilization has long since stopped marveling at onions, but once a year we do get a chance to give them a bit of well-deserved attention. This is onion season, when growers in places such as Washington state, Idaho, Oregon, Hawaii, South Texas and, of course, South Georgia begin tooting their horns about their crop and everyone becomes a little more aware of the humble bulb.    Now's a good time to renew our appreciation for the onion, and about 10 minutes on the Internet allows you to pay proper homage.    &QR;  To hold your own in any conversation about onions, see www.bpe.com/food/columns    /ferrayfiszer/onions.htm for a good, readable overview of the different types, where they are grown, what makes them sweet or not, why they make you cry and a little history.    &QR;  Another very well-done site is maintained by the National Onion Association. Go to www    .onions-usa.org/ for health and nutritional information, trivia, trends and some great recipes.    &QR;  With all the emphasis on the ancient religious significance of onions, we forgot to mention that they were once considered a powerful aphrodisiac. Roman writer Martial advised, ``If your wife is old and you're . . . exhausted, eat onions in plenty.'' To see how onions played a part in the romantic lives of the Arabs, Greeks, Romans and Hindus, drop in at www.santesson.com/aphrodis/onion    .htm for an interesting visit.    &QR;  And then there are onion laws _ lots of 'em. Head for aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu    /plantanswers/publications/onions    /ONIONLAWS.html and learn that:    &QR;  In Northfield, Conn., local residents are prohibited from eating raw onions while walking down a street.    &QR;  Barbers in Columbia, Pa., are prohibited from eating onions between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m.    &QR;  In Dyersburg, Tenn., residents aren't allowed to enter a movie theater within four hours after having eaten raw onions.    &QR;  And gentlemen in Headland, Ala., need to be aware that ``No man can place his arm around or kiss an unchaperoned woman without a good and lawful reason, should he have eaten onions within the last four hours.''

If you're older than 20, you should have it checked periodically, especially if you have heart disease in your family. If you're in your 40s or 50s, you're way behind schedule if you haven't had it checked recently. All it takes is a quick blood test.    If your numbers are low, you know you're doing something right; if they're high, you and your physician can take action.    High cholesterol is one of the major risk factors for heart disease, although it's far from the only one. Much of the treatment for high cholesterol is simple _ eating in a healthy way and exercising.    Many people know they have high or borderline-high cholesterol and aren't doing anything about it. They figure they feel fine, and they lost that pamphlet their doctor or nurse gave them at their last appointment. If you're one of those people, this guide is for you, or anyone else you know who's at risk for heart disease.    WHAT IS A HEALTHY LEVEL?    Cholesterol is measured in milligrams per deciliter of blood (mg/dL). Knowing your total blood cholesterol level is important in determining your risk for heart disease. If you have high cholesterol, you're not alone. Nearly 97 million Americans have levels that are borderline-high or high. Cholesterol levels are graded on this scale:    Less than 200 mg/dL is desirable    200 to 239 mg/dL is borderline-high    240 mg/dL and up is high    WHO SHOULD HAVE THEIR HIS OR HER CHOLESTEROL TESTED?    In general, adults who are older than 20 should have their cholesterol levels tested every five years, according to the American Heart Association. You may need to be tested more frequently depending on your health history and family history.    WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ``GOOD'' AND ``BAD'' CHOLESTEROL?    The ``good'' cholesterol is HDL-C, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. HDL-C is thought to aid in the removal of excess cholesterol from the blood. High levels of HDL-C are associated with a decreased risk of heart attack. Your HDL-C level should be 35 mg/dL or higher.    ``Bad'' cholesterol is LDL-C, or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Too much LDL-C in your blood can stick to the walls of your arteries, narrowing them and reducing their ability to transport blood. In people without heart disease, the LDL-C level should be lower than 130 mg/dL.    Here's an easy way to remember the difference. L stands for life-threatening or LDL cholesterol, and H stands for healthy or HDL-C. Ask what your levels of each one are.    HOW CAN I LOWER MY CHOLESTEROL?    The American Heart Association's most important piece of advice is: Watch what you eat. To help lower your cholesterol, eat five or more servings of fruits and vegetables each day. Eat a wide variety of foods low in saturated fat and cholesterol.    You also should exercise. Aerobic activities such as dancing, brisk walking, jogging, biking or swimming will help. Activity that increases your heart rate for 30 or 60 minutes or longer each day is best. On busy days, remember that even 10 or 15 minutes of physical activity is better than none.    FOODS LOW IN SATURATED FAT AND CHOLESTEROL    Lean cuts of red meat, chicken or turkey, roasted or baked with the skin removed, fresh or canned fruits and vegetables, whole grains, beans, pasta, breads, potatoes, hot and cold cereal, taco shells and plain tortillas, olive oil, corn oil, canola oil, baked or broiled fish, skim milk, low-fat or nonfat yogurt, low-fat or part-skim cheese, angel food cake, fig bar cookies, gingersnaps, animal crackers, jelly beans, hard candy, popsicles and frozen yogurt.

Anchor the veggies in florist clay in a container, or make a bridesmaid-style bouquet of baby artichokes, asparagus, yellow wax beans, radishes, sprouts, parsley and anything else that strikes your fancy from the produce counters. Fill in with Queen Anne's Lace. For backing, use a frill of lace or a doily.    Think about vegetables for cooking, too. The favorite hallmarks of spring _ artichokes and asparagus _ are joined this year by several new arrivals, including broccolini, broccoli sprouts and green gourmet garlic. These new vegetables will inspire culinary adventures.    Many of the newcomers have a high nutrition profile and make it easy to get the five servings a day that nutrition experts would have us eat to reduce the risk of cancer and heart disease and promote optimum health.    Broccolini    Broccolini is a cross between broccoli and Chinese kale. Despite its Italian-sounding name, it was developed in Japan. It is green with long, slender stalks like kale; the small head of buds at the top is smaller than broccoli. It was created by Sakata Seed Co. in Yokohama, Japan, which christened it Asparation for its asparagus-like stalks.    Sakata was trying to expand its market for broccoli seed because broccoli requires a cool growing atmosphere. That limits it to certain times of year and certain locations. It took seven years to develop the hybrid, which is smaller and more tender than broccoli, especially the stalk. Tasters found broccolini more elegant than broccoli. They liked its size and appearance and the fact that the whole plant is edible.    A California company, Sanbon, also calls broccolini Asparation. It is much more expensive than broccoli. It is sold at Kroger Signature stores for $1.69 a bunch (about 8 ounces).    Broccoli sprouts    Broccoli sprouts have 30 to 50 times the concentration of protective chemicals compared to mature broccoli. A diet rich in broccoli (and other cruciferous vegetables such as cabbage and cauliflower) is associated with a lower risk of cancer. To halve the odds of colon cancer, you would have to eat about 2 pounds of cooked broccoli a week. With broccoli sprouts, 1 ounce a week provides the same protection as 1 1/4 pounds of broccoli.    This may be good news to those who don't like broccoli, because the sprouts, which are tender shoots about 2 inches tall, don't taste like the stronger-flavored mature vegetable.    They also contain phytochemicals, a new buzz word in nutrition circles. Scientists believe that phytochemicals may be one reason a diet rich in fruits and vegetables can reduce the risk of disease.    Broccoli sprouts are grown from special seeds, adding only water and light. They contain antioxidants, which help destroy harmful free radicals in the body. The sprouts were developed by scientists at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and are marketed as Fresh Alternatives BroccoSprouts. They were introduced at Kroger Signature stores in February.    Broccoli sprouts can be used like other sprouts in salads, on sandwiches or as garnishes.    Green gourmet garlic    A stalk of green gourmet garlic looks like a smaller version of a green onion with a garlic bulb on the end instead of an onion.    Dilip Naik of Sugar Land, Texas, grew up in Surat in the state of Gujarat on the west coast of India, where green gourmet garlic is a staple in the cuisine. Naik missed it when he moved to Houston to work as an engineer.    He realized the climate here is similar to Surat's and began to grow some of the baby garlic plants for his own use. Recently he acquired a partner, Jim Butaud of Kirbyville, who is helping expand the business into a commercial venture. They have set up greenhouses north of Beaumont, Texas. Naik's Gourmet Country Farm is in Sugar Land.    Green gourmet garlic never touches dirt; it is grown in water in environmentally controlled greenhouses. Although it is grown from regular garlic cloves, it ha

The Aleppo pepper is more seductive, exuding a mellow, earthy warmth that seems to expand rapidly, then slowly dissipate.    When sprinkled over roasted potatoes, the deep red waxy flakes of the Aleppo, a pepper that comes from Syria, do not just add flavor; they change the potatoes. Behind their pure nutty flavor, there is smokiness and a little spice. With carrots, the pepper underlines the vegetable's sweetness with its own raisin-like taste _ and that lingering heat. It is like paprika, but much more complex.    Aleppo refers to red peppers in the capsicum family that are grown, partly dried and coarsely ground around the city of Aleppo. Other peppers from nearby regions look the same, but the Aleppo flavor is distinct, just as the flavor of prosciutto di Parma is distinct from other cured pork.    As alluring as it is, Aleppo pepper has managed to elude most chefs and home cooks. Restaurants serving Syrian and other Middle Eastern food, like Zaytoons in Brooklyn, Moustache in Greenwich Village and Layla in TriBeCa, do not even use it.    And yet, the chefs who have discovered it can't seem to put it down. Floyd Cardoz of Tabla uses Aleppo pepper in a number of dishes, often blended with cayenne and chilies from India and New Mexico. Its mild, rich heat is in the pan-roasted lobster glazed with Goan curry and in the tomato curry sauce served with a raviolo of spinach and sheep's milk ricotta. It even finds a place in a warm Cheddar fondue with cumin.    Joyce Goldstein, a San Francisco chef who has written cookbooks, is another devotee of Aleppo pepper, and like Cardoz, she is not a purist about it. She often simply uses it in place of other dried red peppers for a richer, smokier aroma.    ``Anytime you have the choice of using hot paprika or a paprika-cayenne combination, that's the time to use it,'' she said.    Aleppo pepper is sold in most good spice shops, like Adriana's Bazaar at Grand Central Market, (800) 316-0820, and Kalustyans, 123 Lexington Avenue, (212) 685-3416. It is also sold online at www.worldspice.com. The price is usually around $2 an ounce.    A similar pepper called Maras comes from just over the border in Turkey. It looks the same as the Aleppo _ bright red, flaked and moist from a small addition of salt _ but is a tad hotter. Urfa, also from Turkey, is darker and smokier, with a deeper, dried-fruit aroma. Sometimes these peppers are not even packaged with specific names. Maras and Aleppo may simply be labeled Middle Eastern pepper.    Aleppo is used in a spread called muhammara, in which the coarse powder is diluted in oil and water, then mixed with bread crumbs, ground walnuts, lemon juice and pomegranate syrup, and eaten like hummus, with flatbread. It is also used to season meat fillings, legumes and salads.    But you can use it like any other dried red pepper. It can be sprinkled over sweet potatoes with a little coarse sea salt and olive oil before roasting them. Aleppo blends well with other spices, too, like toasted and ground cumin and coriander for coating pieces of carrot before roasting or braising. The light, thin flakes cling well to vegetables, fish and meats and work well with other spices as rubs or in marinades.    Aleppo's sweetness and soft heat is especially good with sweet vegetables like tomatoes and eggplant. One way to see this is to char eggplants and puree them while warm with garlic, olive oil and lemon juice, adding a touch of Aleppo at the end. The pepper underscores the smokiness of the eggplant.    As Cardoz points out, Aleppo has one quality that few other dried red peppers have: you can add it to a finished dish and not worry about the sharpness overwhelming it. ``If you add almost any other chili pepper at the end of cooking, it hits you in the throat,'' he said.    Aleppo has a roasted, finished flavor, so you can simmer white beans with onion, garlic and herbs, then

Potato ricers create fluffy, lump-free mashed potatoes and retail for around $20.    Food mills are much more versatile; they work as a masher, strainer, blender and ricer _ but they can be expensive. Home Chef's most popular food mill retails for $85 and comes with exchangeable disks for additional versatility. Prices range from $30-$100.    &UR; Nonstick baking sheet liners.  &LR; Ets-Hokin says these are a great gift choice for bakers. The silicon-coated liners allow cookies and candies to easily slide off and are making a move from the professional to home kitchen.

The liners come in two sizes and retail for around $26.    &UR; The Instant-Marinator.  &LR; Vacuvin makes this piece of equipment that reduces the time it takes to marinate meat from one hour to 17 seconds. The meat is placed in a pouch with the marinade &UR;  &LR; and the device removes the air, causing the pores to open. &UR;  &LR; After 17 seconds, the air is let back into the pouch. The pores close, holding flavor inside. The Instant-Marinator retails for $29.    &UR; A gravy/stock strainer.  &LR; These measuring cups, with a long pouring spout coming off the bottom, are not new but are remarkably useful to get rid of fat in stock and pan drippings. Since fat rises to the top, when liquids are poured out of the cup through the bottom spout, the fat remains and can be discarded. The strainer retails around $15.    &UR; OXO Good Grips turkey lifter.  &LR; This gadget eases the chore of getting the heavy holiday bird out of the pan. Slip the hook into the turkey cavity and pull. It retails for about $10.    &UR; Camerons Smoker. &LR;  No need to wait for summer barbecue season if you enjoy smoked foods. This smoker is designed to be used indoors. It sits on any stovetop and imparts smoke flavor into meat, poultry, fish or vegetables as they cook. It retails for around $60.    &UR; Popeil Showtime Rotissierie and Grill ($179.99) and George &LR;   &UR; Forman Grill ($99.95).  &LR; Both are ``as seen on TV'' items, bringing outdoor cooking into the kitchen. The table-top rotissiere is large enough to hold two chickens. The Foreman ``lean, mean grilling machine'' is an electric grilling pan that allows fat to run off into a tray.

But you don't have to have a lavish setting or a fancy grill to enjoy wonderful succulent foods cooked outdoors. A simple charcoal or gas grill _ or even a hibachi _ will do.    Grilling is still the all-American pastime. Seventy-five percent of U.S. households own and use a barbecue grill _ and more than 60 percent of gas grill owners cook out several times a week year-round, according to the Barbecue Industry Association.    ``Grilling is so easy and tasty, it's no wonder it is one of America's favorite outdoor pastimes,'' says Kristi Fuller, editor of ``Better Homes and Gardens The New Grilling Book'' (Meredith Books; $29.95). The down-to-earth volume covers all the basics _ including information on regional preferences, starting a fire, heat control, timing tips, food safety, grilling gadgets and how to select a grill. You'll also find a grilling glossary along with grilling charts and tips sprinkled throughout the 372 pages, which feature more than 500 recipes.    Taste was the primary focus, although simplicity and ease of preparation _ along with straightforward ingredients readily available in supermarkets _ were also considerations in recipes, Fuller says. All include prep and cooking times, as well as nutritional information.    Recipes run the gamut from condiments, appetizers, sides and desserts to beef, veal, lamb, pork, chicken, turkey, fish, shellfish, game and fowl. A separate chapter covers smoke cooking with recipes like Pecan-Smoked Pork Chops, Texas Beer-Smoked Ribs and Double-Smoked Salmon With Horseradish Cream.    When it comes to smoke cooking, Fuller favors an electric smoker because it's the most reliable. However, she suggests getting acquainted with the smoking process on a simple scale by using a charcoal or gas grill before investing in other equipment such as a vertical water smoker or a horizontal dry smoker.    Cooking on gas or charcoal grills is done by one of two cooking methods _ direct or indirect heat. Direct grilling _ where foods are placed directly over the heat source (and should be turned halfway through the cooking time) _ is similar to broiling and best-suited to foods that are tender, small or thin and cook quickly in less than 25 minutes. That includes burgers, steaks, kabobs, chops, hot dogs, boneless poultry, fish and most vegetables.    Direct grilling can be done with the lid up or down, but when the cover is closed, the grill begins to simulate an oven. You can cook larger items such as roasts or bone-in poultry more slowly this way and impart a smoky flavor.    When food is cooked by indirect heat, it is placed adjacent to, rather than directly over the coals _ and the cover is down. This method is used for large cuts of meat, ribs, whole fish and birds, and other foods that require longer, slower cooking.    When starting a charcoal grill, figure on mounding and igniting about 30 briquettes per pound of meat to be cooked with the lid up. Since it'll take about 20 to 30 minutes for the coals to turn ash gray, start the grill 30 minutes before you're planning to grill the food. Begin preheating a gas grill 10 to 15 minutes prior to cooking.    A key to successful grilling is determining the point when the charcoal or gas will have attained the ideal temperature for cooking the food.    ``Too-high heat can char and dry out the food, while too-low can defeat the quick-cooking benefit of grilling,'' says Fuller.    You can judge the approximate temperature of the coals by how long you can hold your hand above the coals at the cooking level (of the food). If you can hold your hand comfortably over the coals for only two seconds, figure that the fire is hot and the temperature will be around 400 to 450 degrees F. Coals should appear barely covered with gray ash and be burning when done. A medium fire e

For example, we ``know'' these truisms:    _ Dried beans must be soaked overnight before cooking.    _ Meat shouldn't be salted before cooking or it will lose too much moisture.    _ Pork roast must be cooked to 170 degrees for flavor and safety.    In our new ``Best Way'' column starting today, the Food staff will systematically challenge many of these truisms and techniques that our mothers, friends and cookbook authors have told us were true.    Cooking has changed, but our assumptions often haven't. We have better ovens that bake with more even heat. The freshness and quality of produce and meats have improved. We can buy more varieties of meats and vegetables that benefit from different cooking techniques. Plus we have less time to experiment in the kitchen to find out what works and what doesn't.    In ``Best Way,'' the Food staff will examine preparation presumptions and try to establish the most reliable way to cook many of our favorite foods.    Today we tackle the ultimate comfort food _ baked potatoes. After testing, tasting and retesting we tried 16 variations before coming up with the winner.    We also developed a citrus marinade for chicken and pork to determine the optimum time the meat should marinate and whether the marinade should contain salt. You may be surprised at the results.    In coming weeks we'll examine the dried bean question. We'll share our findings on producing the creamiest, fluffiest scrambled eggs; and we'll even tackle the best way to brew coffee.    If you have a cooking question or a subject you'd like us to investigate, we'd love to hear from you. We'll answer as many questions as we can in print.

We discovered that even slight changes in the cooking method and temperature could make big differences in the final product.    In a three-step process, we cooked medium-sized russet potatoes 14 ways, testing oven temperature, cooking time and cooking style. We wrapped, oiled, buttered, salted _ and left some completely plain. We even tried the microwave.    In our series of taste tests, the Food staff agreed potatoes are best when cooked in a 350-degree oven for 11/2 hours. Potatoes baked at higher temperatures for less time had limp skins and dense flesh.    The most varied results, however, came from slight changes in the cooking method.    The potatoes cooked in foil were a disaster _ they tasted more steamed than baked. The skin was limp and chewy, the flesh dense and overly-moist.    Rubbing the potato with oil produced a similar steamed effect, but the flavor was better.    And when microwaved, the potato turned into a shriveled, mushy mess.    &QL;   &UR; THE BEST WAY &LR;    The plain potato, pierced with a fork to let steam escape, produced the best results. Baked at 350 degrees for 11/2 hours, the potato emerged with a great flavor and a light and fluffy texture. In addition, the skin was crisp but chewable.    &QL;   &UR; AN APPEALING ALTERNATIVE &LR;    If you want a change from the pure baked potato experience, the potato rubbed with olive oil and coarse salt is a good choice. The skin absorbs the flavor of the oil and the flecks of salt give it added visual interest.    Surprisingly, the Food staff found that the potato rubbed with butter wasn't as good as the one with oil. It was fluffier inside, but the cooked butter flavor didn't improve the outside.    &LR;  &QL;   &UR; FOR THE HURRIED COOK &LR;    In a time crunch, you can microwave a potato for 5 minutes, then finish it in a 350-degree oven for 10 minutes.

JOSEF HEBERT, Associated Press Writer    WASHINGTON (AP) -- An isolated speck in the center of the Pacific Ocean, the Palmyra Atoll, a pristine network of 52 small islands is being purchased by a conservation group to guarantee the preservation of its pristine marine wilderness.    The Nature Conservancy will announce Thursday that it is buying the uninhabited islands -- 680 acres of land in all -- and adjacent coral reefs and lagoons, from the Fullard-Leo family in Hawaii.    The price was not disclosed, but is said to be in the range of $30 million.    Although privately owned, the atoll is considered a territory of the United States and under the civil jurisdiction of the Interior Department. The Nature Conservancy hopes that two-thirds of the atoll eventually will be administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as a wildlife refuge.    Calling it a ''jewel of America's Pacific coral reefs,'' Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt said the atoll -- just north of the equator and 1,052 miles south of Honolulu -- ''should be protected from exploitation'' and preserved for future generations to see.    The island's colorful history dates back more than two centuries and includes everything from buried pirates' treasure and talk of an island curse to a battle before the U.S. Supreme Court over ownership. It played a key part in a murder mystery that eventually produced a best seller and a made-for-television movie. And while now seen as an ideal place for ecological research, in the 1970s it almost became a placed to dump nuclear waste.    Folklore has it that in 1816 a Spanish pirate ship, full of Inca treasures, wrecked on the Palmyra reefs and its crew supposedly buried the loot under a palm tree. But treasure hunting is only one of the potential threats to the island's plush, tropical foliage, pristine coral treasures and crystal clear lagoons.    ''There have been a range of threats over time'' prompting the Nature Conservancy's interest in buying the atoll, says Nancy Mackinnon, who has been working on the Palmyra project for the conservation group since 1997.    In the 1970s, the Energy Department saw Palmyra as a place to dump nuclear waste, only to abandon the idea. Private entrepreneurs more recently wanted it for chemical and nuclear waste storage. Other buyers have had plans to build a hotel and casino and even a retreat for senior citizens.    During World War II, Palmyra was a U.S. Navy waypoint for airplanes crossing the Pacific. A 6,000-foot runway and other buildings were built, but they are now dilapidated and overgrown by jungle. No one lives on the islands today.    Mackinnon says the island's rich ecological treasures will provide a paradise for research and ecotourism. ''But only in small groups,'' she adds quickly.    The islands, which receive 175 inches of rain a year, are covered by lush tropical vegetation that provides a place for an estimated million nesting seabirds. Countless birds rely on the islands as a resting place as they migrate -- some from as far away as Alaska to the South Pacific.    The atoll's reefs have three to five times the number of coral species found in Hawaii or the Florida Keys. Black-tip and tiger sharks abound in its waters and other marine species include pilot whales, bottlenosed dolphins, hawksbill turtles, giant clams and the coconut crab, the world's largest land-based invertebrate that cracks open coconuts with its claws.    Some old salts have suggested the atoll is cursed because of tales of mariners who have landed there and later fell upon misfortune.    In 1974, a San Diego, Calif., couple were murdered aboard their expensive yacht by another couple they had befriended, and their bodies were dumped in waters near Palmyra. The woman's skeletal remains were found six year later after they had washed ashore. The double murder later became a best selling book, ''And The Sea Will Tell'', and a made-for-television movie.

I obey the rules and catch enough to feed my family and friends. I'm not political, but if anybody gets in the way of my fishing, they're going to hear from me.''    Papoulidis is one of 5 million recreational and 16,000 commercial fishermen in Florida, all demanding a fair share of the ocean's resources. To guarantee a future for fisheries however, many scientists say as much as 40 percent of the world's marine ecosystems need protection. That means closing or restricting many traditional fishing areas and creating what are becoming known globally as Marine Protected Areas.    The National Research Council, an independent arm of the National Academy of Science, is in the middle of a government-financed, two-year study of the protected areas. The council's committee of 21 international experts is conducting a series of five public forums around the United States coastlines.    In April, members met in Islamorada, Fla., to gather information for their report on the feasibility of protected areas in the United States. The meeting, held 30 miles northeast of Marathon, surrounded by the 3,674-square-mile Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, featured fishermen and scientists in the vanguard of designing marine reserves, a more restrictive step beyond existing marine sanctuaries in protecting ocean habitat and resources.    ``Everything else has failed,'' the chairman, Eduarde Houde, said of past policies that have focused on species-specific management. ``Marine Protected Areas are the last resort for fisheries management.''    The committee is reviewing data collected from sanctuaries and areas currently closed by regulation. According to scientists at Islamorada, protected areas represent a new paradigm in fisheries management: one that works. A national fisheries service scientist, Jim Bohnsack, pointed out the results of closing almost a third of Georges Bank off the Maine coast in 1994, creating a de facto protected areas. ``Only four years later,'' he said, ``haddock had increased to the point that the trip limit was raised from 500 pounds per day to 2,000 pounds per day.''    Some scientists and environmental organizations favor moving ahead with large closings immediately. But Graeme Kelleher, a committee member and a former vice chairman of the World Conservation Union's commission on protected areas, reminded participants, ``The success of MPAs depends on cooperation and support from the fishing community.'' Kelleher's experience in the South Pacific has shown ``that if we close half the reef, we get twice the fish. After a while fishermen start becoming advocates, but they have to be involved in the process from the very start.''    The advent of ecosystem management has brought more voices to the table. Scientists, ecotourists, and the public at large are claiming a stake in an area that was once the sole domain of fishermen. In Florida, a region leading the way in protected areas, fishermen, regulators, the tourism industry and conservationists have forged a fragile compromise on a 185-square-mile ``no take'' marine reserve in the Gulf of Mexico near the Dry Tortugas. They hope it will protect spawning aggregations of important species of snapper and grouper, and increase the overall fish population throughout the Keys.    Elsewhere, fishermen have been less agreeable to closed areas. In New England, inshore regulatory closings have led to angry meetings between regulators and user groups left with no place to fish.    And even in Florida, commercial fishermen pressured Gov.

At the all-volunteer garden, this is the time of year when potatoes grow larger than a man's fist, popping out of the soil, and five-foot-high cornstalks develop ears with red, yellow and white kernels ripening inside. The conditions on these wide plains near the Wind River Range of the Rocky Mountains can be harsh, with high winds, late springs and early autumns limit the growing season to 90 days.    Revere's partner in this effort is Irene Houser, director of the Northern Arapaho Tribe Community Services, who has distributed produce around the Wind River Reservation and to the Pine Ridge Reservation in southwestern South Dakota.    Ms. Houser, a member of the Northern Arapaho Tribe, said people were stunned when she brought them bushels of potatoes, onions, squash, zucchini, tomatoes, beets, radishes and other vegetables.    ``They asked, `How much are you going to charge me for this?''' she recalled. ``I said, `It's free,' and they were so happy. Many of them didn't have food in their house when I showed up.''    Mark Soldierwolf, a 70-year-old father of nine and grandfather of nine, said: ``That food lasted us about six weeks. We dried some things, boiled some. Just ate all of it.''    Soldierwolf, a Northern Arapaho who served with the Marines in World War II and the Korean War, lives with his wife, Florita, one daughter and one grandchild. They receive food stamps for a $300-a-month budget for the four of them, but they said they often fed members of their family who stopped by. Soldierwolf estimated they saved $70 with the free vegetables.    Soldierwolf's family represents the problems that plague many of the 1.3 million American Indians who live on reservations, of whom 49 percent are unemployed. The Bureau of Indian Affairs estimates that at least half the American Indian population lives in poverty. Soldierwolf said all but one of his adult children were unemployed.    ``If you can make it to the end of the month, you're all right,'' Soldierwolf said, referring to the monthly food stamps. ``It's worse than in the Depression.'' Mrs. Soldierwolf nodded, with tears in her eyes.    The Wyoming Department of Family Services says the Northern Arapaho on the reservation account for 18.9 percent of all welfare cases in Wyoming. The reservation population of 12,000 _ including 6,000 Northern Arapaho tribal members, about 3,000 Shoshone tribal members and 3,000 from other tribes _ represents about 2.5 percent of the state's population of 480,000.    Revere and Ms. Houser say the community garden can help reduce dependence on welfare by enabling residents to produce cash crops, traditional Indian plants to be sold on or off the reservation.    (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)    On the Crow Reservation in Montana, at a five-acre garden to be planted this fall, the plan is to let people's work part at the garden count toward fulfillment of their welfare community service requirement.    ``We are trying to provide people with skills that they can use here or take with them,'' said Charlene Johnson, a Crow tribal member and nutritionist with Indian Health Services. ``Indians are not horticulturists.

Herbs are so plentiful and full of flavor at this time of year that I always find myself experimenting more than usual. But it's a risky business _ these little things have very big flavors. They can easily overwhelm a dish or, in combination, fight each other so violently the dish is left in ruins.    So I don't use herbs indiscriminately or with abandon. No matter how casual the dish, there's rarely that handful-tossed-in-at-the-last-minute. I prefer a lighter, more subtle touch, one that lets the meat or fish or vegetable be the star, and the herbs a complement to their natural flavors.    I am, of course, especially careful with the stronger herbs like tarragon, sage, cilantro and rosemary. It's fine to have a dish flavored primarily with one of them, like tarragon chicken, but then, it's best to use the herb by itself, or with just a little of a light, fresh counterpart like parsley or chives. I'm also wary about mint or cilantro in cooked dishes. They have a tendency to taste medicinal once they are heated.    Once I've settled on the specifics, I tend to use the same technique with almost everything I cook with herbs, layering their flavors so they can be tasted in all their permutations. I like to start with a marinade or rub, and then finish the dish with chopped fresh herbs _ stirred into a sauce at the end of cooking, tossed into a salad that's served alongside or just sprinkled on as a garnish.    This lets you experience the herbs as they infuse the food while it marinates, as they cook and change in the heat, and in their natural state, lively and fresh, at the very end.    This chicken dish is a perfect example of that layering, and of my summertime experimentation. It shows how a wintry dish can be transformed with herbs, and a lot of trial and error, into something lighter and more seasonal.    Roast chicken is classic with a brown sauce and mashed potatoes, but I was looking for something lighter and brighter for the warm weather.    Putting a compound, or flavored butter under the chicken skin before roasting is a traditional way to add seasoning. But instead of using just butter, I use a lighter mix of olive oil and butter. And instead of using only three or four herbs, I use ten.    For something that sounds so simple, it turned out to be one of the harder dishes for me to develop. Deciding which herbs I would use was the easy part. I picked the ones whose flavors I knew would work well together. There are lots of fresh, minty-flavored ones _ cilantro, chervil, mint and parsley _ because they give the dish its zesty, summery quality.    The more complex, pronounced herbs _ licorice-flavored tarragon, piney rosemary and woodsy thyme _ add depth. Chives, oregano and sage round out the mix _ but there's no basil. I find that it fights with tarragon and rosemary.    Figuring out the proper proportion of each herb was the tricky part. I probably made this dish 20 times before I settled on a combination I was truly happy with.    Sometimes the rosemary would overpower everything, and I'd have a chicken that tasted like Vicks Vaporub. Other times, the tarragon would be too strong, and I'd have licorice chicken. One mix ended up tasting grassy, like lawn mower clippings.    We kept charts in the kitchen and marked off how much of each herb we used in the butter mixture, and how we would modify the next day's mix. All I wanted was a succulent chicken covered in a very crisp skin with a layer of herbs underneath.    We forged on. Eventually, I got the chicken I imagined, and the herb mixture became one of the few things we measure in the restaurant kitchen, to insure the right proportions.    I serve the chicken with a bread salad, made with the same herbs I use in the butter compound, plus lightly sauteed wild mushrooms and fresh tomato. In the end, it's the earthiness of the mushrooms

Pacheco's worries stem from the dropping price of Arizona's top   cash crop. Because of economic problems in Asia and a large  surplus, prices have dropped to half what his father made for  cotton in the 1950s.  Especially troubling for farmers like Pacheco is that for the   first time in eight years, American cotton growers won't have  federal dollars to help them export crops worldwide, said Wayne  Bjorlie of the U.S. Farm Service Agency.  The result? When Pacheco harvests his cotton this winter, he   might not be able to compete with cheaper cotton overseas. This  would make the surplus rise and prices slump even more.  ``I'm not sure if we're in a crisis situation now, but there   will be one in the future if something doesn't happen soon,'' said  Wiley Murphy, president of the Arizona Cotton Growers Association.  Cotton -- one of the Arizona's five C's along with copper,   citrus, climate and cattle -- is the state's biggest agricultural  crop.  In 1997, Arizona farmers produced 888,800 bales of cotton worth   $286 million. Much of this has been for export to such countries as  Japan.  Since 1991, the federal government has helped cotton farmers   compete with lower prices in other countries by paying exporters to  buy U.S. cotton. In 1996, Congress capped these export incentives  to $701 million -- enough money, lawmakers thought, to last until  2002.  But international cotton prices have slumped so low that the   money ran out last December.  ``Because we're exporting to foreign markets, every farmer is   hurting,'' said Lloyd Brown, a spokesman for the state Department  of Agriculture. ``There are some fruit and vegetable growers that  are doing well, but most are doing badly.''  This leaves farmers with few options, Brown said. They could try   raising pigs or planting wheat instead of cotton. But nothing is  going to make them much more money.  Every Arizona cotton farm is in jeopardy, Murphy said. At 55 to   65 cents per pound, farmers can't make enough to pay for fuel or  finance their farms.  ``I know I'm crazy for planting cotton right now,'' said Murphy,   who owns 600 acres of cotton fields in Marana. ``You need to get at  least 70 cents per pound to make ends meet.''  ------ YAKIMA, Wash. (AP) -- Take me out to the ballgame, buy me some   peanuts and Cracker Jack.  Or how about a DunkApple?   The Washington Apple Commission has signed a contract with the   Seattle Mariners to sell DunkApples -- sliced apples served with  tubs of caramel -- when the new Safeco Field opens in July.  Growers are hoping to develop sports fans as a new market for   apples. Eventually, the commission would like to introduce  DunkApples at stadiums around the country.  ``There's nothing like it in the ball park. You're looking at   chips, hot dogs and nachos,'' said Kevin Bredesen, the commission's  director of food service marketing in Wenatchee.  The commission has been looking for ways to increase domestic   consumption of apples, a crop getting bigger in this state. Last  year, Washington growers harvested 100 million 43-pound boxes.  DunkApples will sell for $2 to $3. The contracts with the   Mariners and the team's concessionaire, Volume Services America,  take effect in July and extend through the 2000 season.

But as her ``Barefoot Contessa Cookbook'' (Clarkson N. Potter, $32.50) now reveals, the food from her shop could not be more accessible.    Aside from a few omissions, like the temperature for baking the terrific chocolate buttercream cake, this is an excellent starter cookbook, to set the novice on the path to successful dinners and parties, especially looking toward summer. Bright photographs, by Melanie Acevedo, show exactly how most of the food should look, and illustrations show the differences between mincing, dicing, julienne and chiffonade.    The recipes are replete with nice little touches, like the black sesame seeds garnishing the oil-glossed sugar snap peas, and directions for roasting some of the tomatoes for the tomato-basil soup. But with few exceptions, like the lobster pot pie, they are not complicated.    Whenever possible, Ms. Garten suggests shortcuts, advance preparation and convenient substitutions, including canned and frozen vegetables and prepared mayonnaise. Feel free to use packaged puff pastry, and do not expect to have to bake your own bread to re-create her food.    Little notes accompany the recipes, elaborating on the ingredients and techniques. The navel orange segments specified in the pretty beet salad, for example, must be cut away from the membrane, not merely separated as when eating an orange.    All the dishes are designed for entertaining, whether it's plying weekend guests with staggeringly rich scones for breakfast, assembling an array of tasty dips to be scooped with endive leaves for cocktails, making a big turkey meatloaf for more than one meal or recycling extra grilled lemon chicken breasts into a salad.    Most of the recipes serve six or more, and many will feed 10. (That chocolate buttercream cake will serve up to 12; bake it at 350 degrees.)    Want to dazzle your guests? Try the roasted whole boned salmon with a fennel stuffing. It couldn't be easier, and it most certainly will produce raves when served at a buffet or dinner for 10 to 15.    BEETS WITH ORANGE VINAIGRETTE    Adapted from ``The Barefoot Contessa Cookbook''    Time: 1 1/2 hours    3 bunches fresh beets    Kosher salt    2 navel oranges    2 tablespoons raspberry vinegar    2 tablespoons freshly squeezed orange juice    3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil    1/2 teaspoon sugar    1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper    1/2 cup finely diced red onion.    1. Trim green tops from beets and place beets in large pot of salted water. Bring to a boil and simmer uncovered about 1 hour, or until just tender. Drain and set aside until cool enough to handle.    2. Remove zest from oranges, preferably in long strips. Slice off the rest of the skin and all the pith. Holding the oranges over a large bowl to catch any juice, use a sharp knife to cut the segments out, away from the membrane.    3. Peel and dice beets into 1/2-inch pieces. Add to bowl along with vinegar, orange juice, olive oil, sugar, pepper, red onion, orange zest and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, or to taste. Mix well.    4. Check seasonings and serve cold or at room temperature. Salad may be left to marinate in refrigerator a day or more.    Yield: 6 to 8 servings.

The hurricane, which pummeled the North Carolina coastline last week, took with it about 60 percent of the dune line along North Topsail Beach, the northernmost stretch of Topsail Island north of Wilmington. Erosion has chipped away at the 25-mile-long barrier island, and in a few places, its width has been whittled to about 150 yards.    The disappearance of parts of the dune line after large storms is not surprising, said Orrin Pilkey, a geologist at Duke University in Durham.    ``This is the most dangerous island community in North Carolina and one of the most dangerous along the East Coast,'' Pilkey said. ``The dunes are all artificial and extremely fragile, and, all in all, it's an island community that should not have been developed if common sense were to prevail.''    The island, once undeveloped and a haven for surf fishermen, has grown rapidly in the last few years as developers have built condominiums and resorts. Even Hurricanes Fran and Bertha two years ago, which knocked down first and second rows of houses in places on the beach, did not deter development.    Although it has taken time for homeowners to rebuild and for businesses to recoup losses, new houses replacing those damaged by the storms are scattered on the island. The hurricanes also took much of what remained of the island's maritime forests, which help slow erosion.    ``I've not seen a hurricane have a big impact on development just other than to bring in bigger and better buildings,'' Pilkey said. ``That's really fundamentally the impact these things have. It's really an urban renewal project.''    But hurricanes, development and the natural give and take of the tide have taken their toll on the dunes. While the southern end has maintained a larger natural berm, other parts of the island's dune system have had to be rebuilt. Sand from the island has repeatedly been bulldozed into 10-foot high piles, which offer some protection from the tides, but are not as stable as natural dunes and have to be replaced after storms.    ``I'd be willing to bet they lost 120 feet in the last 20 years,'' said Bill Cleary, a professor of geology at the Center for Marine Science Research at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington.    Tony Hammond, the town manager of North Topsail Beach, said the cost of replacing the dunes was justified if it saved houses.    ``The dunes that had the vegetation seem to have held up better,'' Hammond said. ``The ones with the limited vegetation didn't do as well.''    Pilkey said Topsail Island was never intended to accommodate development.    The constant chipping away of sand is proof that the island is doing what nature intends, he said. The island has a small natural sand supply and is at a stage where it is beginning what he calls true migration. Barrier islands such as Topsail become thin from erosion and begin over washing, which moves sand into the sounds that separate them from the mainland. The over washing widens the side closest to the mainland while the opposite side erodes.    ``That translates into island moving,'' Pilkey said. ``This is an island that wants to migrate.''    But homeowners do not like island migration. For several years, the town has used bulldozers to pile up the sand, creating an artificial dune system.    After Hurricane Fran, the Federal Emergency Management Agency reimbursed North Topsail Beach $1.6 million of the $2 million cost of creating an emergency berm, by bulldozing sand displaced by storms, said Jay Eaker, an agency spokesman.    Although these efforts will cause the island to migrate more slowly than it would naturally, Pilkey said, the process is inevitable.

DEBUG:simuser.user.query_generators.srex_refined_query:raw text: 1998-05-21   Feature: Kenyans Suffer as Lake Victoria Waters  (by Xu Jianmei) Fear and panic are gripping south-western Kenyan region ashore Lake Victoria as its waters have continued rising since last week, wreaking havoc and displacing hundreds of people. Families are stranded with no food, livestock trapped and drowned in the floods and crops ruined. Villages and schools have been swept away and other houses submerged as the lake waters engulf the mainland. Hundreds of acres of farmland, mainly under maize, sorghum and sugarcane, are flooded with the crops destroyed. The Kenyan government on Wednesday announced plans to evacuate families ashore Lake Victoria, the second largest fresh water lake in the world. But efforts by the Kenyan government to rescue the displaced have been hampered by poor roads, which were made impassable by the floods, while the lack of communication also worsens the situation. All telephone lines in government offices in the affected areas have been disconnected over unpaid phone bills and thus has made it difficult to monitor the situation and file an accurate report, said an official in Kisumu, the largest city ashore the lake. Now rivers of Nyando, Sondu-Miriu, Yala and Nzoia, with the help of their tributaries, have swept into the lake large amounts of silt and vegetation from the catchment areas of the western highlands. From Osodo Bay to Winam Gulf, the land is flooded, a field report from the Daily Nation newspaper confirmed Thursday. As the water rises, villagers -- many of them fishermen -- have fled to safer and drier land, leaving their homes and possessions covered in a thick layer of marshland vegetation, said the report. Many grass-thatched houses collapsed, their soaked mud walls crumbling and bringing down the roofs. The floated carcasses of drowned animals drifted slowly on the flood waters between tall trees, as patient vultures circled above. Men, women and children carrying a few belongings on their heads, waded through the waist-high waters to safety. The flooding has raised fears of disease. Last year, water-borne diseases such as typhoid, cholera and diarrhoea swept across the region, claiming scores of lives. The lake supports some 25 million people, 10 million being in Kenya, although it only holds about six percent of the lake's 2,760 cubic km of water with Tanzania 49 percent and Uganda 45 percent. The floods have also sparked heated debate about its causes with some experts arguing the phenomenon, last seen in early 1960s, is mainly a result of siltation due to the blockage of river estuaries by the hyacinth weed. The blockage by water hyacinth forced silt deposits in the shallow sections of the lake, damming the rivers and causing floods, says William Saina, an agricultural expert. He attributed more siltation to destruction of trees and cultivation in water catchment areas in highlands near the Rift Valley province. On Sunday, a marine expert, Joseph Mucuthi, also said the hyacinth weed runs riot with roots and leaves having collected at the bottom of the lake, making it shallower, hence the overflow. Another reason is the shoreline which is now shrinking towards the lake as it has not been surveyed for more than 50 years, Mucuthi said. However, Dr Geoffrey Howard of the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources said Monday the hyacinth invasion is an unlikely cause of the water rise as 92 percent of the weed is water. Rainfall increase might be the cause, that is, if the totals are abnormally high as the one experienced in 1960, Howard said. Water hyacinth is likely to increase the rate of evaporation hence decreasing water levels, he argued.

DEBUG:simuser.user.query_generators.srex_refined_query:raw text: THE SHRIMP AND THE LOBSTER GET COMPETITION  Like many immigrants to the United States, the little crustaceans known as langoustines have been arriving here in greater numbers because of bad times elsewhere in the world.    These creatures, which look like sawed-off lobsters and taste a little like lobster and a little like shrimp, have long been a delicacy in European restaurants but have played second fiddle to shrimp in the United States. Then along came Hurricane Mitch.    As it raged along the coasts of Central and South America last October, the storm wiped out hundreds of shrimp farms that supplied the North American market. Within months of the devastation, particularly in Ecuador and Honduras, shrimp from Asia started filling in the gap. But in the interim, chefs and adventurous home cooks started asking fish suppliers for langoustines, and that demand has not abated.    Luis Polcano, manager of the fish department at Balducci's in Greenwich Village, points out that before the hurricane, langoustines cost $12.99 a pound and were not a big mover. After the hurricane, when demand jumped, the price rose to $15.99, ``and I sell more and more every week,'' he said.    Like anything unfamiliar that is pushed into the limelight, langoustines have to battle some misconceptions as to what they are. They are frequently confused with langoustes, or spiny lobsters, the slender, tough-shelled cousins of the American lobster. Langoustines are also often sold as prawns, though biologically they are only distant cousins.    Most of them that are sold here come from waters off Iceland, Norway, the Brittany coast of France and New Zealand, though they are also caught in the Adriatic and the Mediterranean. Usually about 7 inches long and about as wide as a fat thumb, langoustines have narrow, elongated claws and shells as thick as hard-shelled crabs. Their meat, which resides entirely in the 1- to 2-inch-long tail, is delicate but rich.    Unlike shrimp or lobster, langoustine meat begins to deteriorate immediately after the creatures die, due to a bacteria underneath the shells that breaks down the meat and turns it mushy, said Rod Mitchell, the owner of Browne Trading Co., a seafood and caviar importer in Portland, Maine. For this reason, whole langoustines are usually available only by special order; their tails are most frequently sold cooked and frozen. Happily, the blue and brown crustaceans, whose shells turn ruby red when cooked, lose little when frozen.    But because their flesh is extremely fragile and perishable, langoustines can take only a short blast of high heat in a skillet, wok or on the grill. They can be treated like crayfish on the bayou, boiled in a spicy broth, chilled and eaten right from their shells. They can be sauteed with lots of garlic and tossed with pasta and parsley, or marinated in olive oil and lemon and broiled on kebobs.    Brushed with butter or olive oil and quickly turned on a very hot grill, langoustine tails remain moist and succulent, tasting sweet, faintly briny and buttery. They make a great warm-weather meal.    But since langoustines arrived in the United States as a luxury good, rather than as a huddled mass of cheap food, the crustaceans are finding a home in more elaborate, highly nuanced dishes. Marc Murphy, the chef of La Fourchette in Manhattan, balances the richness of grilled langoustines by serving them with wilted arugula and a sharp gazpacho sauce. In Boston, Lydia Shire, the chef and owner of Biba, uses langoustines as a delicate base note in mildly curried fritters that she serves with a sweet and sour peach chutney. Eric Ripert, the chef at Le Bernardin in New York, emphasizes the richness of the shellfish by using them in butter and cream sauces for mild white fish.    More than likely, any misunderstanding of langoustines will be short-lived. Their sweet, succulent, delicate flavor is sure to make them as much a commodity in the American kitchen as they have long been in Europe.    GRILLED LANGOUSTINES WITH WILTED ARUGULA AND GA

DEBUG:simuser.user.query_generators.srex_refined_query:raw text: THREE AND A HALF HOURS TO FRANCE, BY CAR  As Route 9 shoots southward from Saratoga Springs, the grand Victorian mansions of the old spa yield to the familiar outposts of American road culture.    There are gas stations and convenience stores, a vegetable stand, a lawn-ornament emporium, a drive-in barbecue joint with picnic tables, and the rusticated cabins of the Thorobred Motel. It takes a sharp eye to pick out, on the left, the silver diner with the small rooftop sign: Chez Sophie Bistro.    The motorist who whizzes by in the afternoon is entitled to feel a twinge of pity. That empty parking lot. That lonely diner. And just think of the misguided idealists who thought they could sell French food out in the wilderness.    But as dusk approaches, car after car takes a sharp left turn into Sophie's. By 7, the lot is full, and so is the restaurant.    What they have found is a tiny bit of France 3,500 miles from Paris, the neighborhood bistro that every New Yorker dreams of _ located, unfortunately, in a neighborhood that takes three and a half hours to reach by car.    Chez Sophie is worth the drive. For nearly 30 years, it has been serving classic bistro dishes, the kind of deceptively simple food that, for the French, makes life worth living.    In that time, the menu, printed on a mimeographed sheet of paper, has scarcely budged. The customers won't let it. They want the caneton a la Sophie, tender slices of duck breast in a sweetly piquant apricot and green pepper sauce. They demand the veal scallops in a cream and lemon sauce.    Up and down the Hudson, innkeepers and new-wave restaurateurs have made giant strides raising the region's culinary standards over the past decade. But Chez Sophie has been there all along, with a single cook in the kitchen turning out one flawless dish after another.    Yes, there is a Sophie. She is French, despite her all-American last name (Parker), and six nights a week she serves 40 to 50 meals to customers who, in many cases, have eaten at the restaurant more than 100 times. At the age of 73, she rules over a kitchen staff of precisely two, not counting the dishwashers.    Her husband, Joseph, takes reservations, greets and seats and keeps the diners happy. Her son, Paul, waits on tables and buys the food and wine.    Bill and Kimberley Comiskey from nearby Malta eat at Sophie's every Friday night, in the same booth. They have done so ever since the restaurant moved to the diner about three years ago. That adds up to more than 150 meals, but the actual total runs much higher, because they come with friends on other nights and celebrate at Sophie's on special occasions.    ``This is the place we compare others to,'' said Ms. Comiskey, who operates a day spa in Latham. ``It's our benchmark.''    Mrs. Parker herself makes very limited claims for the place.    ``I do very simple things, actually,'' she said, seated at a front booth in her chef whites early one afternoon, before the day's cooking got under way. ``I don't even think of it as French, really, I just think of it as good food.''    In a way, the modesty is understandable. Chez Sophie cruises along with a set menu of seven appetizers, eight main courses (plus a fish and pasta of the day), and seven desserts. The wine list fits on two sides of a piece of typewriter paper: 39 whites on one side, 38 reds on the other.    There's a nice list of Belgian beers. The appetizers are priced from $4.50 to $10, the entrees from $21 to $29.    The offerings are pre-nouvelle: country pate, escargots in butter and garlic, roasted poussin, steak with peppercorn sauce, chocolate mousse. There are a few contemporary touches, like a veal chop roasted with portobello and shiitake mushrooms, and quail in a currant sauce enlivened with balsamic vinegar, but that's as wild as things get.    Within tight, traditional limits, however, Chez Sophie makes good on the promise implicit in the name ``bistro.'' The ingredients are fresh, the flavors pristine, the presentation unfussy.

Dill with some weight on it. the brightest bulb on the American food scene.    New York City caterer-to-the-stars Pamela Morgan has several recipes for the licorice-flavored vegetable in her just-published ``Flavors.''    ``It's so fresh and crisp,'' she says, ``and you can use the tops for garnish. And it's available just about year-round.''    Indeed. You can use the whole plant, from the bulb to the feathery fronds to the seeds. It's three, three, three foods in one.    Long a staple in Mediterranean cuisines, fennel has made its way to the heartland of America. And the newest cookbooks are brimming with the discovery.    Morgan offers an olive melange with fennel seeds, and low-fat tuna and fennel salad pitas. Steven Raichlen stuffs the bulb into sea bass in ``The Barbecue! Bible.'' Raichlen also dries the stalks and throws them on the fire to perfume the smoke. James Peterson even deep-fries fennel in his just-published ``Vegetables.''    Fennel's natural season is fall through late spring, but with the miracle of modern supermarkets and importing, it's available all year. Which is good, because the clean, crisp flavor is a welcome summer taste.    Sometimes labeled ``anise,'' larger bulbs will probably be fibrous and should be peeled with a vegetable peeler. To maintain crispness, don't cut up fennel until ready to prepare.

Add chopped peppers, fennel, onion, carrot, leeks, thyme, garlic, fennel seeds and bay leaves. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are almost tender, about 20 minutes. Add chicken stock, wine, Pernod and 1 tablespoon salt. Bring to a simmer, partially cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are very tender, about 30 minutes.    Cool soup and remove bay leaves. Puree soup in batches in food processor or blender, or force it through the medium blade of a food mill. Refrigerate until very cold, at least 5 hours or preferably overnight.    Adjust salt and season the soup generously with fresh black pepper.

Maybe it's because this unglamorous cut brings out the Henry Higgins in them.    In the right hands, and with enough care and patience, these steer ribs, the ends of the prime ribs, which start out all toughness, show their elegant and tender side.    For Terrance Brennan, the chef and owner of Picholine, on West 64th Street, a braised short rib is a three-day affair. One day is just for marinating, another is for braising and a third is for rest, to allow the meat to wallow languorously in the sauce, all the while becoming richer and deeper in flavor. With a last-minute Provencal flourish, Brennan tosses in some nicoise olives and anchovy fillets.    For Brennan, short ribs have three big charms. ``There's texture, richness, fattiness,'' he said.    (Ah yes, the fattiness. This is no dieter's delight: It has about twice the calories of a pot roast made with lean choice round. But the high fat content is part of what makes short ribs so delectable. A lovely alchemy takes place in the braising as the fats and connective tissue, those great carriers of flavor, slowly and imperceptibly dissolve into the sauce.)    At the Lobster Club, on East 80th Street, Anne Rosenzweig, the chef and owner, sears the ribs, braises them with onions, garlic, brown sugar, veal stock and a dark ale like porter or stout.    In the last few minutes, she brushes the ribs with a mustard and white wine mixture, dredges them in bread crumbs and grills them for two minutes until they become crusty.Then she stirs three Moroccan ingredients _ bright orange dices of pumpkin, emerald green kale and cream-colored chickpeas _ into the dark burnished sauce and places the ribs on top.    The sauce points up the inherent sweetness of the meat, while the kale and mustard add a little bite. The dish looks like gleaming mahogany.    At Gertrude's, on East 61st Street, Laurent Manrique, the owner and chef, makes short ribs exactly the way his grandmother Aurelie Frayet made them for him when he was a little boy in the Gascogne region of France. He marinates the ribs overnight in a mix of carrots, celery, onions, garlic, herbs and a hefty red wine, like Cahors or Madiran.    The next day, he sears the ribs, sautees the vegetables and braises the meat for three hours in wine and veal stock. To add richness to richness, he makes a sauce of sauteed porcini mushrooms, onions, garlic and prunes, which he mixes into the earthy, soul-warming dish.    But not all tasty recipes for short ribs require a dozen ingredients. Rozanne Gold, the author of the new ``Recipes 1-2-3 Menu Cookbook'' (Little, Brown, 1998), uses only three: the ribs, hoisin sauce and zinfandel. ``Water doesn't count,'' she said.    Book publishers may guess and gamble as to which title will be a best seller. But in the restaurant world, it seems, you can't go wrong with short ribs, especially in cold weather.    Ms. Rosenzweig estimated that at her last restaurant, Arcadia, which closed in June, half of the orders were for short ribs on any cold night. Manrique of Gertrude's placed this figure at one-third.    When Gray Kunz, the former executive chef at L'Espinasse, added short ribs braised in a horseradish and Meaux mustard sauce to the menu in 1995, nobody flinched at the $38 price.    In winter, he estimated, one-quarter of the entrees would be short ribs, making it the restaurant's most popular dish.    ``Two years ago, I wanted to take it off the summer menu,'' Kunz said. But popular demand won out.    Several chefs said they preferred short ribs to filet mignon.    ``Filet lacks flavor,'' Marc Murphy, executive chef at La Fourchette, said.    For her part, Ms. Gold said, ``Eating a steak is a one-dimensional experience _ but with short ribs, you get this gorgeous dark color, smell, sight, taste and texture.''

Liver, for example, or sweetbreads or even some bitter Asian greens cause many diners to just say, ``Yuck!''    High on this list are the so-called oily fish, like mackerel, bluefish, pompano and sardines. These dark-fleshed fish are routinely passed over in favor of their milder white-fleshed cousins. But for anyone who appreciates real flavor, this is a serious error, because these fish have what those ubiquitous white fish do not: rich, distinctive taste.    So why does it take courage to face these fish? Perhaps the dark color is a bit daunting to neophytes. But mostly the same high oil content that makes these fish so flavorful also makes them very perishable. Many an unsuspecting diner has bought or been served a less-than-fresh version and was left to believe that that was the way the fish was supposed to taste. End of experiment.    This problem should be a thing of the past. With improved methods of bringing fish to market, it is not that difficult to find very fresh bluefish, mackerel, sardines, pompano or their highly popular colleagues in this group, tuna and salmon.    Once a food has a tarnished reputation, though, it can be hard to rehabilitate it. So perhaps a bit of attitude adjustment is in order. Instead of thinking of these fish as oily, consider them rich-fleshed, and health-enhancing, too.    Making this mental change-over can bring great rewards. Stronger flavors are intrinsically more interesting to the adventurous palate and can also hold their own with aggressive ingredients like hot chilies, tangy citrus and briny olives. This allows the cook a much wider latitude in creating bold dishes.    Rich-fleshed fish also have an advantage when it comes to cooking methods. Because their high oil content keeps them moist and helps prevent their sticking to cooking surfaces, they lend themselves well to grilling or broiling. For the same reason, they are ideally suited to smoking, a technique that imparts deep, rich flavors to seafood.    And in a deliciously paradoxical twist, the health benefits of these fish come from that bad boy of nutritional policy, fat. Called omega-3 fatty acids, the fats in these fish are thought to have many benefits, the best-established being the prevention of heart problems. Omega-3's have been repeatedly shown to help prevent heart attacks.    Some experts, including researchers at the Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of California at Los Angeles, believe that these fats may also help reduce the risk of breast cancer. In some patients, omega-3's have also been able to reduce the painful symptoms of autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis.    But the latest _ and most surprising _ word on omega-3's is that they may help make people not only healthier but happier. This is the opinion of Dr. Joseph Hibbeln, the chief of the outpatient clinic at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, part of the National Institutes of Health.    After correlating immense amounts of data on diets and the incidence of clinical depression in various countries, Hibbeln found that the more fish people eat, the less they seem to suffer from depression.    This theory was bolstered earlier this year when scientists in England found that individuals suffering from clinical depression had significantly lower levels of docosahexaenoic acid, a primary component of omega-3's, in their blood cells.    Fortunately, there are many fish to choose from if you want to get the flavor and health advantages of omega-3's. While very dark-fleshed fish like mackerel, sardines and herring are the highest in oil content, rainbow trout, lake trout and the ever-popular salmon are also prime examples.    A single serving of Atlantic salmon, for instance, contains 18 times as much omega-3 as the same-size piece of cod or mahi-mahi. Whichever of these fish you choose, buy only the very freshest. They are almost always sold as whole fish, which yo

A 2,000-page IAEA study compiled by dozens of scientists from 18 countries was requested by the French government after testing stopped in French Polynesia in 1996.    The testing had made France a virtual pariah on the world stage, especially to nations of the South Pacific, a region it led and shaped for 200 years.    Australia and New Zealand, as well as several tiny island-states claimed the atomic tests could have harmed the fragile environment. The last tests ending early in 1996 drew especially strident protests from these nations as well as environmental groups.    France maintained the tests caused no lasting harm and requested the independent analysis.    The study, released Monday, said radioactive material in the earth and sea around Mururoa and Fangataufa atolls was ``at generally very low concentrations,'' and ``of no radiological significance.''    The study _ which will be presented to a June 30-July 3 congress in Vienna of government officials and scientists _ found that lingering nuclear contamination was unlikely to damage the natural environment.    IAEA officials said they arrived at their conclusions by studying marine life and vegetation, and water and air samples.    But the study also said there were four small zones in remote areas with excessive plutonium levels as a result of earlier atmospheric tests in the 1960s.    IAEA spokesman David Kyd said there would be no danger posed to human life even if there was a ``catastrophic scenario'' such as a landslide under lagoons where explosions were carried out.    France exploded at least 123 nuclear bombs in the volcanic rock underneath Mururoa Atoll between 1975 and 1996 and eight under nearby Fangataufa Atoll.    The report added that there would be ``no change'' in cancer incidence rates in the region attributable to radiation exposure caused by radioactive material at and around the sites.    In 1996, France announced it would stop nuclear tests, sign the nuclear test ban treaty, and return the islands to the civil authorities of French Polynesia in pristine condition by 1998.    France said the last series of tests was necessary to ensure the viability of its nuclear arsenal and develop simulation technology.

She would braise a whole leg with olives and lemon, and those flavors, so wonderfully Mediterranean, are one of my earliest taste memories. When I think of lamb, that dish instantly comes to mind.    I wanted to recreate it at the restaurant, but I needed to cook smaller portions, so they could be roasted to order, and I wanted to expand on the flavors just a bit.    I switched to thick triple lamb chops, because they are tender enough to endure the kind of heat needed to get a nice crust. And still thinking Mediterranean, I hit on the idea of adding capers and anchovy to the olive-lemon marinade, making it almost a tapenade.    All these strong, salty ingredients may sound like a very intense combination, but they really mellow as the lamb is roasted. (We use a wood-burning oven, but a regular oven at a very high heat will give most of the same results.)    It's important to marinate the lamb at least four hours. During that time, it is actually curing a little bit from the salt in the olives, capers and anchovy. (You might notice that the marinade doesn't call for any added salt; it just doesn't need it.) A mild curing makes meat a little more tender, but more important, it takes out water and concentrates fat, almost like dry aging. In the end the chop has a moister and less grainy quality.    At the very end of cooking, I deglaze the pan with wine, lemon juice and stock (we use lamb stock, but you can use chicken or beef broth), then toss in some thinly sliced lemons and more olives.    The liquids quickly reduce and form a simple sauce. The lemon slices and olives, which get nicely charred in the heat, add a final burst of flavor and look beautiful on the plate. To keep the Mediterranean mood, serve the chops with couscous or grilled vegetables. A bright sprinkling of chopped parsley is all the garnish you'll need.    ROASTED TRIPLE LAMB CHOPS WITH OLIVES AND LEMON    Time: 30 minutes, plus 4 hours to marinate    One-third cup extra virgin olive oil    3 tablespoons black oil-cured olives, pitted    1 tablespoon capers    2 teaspoons chopped parsley, plus extra for garnish    1 teaspoon chopped garlic    1 teaspoon chopped shallot    \ teaspoon ground cumin    1 anchovy fillet    Freshly ground black pepper to taste    4 8-ounce, 3-bone racks of lamb, Frenched by butcher    1 lemon    \ cup white wine    \ cup chicken stock    1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice.    1. In a food processor, combine olive oil, 1 tablespoon olives, capers, parsley, garlic, shallot, cumin, anchovy and pepper. Coat lamb with this marinade, and place in a bowl. Cover, and refrigerate at least 4 hours, or overnight.    2. Thinly slice lemon and remove seeds. Cut slices into quarters. Reserve.    3. Preheat oven to 500 degrees. Arrange racks of lamb in a roasting pan large enough to hold them in one layer (or use two pans). Drizzle any marinade left in bottom of bowl over lamb. Roast lamb 7 minutes.    4. Transfer lamb to a plate. Pour off fat from roasting pan, and add white wine, chicken stock and lemon juice. Return lamb to pan, browned side down. Sprinkle lamb with remaining olives and lemon slices. Roast 7 to 9 minutes more, or to taste. Garnish with chopped parsley, and serve.    Yield: 4 servings.

Some 25 million farmers in Hebei benefited from vegetable growing. The vegetable growing area in Hebei reached 723,000 hectares in 1997, with 213,600 hectares in greenhouses, 10 times that of 1992. The provincial government and vegetable growers in Hebei invest a combined 10 billion yuan annually in vegetable production, starting from 1993. With the advantage of neighboring Beijing and Tianjin municipalities, Hebei has set up four vegetable production and sales bases in the counties around Beijing and Tianjin. Vegetables from Hebei now cover 36 percent of the vegetable wholesale markets in Beijing. Hebei has also established vegetable wholesale relations with over 20 cities. It sells some 18 million tons of vegetables a year to other Chinese provinces. Hebei has also adjusted its vegetable growing structure, shifting from quantity to quality by improving growing techniques. The province now grows 130 types of fine brand vegetables, of which are eight state-level and 30 province-level brand name vegetables. At the end of 1997, 84 percent of vegetables produced in the province entered the market. The province has also formed 52 vegetable processing enterprises with an annual capacity of 420,000 tons.

After all, you deserve more than carryout or food from a frozen cardboard box each night. And so does your family. We know everyone is busy, especially during the week. But with well-planned cooking sessions on Sunday afternoon, you can enjoy big, family-style Sunday dinners and then some fast and fabulous meals during the week. Taking a cue from a new cookbook, ``Cooking for the Week,'' by Diane Morgan, Dan Taggart and Kathleen Taggart (Chronicle Books, $18.95), we offer a menu here for a month of Sundays, and all the days in between.    JAN. 30    Spaghetti and meatballs    Make double batches of spicy tomato sauce and meatloaf mixture. Put half the meatloaf in a loaf pan, wrap tightly and freeze until midweek. With the remaining, make meatballs. Combine with sauce and spaghetti and you'll have a Super Bowl crowd-pleaser. Put one quart of sauce in the refrigerator and two quarts in the freezer.    JAN. 31    Meatball subs    Take leftover meatballs and nest them in hoagie rolls. Spoon tomato sauce over the meatballs and then blanket with slices of mozzarella cheese. Wrap each sandwich with aluminum foil and heat in a 400 degree oven for about 10 minutes.    February    1Vegetarian pizza    Take Sunday's tomato sauce, thicken it with a bit of tomato paste or spice it up with an extra dash of crushed red pepper. Spread on a homemade or store-bought pizza crust, top with mushrooms, chopped green pepper and chopped onion (or your other favorite veggies), sprinkle with mozzarella cheese and bake.    2 Meatloaf    and mashed potatoes    Tonight, bake the meatloaf. While it's cooking, make a hearty portion of mashed potatoes (you want leftovers). As soon as the meatloaf comes out of the oven, put trimmed asparagus on a cookie sheet, drizzle with olive oil, sprinkle with salt and stick under the broiler for 4 minutes. Heat some tomato sauce to spoon over the meatloaf.    3Potato cakes    and green salad    Combine 2 cups mashed potatoes with one large beaten egg. Stir in 6 tablespoons of flour. Add 1 1/2 tablespoons of grated onion, 1/2 teaspoon dried marjoram, salt and pepper to taste. Drop by heaping spoonfuls into a heavy skillet with 1/8-inch of hot vegetable oil. Flatten with spoon and fry on each side for 1 minute. Top with poached egg if desired. Serve with green salad.    4Shrimp braised in oil    Cookbook author Mark Bittman calls this a flavor bath. Combine 1/3 cup olive oil and 4 cloves of sliced garlic in a 10-inch skillet over medium heat. When the garlic begins to sizzle, add 1 teaspoon each of cumin and paprika. Increase heat to medium-high and add 2 pounds of medium shrimp. Stir and cook until shrimp are pink. Serve over rice.    5 Pork chops, macaroni    and cheese and spinach    For a comfy Saturday night feast, make macaroni and cheese in a large casserole dish (save half for Sunday). Broil or fry some pork chops and steam some spinach.    6 Roast chicken    Roast two chickens (save one), steam two bunches of broccoli (save one); reheat mac and cheese. Make a double recipe of your favorite drop biscuit recipe with 1/2 cup of chopped fresh herbs (put 8 in the freezer). Finish with raspberry ice cream: Puree 2 (10-ounce) packs of frozen raspberries, 2 cups of cream and 1/4 cup of confectioners' sugar. Freeze 2 hours.    7 Biscuit-topped chicken pie    Remember the chicken pot pies of yore? Here's a quickie version that's delicious. Combine chopped chicken with carrots, mushrooms and a cream sauce. Pour into a casserole dish and top with the leftover herbed biscuits. Heat and eat.    8 Linguine with broccoli    Toss some linguine with olive oil, steamed broccoli from Sunday and crumbled blue cheese. For an extra layer of flavor, add toasted pecans. Simply spread pecans on a baking sheet and heat at 350 degrees for 5-7 minutes. Serve with a crisp white wine.    9 Asian chicken salad    Toss together shredded green lettuce, chicken chunks, broken Ramen noodles

The droughty conditions will abate in a few spots as towering cumulus clouds yield potent afternoon thunderstorms. The strongest storms will erupt near the east Florida coast where a developing sea breeze front lifts the very sultry air. Large hail and frequent lightning are possible. Meanwhile, ample sun will cover the interior Southeast with some isolated thunderstorms.    Low clouds and fog will plague eastern New England Tuesday as moist onshore breezes persist. Clouds will yield to hazy sun over the interior where isolated afternoon thundershowers are possible. Overcast conditions will hug the southeast New England coast much of the day.    A cluster of showers and strong thunderstorms will accompany a jet stream disturbance crossing the upper Ohio Valley and central Appalachians. Very heavy rain will occur in a few of the thunderstorms. Farther west, plenty of sunshine and slightly less humid air will spread into the northern Great Lakes as high pressure arrives from Ontario.    Brisk winds from the south will transport hot and increasingly humid into the central and northern Plains Tuesday. As the muggy air intercepts a slow-moving front, severe thunderstorms capable of spawning tornadoes will develop over the Dakotas and Nebraska.    Isolated thunderstorms will form in parts of the northern Rockies as a jet stream disturbance passes overhead. The remainder of the West will be dry and mainly sunny though low clouds will cover sections of the Pacific coast.    Focus: Pennsylvania Deluge    A thunderstorm stalled over the southern Poconos on Sunday afternoon and deposited 5.5 inches of rain in three hours on Lehighton. There were estimates of as much as 7 inches in parts of Carbon County in northeastern Pennsylvania with serious flooding. The storm formed along the boundary between marine air covering much of southern New England and a steamy air mass over the Middle Atlantic states. A weather balloon launched from New York City at daybreak on Sunday indicated winds were less than 15 miles an hour from the ground to 30,000 feet, and this was the prime ingredient for sluggish storms. Only minor changes in the weather pattern Tuesday could raise the risk of more slow-moving storms near the East Coast. &QL;

The province exports about 250,000 tons of vegetables to Hong Kong annually, accounting for about 80 percent of China's total and making up around 80 percent of Hong Kong's market needs. GDCIB vice-president Zhan Siming said apart from the climate, which is beneficial to vegetable growing, and Guangdong's favorable geographical location, the measures taken by GDCIB to ensure safety, hygiene and the punctual delivery of vegetables also contribute significantly to exports. Zhan said to guarantee the safety and hygiene of the vegetables, GDCIB has laid down several regulations, including the Provincial Hygiene Quality Examination and Inspection Administration Temporary Regulations for Fresh Vegetables Exported to Hong Kong and Macao. Such regulations provide clear and concise guidelines for the labelling system, the responsibilities borne by vegetable growers and collectors, and even the dosages of pesticide. And GDCIB has offered 11 terms' worth of courses for more than 300 vegetable growing and collection supervisors to make sure that inspection covers every detail of vegetable growing and processing. GDCIB has purchased advanced instruments and facilities worth more than 50 million yuan to strengthen the quality inspection work on vegetables sent to Hong Kong. Research has also been applied advanced facilities to vegetable examination to speed up the delivery of vegetables destined for Hong Kong. In the meantime, GDCIB has been co-operating with its counterpart in Hong Kong to crack down on illegal vegetable exports to Hong Kong. GDCIB compares notes with its counterpart in Hong Kong twice a year. The measures GDCIB has taken have benefited both Hong Kong residents and the province's vegetable growers, Zhan said, as Hong Kong residents can feel free to enjoy the vegetables from Guangdong and the province's vegetable growers can make handsome profits.

Wang Xiaobing, an official with the Ministry of Agriculture, said the Chinese government is making efforts to please Chinese housewives by filling their vegetable baskets through the use of science and technology. The well-to-do Chinese families not only need a sufficient supply of vegetables, but also hope to taste what vegetables should be, he said. Modern science and technology have not only helped increase the vegetable output in China, but spoiled their tastes partly due to the use of fertilizers, said Chai Min, a staff member with the China Vegetable Seed-Breeding Center. So the government also needs to turn to science and technology to make Chinese food taste better and more delicious, he added. Wang noted that both rural and urban vegetable markets are now steadily priced and sufficiently supplied, though Chinese families are demanding more vegetables to meet their tastes. He went on to say that China has made some progress in this field during the past few years. North China's Shanxi Province has spread 138 types of vegetable seeds during the past five years. Liaoning Province in the northeast and Qinghai Province in northwest of China have also made progress in reducing fertilizer use on vegetables, he added. China will also conduct a study on seed-breeding, and increasing nutrition of vegetables soon, Wang said. To make Chinese vegetables safer for consumers, the Ministry of Agriculture will pass a regulation guiding the production and technological process of vegetables this year, he said.

You know, though, that a serious cook lives there the minute you walk into the spacious, modern kitchen. Not that the room gleams with marble and stainless steel like a designer's fantasy, or that it's packed with gimmicks and gadgets, or that everything matches. Utility is the hallmark here. A bright yellow La Cornue range stands along one wall, and a big rectangular copper sink catches the eye, but at heart, this is a kitchen made for cooking, not looking.    One Tuesday morning in early November, it was dressed for autumn. Branches of red and orange and mottled yellow leaves filled a handsome purple glass vase, along with blowsy Cafe au Lait dahlias and yellow English Garden roses.    The mistress of the house had laid out big bowls of pomegranates and persimmons, walnuts and chestnuts, Ida Rose apples and Adriatic figs and crab apples. Quinces, too, that someone had filched from an old tree on a vacant lot nearby. A stalk of brussels sprouts lay on the table, and a cabbage, a Platonic ideal of a cabbage, its outer leaves unfurled into a sort of halo, sat on a metal stand.    Food as still life, fit for a 17th-century Dutch master.    An oak fire, lighted at 7 o'clock, had produced a fine bed of coals beneath the plump hen turkey that was revolving on a stout spit. Alice Waters (for it was she, in a long striped apron and black chef's clogs) was rehearsing for Thanksgiving 1999, reaching into the kitchen fireplace with a long branch of rosemary to baste the browning bird with warm olive oil.    Why a rosemary branch?    ``Why not?'' Ms. Waters replied. ``It's pretty, and it works well, and it adds a bit of flavor.''    By the time I turned up to watch, along with my wife, Betsey, two of Ms. Waters' longtime colleagues at Chez Panisse, the influential Berkeley restaurant she has run since 1971, had joined her. They were trimming vegetables with the short, sure strokes of the professional that make amateurs like me so jealous. Both of them _ Jean-Pierre Moulle, a bearded, soft-spoken native of the Charente region in southwestern France, and Fritz Streiff, a Harvard man who wears Philip Johnson glasses _ have helped her to establish the restaurant's worldwide reputation for extraordinarily fresh, organically grown raw materials, cooked simply and superbly in a hybrid Italo-Franco-Californian style.    ``It's the first real day of fall,'' Moulle said. In the backyard garden, pomelos and Meyer lemons still hung from the trees, and exactly four raspberries fought against time on a bush near the guest cottage, but there was a nip in the air that the bright sunshine could not quite dispel.    As they worked, the three cooks chatted about the provenance of the ingredients that would go into Ms. Waters' Thanksgiving feast. The unusually fine-leaved escarole and the fabulously peppery watercress for the salad had been grown by Bob Cannard in the Valley of the Moon in Sonoma County, northwest of Berkeley. The sourdough bread had come, of course, from the Acme Bakery just a few blocks away, one of the cluster of establishments that have flourished here since the food revolution began 30-odd years ago. The vegetables had come from various farmers' markets, and the cranberries for the upside-down cake baked by the restaurant's pastry chef, Charlene Reis, from the Ladybug Cooperative in Oregon.    ``I could have, would have, should have made the cake, if I'd had the time,'' volunteered Ms. Waters, an intense, pale-skinned woman who was once a Montessori teacher. ``It's easy enough for even me to do.''    The cranberries really slayed me. You have to be a bit of a maniac to conceive of organic cranberries, let alone find them, and Ms. Waters pleaded guilty.    ``Sometimes you go to extremes,'' she said.    She has gone so far as to hire a forager, Alan Tangren, who searches not only for wild nettles a

Qi Dianhua, a local vegetable grower, said that they used to grow vegetables only for themselves or traded them at a local market to exchange for some edible oil and salt. Nowadays we grow vegetables and sell them for overseas market, said Qi, vegetable growing has become a major source of income for many of us. According to local sources, the current vegetable growing area makes up one tenth of the county's total arable land. They not only grow traditional varieties such as Chinese cabbages, radish, but also popular vegetables of Japan, the Republic of Korea, France, the Netherlands, and the United States, which sell in a dozen countries in Asia, Europe and America. A county official in charge of agricultural affairs called it a historic leap for farmers to change from simple self-reliance to challenging the international market. This indicates that Chinese farmers have not only become adapted to the market economy, but also started to take aim at the international market, said the official. Vegetables grown by Chinese farmers are brought to the overseas market mainly by foreign trade departments and companies authorized to handle foreign trade. Ruyi Company Group, a company specialized in vegetable exports from Lianyungang, an open port city of east China's Jiangsu Province, has helped local farmers sell their vegetables to foreign countries over the past years. The company group has so far built export vegetable growing bases in 16 provinces, with the total area amounting to 16,667 hectares, where about one million farmers, under the guidance of the company group, are growing quality vegetables needed by the overseas market. An executive told reporters that they are responsible for providing farmers with improved varieties and growing techniques, and are also responsible for purchase, processing, and export of vegetables. The company group exported 30,000 tons of vegetables and earned 20 million U.S. dollars from exports in 1996, according to the executive.

Perhaps it's the French, who have made their sauces a point of national pride and aren't at all shy about telling the rest of the world. Or maybe it's the sauciers, that culinary elite that gives the rest of us the idea that sauces are beyond our reach. Whatever the source of this inferiority complex, the truth is that sauces aren't all that difficult to make.    Consider that most sauces are made of just a very few basic ingredients that most people already have on hand. Butter, flour or other thickening agents, spices and maybe wine are the simple basis for scores of sauces. Yes, there are blending and thickening techniques that you'll have to master, but compared with some other culinary procedures, those are fairly simple.    Nothing can transform the ho-hum into the unforgettable more quickly than a sauce. And to deprive your repertoire of sauces is to miss out on one of the most creative things you can do in the kitchen. Remember, too, that the French haven't cornered the market on sauces. Nearly every nation and region in the world has a signature sauce, making the creative opportunities nearly unlimited.    If you're moved to give up those powder-filled envelopes you've been relying on to jazz up your cooking and are game to enter the creative world of sauces, check out these World Wide Web sites for an informative overview.    &QR;  At www.gumbopages.com/food/sauces/ you will learn, in simple language, about such things as ``mother sauces'' and their derivatives. For example, you'll learn that hollandaise is the mother of bearnaise, maltaise and mousseline. There are easy instructions on thickening techniques and recipes.    &QR;  Other sites at which to learn the basics of sauces and get your vocabulary up to par are ``a compendium of sauces and dips'' at www.flavorweb.com/sauces.htm and a ``glossary of sauces and condiments'' at azstarnet.webpoint.com/food/cksauces.htm    worcestershire.    &QR;  An article by Naomi Cutner at Homearts at food.homearts.com    /cookings/basix/36basa16.htm takes the mystery out of those French sauces by simply explaining the preparation of white sauces, brown sauces, hollandaise, mayonnaise, gravy-type sauces and vinaigrette _ the basic French sauces.    &QR;  At www.cs.cmu.edu/(tilde)mjw/recipes/sauces/index.html you'll find a mind-boggling index of sauces and marinades that will give you an idea of just how many choices you have.

Located on Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Golmud is an emerged city in the Gobi desert in the wake of the development of Qaidam Basin. In the past, it was only a dream of Golmud residents to have fresh vegetable in the long winter-spring seasons. In order to increase vegetable supply, local agronomists started from the period of 1960s-1970s to experiment green-house vegetable growing, which was promoted in a massive way in mid-late 1980s. At present, the city boasts more 267 hectares of vegetable plots plus 27 hectares of vegetable green houses, which are able to turn out a total of 11,000 tons of vegetables, enough to cope with half of the need of the city with a population of 200,000. The other half of the need is met by the supplies of vegetables bought in from elsewhere in China. Vegetable growing has brought fortunes to growers who have come from all over the country. Feng Xiaoming, who settled in Golmud over 20 years ago, told reporters that he and his wife can earn 10,000 yuan (1200 US dollars) from vegetable growing a year. Tan Fubang, who came to Golmud in 1993 practically empty-handed, reclaimed hilly slopes and grew vegetables. Now he has built a three-room house and bought TV set, sofa and other household appliances and furniture. We can buy whatever vegetable we want, a 40-year-old housewife told reporters at a vegetable market.

You are a strict classifier for "commercial uses of marine vegetation".

RELEVANT if all of these hold:

- The document describes a specific commercial application of marine vegetation (e.g., human food, animal feed, pharmaceuticals).
- It identifies the type(s) of marine vegetation involved (e.g., algae species, seaweed varieties, kelp).
- It details processing or utilization steps (e.g., extraction methods, formulation, cultivation practices) or quantifies commercial outcomes (e.g., yield, market value, clinical trial results).

NON-RELEVANT if any of these hold:

- It only discusses ecological roles or environmental benefits of marine vegetation without reference to commercial exploitation.
- It covers wild-harvest biology or taxonomy without linking to commercial uses (food, drugs, fertilizer).
- It focuses on laboratory research on bioactive compounds without any mention of commercial development or market application.
- It describes non-commercial uses (e.g., personal hobby harvesting, cultural practices) without evidence of an industry or business context.

NEGATIVE Example:
Title: "The Role of Kelp Forests in Coastal Ecosystems"

"a taste treasure from davy jones's locker 



   in a world in which ``new'' too often signifies merely a change
in food packaging or processing, nova scotia sea parsley is
floating against the tide. this marine vegetable is an anomaly of
nature, not industry _ though it would not be showing up in stores
now without a little help from human hands.


   sea parsley, a tiny, curly leafed, burgundy-colored seaweed, is
a miniature version of dulse, the red marine plant best known to
diners as an ingredient in seaweed salads in japanese restaurants.
it is a natural mutation, discovered in 1978 by a group of
scientists off grand manan island in the bay of fundy, near the
coast of maine.


   the scientists formed a company, ocean produce international, to
cultivate the seaweed in saltwater tanks and sell it.


   until a few months ago, this delicacy was known only to japanese
and other asian cooks, as well as vegetarians, who bought it
directly from the company. but now it is being sold, in one-ounce
packages, for about $5 at specialty groceries in new york. it is
also available by mail order from adriana's caravan, (800)
316-0820.


   it did not take long for chefs to be captivated by this new
ingredient, which smells like the ocean but whose taste changes,
depending on how it is used.


   rick moonen, the executive chef of oceana, said that sea parsley
``seems to have a natural affinity to asian ingredients, but also
classic french preparations, like consomme.'' he adds it to seafood
soups or stews or to the pot when steaming a fish. the seaweed
lends a briny yet clean flavor.


   as a canadian product, sea parsley often turns up on the menu at
the canadian consulate in new york, where louis charest, the
executive chef, has been using it for a year or so. he chops it and
adds it to salads, as he would arugula. he also uses it to flavor
salmon, sturgeon and turbot dishes; buries a fish in it for
steaming, and includes it in a warm lobster salad.


   sea parsley, like most seaweed, is packed with vitamins and
calcium, and contains amino acids, which break down food fibers and
permeate them, changing their texture. if sea parsley is used raw
or barely cooked, the changes are subtle. if simmered or broiled
with other ingredients, however, it tenderizes them and alters
their taste.


   what chefs have discovered about this chameleon of a vegetable
is that when it is fresh and raw, it has a mild nutty taste with
hints of oyster and lots of crunch. when fried, it becomes a golden
green color and very crisp, and tastes more like bacon.


   boiled sea parsley becomes deep green and takes on a mussel-like
taste. sun dried, it has a roasted vegetable flavor. fresh out of a
microwave oven, it tastes more like nori and is great when mixed
with a little rice vinegar.


   so go ahead and do what the chefs do _ experiment. fry some sea
parsley and sprinkle it like croutons on a salad, particularly a
salad accompanying cold or smoked seafood, or use it as a garnish
for seafood or vegetable dishes or as an accompaniment to smoked
fish, sushi and sashimi.


   for a wonderful blast of the ocean, add it to broths for
poaching or steaming. when boiled in lightly salted water for 15
minutes, sea parsley produces a broth that tastes like clam and
oyster juices _ a good base for a chowder or a quick seafood stew.


   visually, it may take some imagination to recognize the
similarities between surf parsley and the more familiar turf
parsley. but just as curly or flat leaf parsley gives a dish a
whiff of the garden, its marine counterpart bespeaks the mysterious
flavors of the deep.


   sea parsley salad with rice wine vinaigrette


   time: 40 minutes


   for the dressing:


   2 teaspoons sesame oil


   3 tablespoons vegetable oil


   { shallot, minced


   4 teaspoons rice wine vinegar


   2 teaspoons lemon juice


   1 tablespoon soy sauce.


   for the salad:


   one-third cup vegetable oil


   4 cups (about 3 ounces) sea parsley


   3 carrots, peeled and finely julienned


   1{ cups peeled and finely julienned jicama
