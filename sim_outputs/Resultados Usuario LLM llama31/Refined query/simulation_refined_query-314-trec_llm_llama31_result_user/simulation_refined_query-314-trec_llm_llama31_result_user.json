  "topic": "Marine Vegetation\n\nCommercial harvesting of marine vegetation such as algae, seaweed and kelp for food and drug purposes.  \n\nRecent research has shown that marine vegetation is a valuable source of both food (human and animal) and a potentially useful drug.  This search will focus primarily on these two uses.  Also to be considered relevant would be instances of other possible commercial uses such as fertilizer, etc.\n\n\nYou are a strict classifier for \"commercial uses of marine vegetation\".\n\nRELEVANT if all of these hold:\n\n- The document describes a specific commercial application of marine vegetation (e.g., human food, animal feed, pharmaceuticals).\n- It identifies the type(s) of marine vegetation involved (e.g., algae species, seaweed varieties, kelp).\n- It details processing or utilization steps (e.g., extraction methods, formulation, cultivation practices) or quantifies commercial outcomes (e.g., yield, market value, clinical trial results).\n\nNON-RELEVANT if any of these hold:\n\n- It only discusses ecological roles or environmental benefits of marine vegetation without reference to commercial exploitation.\n- It covers wild-harvest biology or taxonomy without linking to commercial uses (food, drugs, fertilizer).\n- It focuses on laboratory research on bioactive compounds without any mention of commercial development or market application.\n- It describes non-commercial uses (e.g., personal hobby harvesting, cultural practices) without evidence of an industry or business context.\n\nNEGATIVE Example:\nTitle: \"The Role of Kelp Forests in Coastal Ecosystems\"\nrelevant: false\njustification: \"Ecological study, no commercial harvesting or applications.\"\n\nPOSITIVE Example:\nTitle: \"Seaweed Extracts from Laminaria japonica Developed into Animal Feed Supplements\"\nrelevant: true\njustification: \"Marine vegetation: Laminaria japonica; Commercial use: animal feed; Details: extraction process and feed trial outcomes.\"",

      "content": "&HT;   \n\n\n\n   I am sitting in a restaurant in the North Carolina mountains,\nlooking at the menu. One of the offerings is something called\nmarinated and grilled pork tenderloin with rosemary-Zinfandel\nsauce, goat cheese-chive mash and Carolyn's fresh-picked snap\nbeans, whomever Carolyn the bean-picker might be.\n\n\n   As I am not big on goat cheese-chive mash, my choice, instead,\nis the marinated and grilled leg of lamb with mint aioli, vegetable\nmarmalade and Tuscan beans. Although I had no idea what ``aioli''\nwas, it just sounded better than the goat cheese-chive mash.\n\n\n   Passed up, also, was the too adventurous-sounding\nchocolate-infused espresso-crusted grilled tenderloin of beef with\nIrish cream sauce, French beans and goat cheese-au gratin potatoes.\nI thought to myself that if I wanted coffee with dinner, I'd order\nit in a cup instead of ``infused'' in a piece of beef.\n\n\n   When my plate arrives, I look down at it, then across to my wife\nwith my best ``is-that-all-there-is?'' look. She has problems of\nher own. Her citrus-soy marinated rare grilled yellowfin tuna with\njasmine rice, stir-fried vegetables and a variety of sauces more\ncommon to Japanese restaurants seems to still be flapping. This is\none big piece of sushi.\n\n\n   She sends it back so that the cook may kill and warm it.\n\n\n   What I'm looking at on my plate are circular-placed,\nquarter-sized, thin pieces of lamb; six in all. I could get all six\npieces into one mouthful. Between them are curious-looking dollops\nof a light green substance that is identified to me as the aioli\nand further defined as mayonnaise flavored with crushed garlic;\ninfused, I am certain.\n\n\n   The rest of the entree has this hockey puck-looking disk of\nbeans glued together by the vegetable marmalade.\n\n\n   It is then that my wife and I fondly begin discussing the dinner\nwe had a couple of nights earlier in South Carolina _ a tangy,\nfilling platter of Memphis-style ribs, baked potato and salad. Note\nthat each and all of these ingredients are identifiable to the\naverage American.\n\n\n   It would seem that in these recent decades of chi-chi American\ngastronomy, presumably foisted upon us by California chefs run\namok, there are becoming just two types of restaurant dining: fast\nfood and no food. What's in-between is fading from the restaurant\nplatter.\n\n\n   Try going to one of those restaurants where the kitchen is out\nin the open, the chefs considered to be celebrities, and try to get\nsome meatloaf. Fat chance!\n\n\n   I left the restaurant for my room, still hungry and longing for\nthat jar of peanuts on my nightstand and a cold Dr Pepper.\n\n\n   The experience of enigmatic and paltry main courses reminded me\nof a column written by a now-gone colleague who tired of the trend\nto fantasy-style dining. He showed up at a 7-Eleven one night, and\nforaged the food cabinets of the establishment. ``First, I munched\non an adventurous pemmican appetizer called a Super Jerk Slim\nJim,'' John Keasler wrote. ``It sent my taste buds right into happy\nlittle aerobics!\n\n\n   ``The main course,'' he continued, ``is prepared by a system of\nmicro (or little-ditty) waves. My companion was overjoyed with her\nRed Hot Beef and Bean Burro, an astounding bargain at 79 cents,\nwhile I literally drooled over my Shredded Beef Chimichanga With\nGreen Chili and Cheese in a Fried Flour Tortilla, at the same\nprice.''\n\n\n   So, that seems to be our choice: aioli, chocolate-infused\nespresso-crusted something, goat cheese-chive mash on one side and\nribs, hamburgers and a plain old steak or fried catfish on the\nother.\n\n\n   No one ever had to explain a menu to me at Denny's, or even\nShoney's.\n\n\n   But that's what's so great about this country, eh?; the choice.\n\n\n   (Howard Kleinberg, a former editor of the Miami News, is a\ncolumnist for Cox Newspapers.

They suit today's lifestyles\nbecause they're usually easy to make and don't require cooking\nexpertise. They're perfect for little meals or finger-food snacks\nwith drinks. Tapas (pronounced TOP-ahs), translated ``lids on\ntop,'' are appetizers _ the Spanish equivalent of French hors\nd'oeuvres and Mexican bocas (short for ``bocados,'' meaning\nmouthfuls or bites).\n\n\n   It's the second time around for tapas. Although some Houston\nrestaurants have offered tapas for about 20 years, they enjoyed a\nbrief fad in the '80s, then faded.\n\n\n   Tapas went the way of fondue and crepes until the '90s, when\nrestaurants introduced Houstonians to South American-style tidbits.\n\n\n   Restaurants concerned with authenticity have an education job on\ntheir hands. Some classic Spanish ingredients are an acquired\ntaste, particularly smelt, salt cod, baby eel (angula), squid\n(calamare), snails, octopus, baby anchovies (boquerones), chorizo\nsausage, blood sausage (morcilla) and salty-cured Serrano ham.\n\n\n   Shrimp, mussels, a variety of olives, bowls of almonds, fresh\npimentos and Spanish Tortilla (potato omelet) receive more instant\nacceptance.\n\n\n   Penelope Casas has written several books on Spain. In her books,\nshe offers a wealth of tips on tapas, including the following:\n\n\n   Choose a variety of tapas _ vegetables, meats, seafood. Prepare\none or several from each category: fried, baked or grilled; cold or\nmarinated; in sauces; or with bread or pastries.\n\n\n   For a large group, choose finger foods or serve tapas on\ntoothpicks. Make 10 to 20 different tapa varieties and set them out\nbuffet-style.\n\n\n   Tapas that need last-minute preparation and should be eaten\nimmediately, should be spaced over the course of the evening and\npassed on trays.\n\n\n   For a small gathering, start with lighter tapas, such as\nrice-filled pimentos or seafood-stuffed mushrooms, and progress to\nmore filling tapas.\n\n\n   Serve tapas with sherry (well-chilled fino sherry is\ntraditional), especially if tapas are spicy or salty. Serve with\nthe appropriate white or red wine, beer or sangria.\n\n\n   Among popular tapas with drinks are croquettes (made with\npotatoes or seafood), grilled vegetables with garlic sauce,\nPotatoes Bravas (spicy potatoes), cheese (Mi Luna offers a platter\nwith goat cheese, Brie and manchego tossed in olive oil that has\nbeen infused with peppercorns, chervil and lemon), marinated olives\nand mushrooms. &QL; \n &QL; \nXXXXXEND OF STORY &QL;",

If you're in your 40s or 50s, you're way\nbehind schedule if you haven't had it checked recently. All it\ntakes is a quick blood test.\n\n\n   If your numbers are low, you know you're doing something right;\nif they're high, you and your physician can take action.\n\n\n   High cholesterol is one of the major risk factors for heart\ndisease, although it's far from the only one.

Knowing your total blood cholesterol level is important in\ndetermining your risk for heart disease. If you have high\ncholesterol, you're not alone. Nearly 97 million Americans have\nlevels that are borderline-high or high. Cholesterol levels are\ngraded on this scale:\n\n\n   Less than 200 mg/dL is desirable\n\n\n   200 to 239 mg/dL is borderline-high\n\n\n   240 mg/dL and up is high\n\n\n   WHO SHOULD HAVE THEIR HIS OR HER CHOLESTEROL TESTED?\n\n\n   In general, adults who are older than 20 should have their\ncholesterol levels tested every five years, according to the\nAmerican Heart Association. You may need to be tested more\nfrequently depending on your health history and family history.\n\n\n   WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ``GOOD'' AND ``BAD'' CHOLESTEROL?\n\n\n   The ``good'' cholesterol is HDL-C, high-density lipoprotein\ncholesterol. HDL-C is thought to aid in the removal of excess\ncholesterol from the blood. High levels of HDL-C are associated\nwith a decreased risk of heart attack. Your HDL-C level should be\n35 mg/dL or higher.\n\n\n   ``Bad'' cholesterol is LDL-C, or low-density lipoprotein\ncholesterol. Too much LDL-C in your blood can stick to the walls of\nyour arteries, narrowing them and reducing their ability to\ntransport blood. In people without heart disease, the LDL-C level\nshould be lower than 130 mg/dL.\n\n\n   Here's an easy way to remember the difference. L stands for\nlife-threatening or LDL cholesterol, and H stands for healthy or\nHDL-C. Ask what your levels of each one are.\n\n\n   HOW CAN I LOWER MY CHOLESTEROL?\n\n\n   The American Heart Association's most important piece of advice\nis: Watch what you eat. To help lower your cholesterol, eat five or\nmore servings of fruits and vegetables each day. Eat a wide variety\nof foods low in saturated fat and cholesterol.\n\n\n   You also should exercise. Aerobic activities such as dancing,\nbrisk walking, jogging, biking or swimming will help. Activity that\nincreases your heart rate for 30 or 60 minutes or longer each day\nis best.

      "content": "No, they are not prize fighters, but comeback kids who strut\ntheir stuff in the bins of farmers' markets and some food-forward\ngrocery stores.\n\n\n   Not too many years ago, these heirloom tomatoes seemed doomed,\npushed toward oblivion by generally picked-while-green hybrid\nRomas, hydroponically grown cluster tomatoes and a few other\nvarieties of great uniformity, near-indestructibility and, for the\nmost part, insipid flavor.\n\n\n   A few intrepid gardeners/conservationists tried to keep the old\nvarieties alive, growing them in backyard plots and swapping seeds\nwith like-minded tomato lovers. And they managed _ largely via\nfarmers' markets _ to popularize these tomatoes that range from\ntiny cherries to whopping two-pounders and from green and yellow to\nrust and the hue of old Bordeaux wine.\n\n\n   Janet Brown is one of these tradition-minded growers who has\nparlayed a personal passion into a viable business. She now grows\n30 varieties of heirloom tomatoes on her small family farm, AllStar\nOrganics in Lagunitas (Marin County).\n\n\n   Brown has less than three acres under cultivation, but she grows\nenough to supply a number of high-end restaurants, natural food\nstores and central Marin's upscale grocery, Woodland Market in\nRoss.\n\n\n   Brown's farming career began _ depending on how you care to look\nat it _ either with a disaster or with serendipity.\n\n\n   Eight years ago, the software development company for which she\nworked went belly-up. Having gardened all her life, the Long Beach\nnative who had lived and owned land in Marin for more than two\ndecades, decided to say farewell to the corporate routine. ``I took\na little risk,'' she admits of her move into for-profit organic\ngardening and food advocacy, ``But I didn't have much to lose. I\ncould always go back.''\n\n\n   The valley where she lives with her husband, Marty Jacobson, is\nringed by trees and has its own microclimate.

      "content": "A TASTE TREASURE FROM DAVY JONES'S LOCKER \n\n\n\n   In a world in which ``new'' too often signifies merely a change\nin food packaging or processing, Nova Scotia sea parsley is\nfloating against the tide. This marine vegetable is an anomaly of\nnature, not industry _ though it would not be showing up in stores\nnow without a little help from human hands.\n\n\n   Sea parsley, a tiny, curly leafed, burgundy-colored seaweed, is\na miniature version of dulse, the red marine plant best known to\ndiners as an ingredient in seaweed salads in Japanese restaurants.\nIt is a natural mutation, discovered in 1978 by a group of\nscientists off Grand Manan Island in the Bay of Fundy, near the\ncoast of Maine.\n\n\n   The scientists formed a company, Ocean Produce International, to\ncultivate the seaweed in saltwater tanks and sell it.\n\n\n   Until a few months ago, this delicacy was known only to Japanese\nand other Asian cooks, as well as vegetarians, who bought it\ndirectly from the company. But now it is being sold, in one-ounce\npackages, for about $5 at specialty groceries in New York. It is\nalso available by mail order from Adriana's Caravan, (800)\n316-0820.\n\n\n   It did not take long for chefs to be captivated by this new\ningredient, which smells like the ocean but whose taste changes,\ndepending on how it is used.\n\n\n   Rick Moonen, the executive chef of Oceana, said that sea parsley\n``seems to have a natural affinity to Asian ingredients, but also\nclassic French preparations, like consomme.'' He adds it to seafood\nsoups or stews or to the pot when steaming a fish. The seaweed\nlends a briny yet clean flavor.\n\n\n   As a Canadian product, sea parsley often turns up on the menu at\nthe Canadian Consulate in New York, where Louis Charest, the\nexecutive chef, has been using it for a year or so. He chops it and\nadds it to salads, as he would arugula. He also uses it to flavor\nsalmon, sturgeon and turbot dishes; buries a fish in it for\nsteaming, and includes it in a warm lobster salad.\n\n\n   Sea parsley, like most seaweed, is packed with vitamins and\ncalcium, and contains amino acids, which break down food fibers and\npermeate them, changing their texture. If sea parsley is used raw\nor barely cooked, the changes are subtle. If simmered or broiled\nwith other ingredients, however, it tenderizes them and alters\ntheir taste.\n\n\n   What chefs have discovered about this chameleon of a vegetable\nis that when it is fresh and raw, it has a mild nutty taste with\nhints of oyster and lots of crunch. When fried, it becomes a golden\ngreen color and very crisp, and tastes more like bacon.\n\n\n   Boiled sea parsley becomes deep green and takes on a mussel-like\ntaste. Sun dried, it has a roasted vegetable flavor. Fresh out of a\nmicrowave oven, it tastes more like nori and is great when mixed\nwith a little rice vinegar.\n\n\n   So go ahead and do what the chefs do _ experiment. Fry some sea\nparsley and sprinkle it like croutons on a salad, particularly a\nsalad accompanying cold or smoked seafood, or use it as a garnish\nfor seafood or vegetable dishes or as an accompaniment to smoked\nfish, sushi and sashimi.\n\n\n   For a wonderful blast of the ocean, add it to broths for\npoaching or steaming. When boiled in lightly salted water for 15\nminutes, sea parsley produces a broth that tastes like clam and\noyster juices _ a good base for a chowder or a quick seafood stew.\n\n\n   Visually, it may take some imagination to recognize the\nsimilarities between surf parsley and the more familiar turf\nparsley. But just as curly or flat leaf parsley gives a dish a\nwhiff of the garden, its marine counterpart bespeaks the mysterious\nflavors of the deep.\n\n\n   SEA PARSLEY SALAD WITH RICE WINE VINAIGRETTE\n\n\n   Time: 40 minutes\n\n\n   For the dressing:\n\n\n   2 teaspoons sesame oil\n\n\n   3 tablespoons vegetable oil\n\n\n   { shallot, minced\n\n\n   4 teaspoons rice wine vinegar\n\n\n   2 teaspoons lemon juice\n\n\n   1 tablespoon soy sauce.\n\n\n   For the salad:\n\n\n   One-third cup vegetable oil\n\n\n   4 cups (about 3 ounces) sea parsley\n\n\n   3 carrots, peeled and finely julienned\n\n\n   1{ cups peeled and finely julienned jicama\n\n\n   2",

      "content": "VEGGIE OUT WITH CURTIS\n\n\n\n   With unrestrained enthusiasm and a smile wider than the\nChattahoochee River, Curtis Aikens makes his success look like\nchild's play.\n\n\n   The burly, vegetarian star of the cable TV Food Network's ``Pick\nof the Day'' has an irresistible sweetness that could make even the\nmost dedicated meat-and-potatoes eater want to gobble a plate of\ngrilled tofu.\n\n\n   All that positive energy is exactly what Aikens used to mask a\ndark secret for more than 20 years.\n\n\n   ``I'm the first African-American to have a cooking show on TV,\nyet I didn't learn to read until I was 26,'' Aikens, 40, said\nduring a brief break in a whirlwind Fort Worth weekend.\n\n\n   ``Sharing with kids is what's so important that you achieve\nthings by reaching for them,'' Aikens said. ``I tell the kids to\nset goals, to strive to be better and to give back.''\n\n\n   Wherever he goes to do personal appearances, either cooking for\na charity event or publicizing his latest cookbook, Aikens finds an\noutlet for spreading his literacy gospel and talking to children\nabout overcoming odds.\n\n\n   Aikens was born in Conyers, Ga., just east of Atlanta. He said\nhe didn't suffer from dyslexia but just wasn't taught properly. He\nrepeated the third grade and just ``schmoozed'' his way through the\nrest of school.\n\n\n   ``It was exhausting,'' he said. ``I wish someone had been as\nopen to me about asking for help as I try to be when I'm talking to\nkids.''\n\n\n   He practices what he preaches about giving back: All royalties\nfrom his cookbooks _ the latest of three is 1995's ``Curtis Cooks\nWith Heart and Soul'' (William Morris, $23) _ go to reading and\nliteracy programs, he said.\n\n\n   Aikens was 26 and running his own produce business in the San\nFrancisco area when he saw a TV commercial for a literacy program.\nIt promised confidentiality, and Aikens got the tutoring he\ndesperately needed.\n\n\n   Drawing on the passion that his mother, Laura, has for cooking,\nAikens turned his love of vegetables and food preparation into a\nhigh-profile career. He made his mother's pumpkin pie first when he\nlaunched his TV cooking show in Atlanta in 1989.\n\n\n   ``Mama taught me to cook; she's my big inspiration. There's\nnothing like her collard greens and corn bread,'' he said. ``She's\nproud of me, and I'm proud of her, too.''\n\n\n   Soon he was the produce man on ABC-TV's ``Home Show,'' and his\nfirst cookbook was published in 1990.\n\n\n   His vegetarian theme has had staying power. Originally, he\nsought a meat-free diet to lose weight but wound up sticking with\nit because ``vegetables eat and taste good.''\n\n\n   ``I'm not anti-meat. I just grew up loving and eating\nvegetables,'' he said. ``Our family always believed that vegetables\nare as big a part of the meal as meat.''\n\n\n   What's his favorite vegetable? Whatever's fresh. Aikens enjoys\nsauteing veggies in a tiny bit of olive oil and adding a bit of a\nfavorite salad dressing or some marinara for serving. Or he'll\ngrill asparagus, potatoes and any other vegetables that are handy.\n\n\n   ``Most people have no idea how easy this is,'' he said. ``You\nsaute the vegetables a few minutes, cook some pasta and in 10\nminutes, it's on the table.''\n\n\n   When he's feeling nostalgic, his favorite dish to make is\ncollard greens, cooked with an onion, sliced bell pepper, garlic, a\nbit of olive oil and salt. He's happy to report, too, that he can\nnow find decent collard greens in California.\n\n\n   ``Okra is one of my real favorites, but the Southern kind is\nhard to get in California. The okra we get there from Chile just\nisn't the same,'' he said.\n\n\n   That's important because Aikens splits his time _ when he's not\ntaping the TV show in New York _ between homes in Georgia and in\nMarin County, where his two young sons live, north of San\nFrancisco.\n\n\n   Travels will soon take Aikens on his first trip to Great\nBritain. That's where he'll be working on a new international\nliteracy program with suspense novelist Ken Follett, whom he met\nrecently through mutual friend Robin Leach while vacationing in\nAntigua.

      "content": "A TWO-DAY MARINADE GIVES ZEST TO SEA BASS \n\n\n\n   If cooking is as much alchemy as chemistry, here is the dish to\nprove it: Chilean sea bass metamorphosed by a two-day submersion in\na miso marinade, then broiled until it is as brown and shiny as a\nperfectly barbecued rib.\n\n\n   Two days is a long time to marinate anything, particularly fish,\nbut it takes that long for the marinade to work its magic. It is a\nblend of orange juice and zest, brown sugar, sake, a light miso\npaste and the pungent chili paste called sambal oelek.\n\n\n   Chilean sea bass, which is actually Patagonian tooth fish,\nstarts out as what I call a Jell-O fish: its flesh is soft, wet and\noily. Steam it and its texture will remind you of soft-boiled eggs.\nBut cover it with the marinade and all that changes, strikingly.\n\n\n   The marinade's salts and sugars act as a cure and turn the soft\nfish into one that flakes in large, firm shards. Marinated, the\nChilean sea bass comes to resemble cod, but creamier and richer.\n\n\n   And after two days, it is not just the texture that changes. The\nfish is imbued with the salty, sweet, bitter, acidic flavors,\ncomplexity and exotic richness of the marinade's ingredients, many\nof them rooted in the traditional cooking of Japan, and all of them\nintensified when the fish is cooked.\n\n\n   I top the glazed fillets with cilantro leaves and surround them\nwith a salad of mango and scallion greens splashed with a citrusy\ndressing, an integral part of the dish.\n\n\n   The fish calls for the coolness and sharpness of the salad and\nits dressing, whose flavors are haunting but immediately appealing.\nThe crisp citrus taste in the dressing comes from the\ncitrus-flavored soy sauce called ajipon, and from yuzu kosho, a\nchili paste that includes yuzu, a Japanese citrus fruit prized for\nthe oils in its skin. To pull the flavors into balance, I add\nmirin, a sweet Japanese rice wine, and rice wine vinegar.\n\n\n   You may have to make a few shopping trips to collect the\ningredients for this dish, but I promise you they will be worth\nit. &QL; \n &QL;\n\n\n   MISO-GLAZED CHILEAN SEA BASS &QL;\n\n\n   Time: 40 minutes, plus 2 days for marinating the fillets &QL; \n &QL;\n\n\n   2 oranges\n\n\n   1 cup freshly squeezed orange juice\n\n\n   { cup light-brown sugar\n\n\n   } cup sake\n\n\n   1\\ cups light miso paste (see note)\n\n\n   1 tablespoon sambal oelek chili paste (see note)\n\n\n   6 skinless fillets of Chilean sea bass, each about 7 ounces\n\n\n   \\ cup ajipon (see note)\n\n\n   \\ cup mirin (see note)\n\n\n   \\ cup seasoned rice vinegar\n\n\n   \\ cup soybean oil\n\n\n   1 teaspoon yuzu kosho (see note)\n\n\n   1 tablespoon vegetable oil\n\n\n   2 carrots, peeled and finely shredded\n\n\n   { daikon, peeled and finely shredded\n\n\n   2 teaspoons soy sauce\n\n\n   1 ripe mango, peeled, pitted and cut into short, thin strips\n\n\n   3 scallions, green parts only, thinly sliced diagonally\n\n\n   6 sprigs cilantro, leaves only. &QL; \n &QL;\n\n\n   1.

      "content": "TEA? TURMERIC? THE QUEST FOR SAFER BARBECUE\n\n\n\n   The height of the barbecue season is not when anyone wants to\nhear about the hazards of eating meat with a nicely blackened crust\nhot off the grill. But scientists have long known that substances\ncreated when meat and poultry are cooked at high heat can cause\ncancer in animals and that there is some evidence that they may\nhave the same effect on humans.\n\n\n   While health professionals still recommend cutting back on\noverall meat consumption, recent research suggests that there are\nmore appealing ways to make grilled meat less hazardous. Some are\ncommon-sensical, like eating it rare (though this is not\nrecommended for chicken or hamburger) or medium instead of well\ndone, or cooking it at lower temperatures for shorter periods. But\nothers are more startling, like sprinkling meat with tea powder, or\nmixing ground meat with cherries, or just marinating meat before\ncooking.\n\n\n   Clearly, scientists are now so aware of the potential risks that\nthey are looking into every corner of the kitchen for solutions.\nBut their research is in its earliest stages, so they are not\nreally sure how or why some of these techniques work.\n\n\n   ``It's hard for scientists to say we don't know,'' said Dr. Mark\nG. Knize, a member of the Biology and Biotechnology Research\nProgram at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in Livermore,\nCalif., who is conducting some of the research on the effects of\nmarinades.\n\n\n   For whatever reason, though, he and other scientists have found\nthat one of the most promising techniques for meat and poultry is\nmarination. Done even briefly, it reduces the cancer-causing\ncompounds called heterocyclic amines, or HCA's, formed when\ncreatine in muscle meats reacts with amino acids at high\ntemperatures. (Fish is much less a problem than meat or poultry.)\nBut marination does nothing to reduce the level of other\ncarcinogens that arise when fat falls on a fire and causes smoke.\n\n\n   Scientists have not yet deconstructed all their marinade\ningredients to pinpoint the anti-cancer agents. They suspect that\nthe antioxidants in certain foods like garlic, onions, chives,\nturmeric, thyme, rosemary and oregano, as well as vitamins C and E,\nare responsible.\n\n\n   In studies last year at the Cancer Research Center of Hawaii in\nHonolulu, three different sauces were used to marinate steaks\novernight. One was a teriyaki sauce, another contained turmeric and\ngarlic powder and the third was a commercial sauce made of honey,\nhigh-fructose corn syrup, vinegar, concentrated tomato juice,\nmodified food starch, salt and seasonings. Four-ounce pieces of\nmarinated and unmarinated steak were cooked on a propane gas grill\nfor varying times at varying temperatures. The marinades were not\nreapplied during cooking.\n\n\n   The shorter the cooking time and the lower the heat, the lower\nthe levels of the suspect amines in meats marinated in the teriyaki\nand turmeric sauces, compared with unmarinated meat. Steaks\nmarinated in the commercial sauce and cooked similarly had much\nhigher levels of the amines than the other marinated meats; the\nresearchers said this may have been partly because the corn syrup\nand honey caused the steaks to burn and char faster and more\nextensively.\n\n\n   I conducted taste tests on the teriyaki and turmeric sauces. The\nturmeric marinade adds flavor to tender but otherwise tasteless\nsteak, while the teriyaki makes meat slightly sweet, although the\nbrown sugar it contains causes the meat to burn faster.\n\n\n   In a 1997 study at Lawrence Livermore, researchers marinated\nchicken breasts in a mixture including garlic, salt, citrus juice\nand olive oil that also contained considerable sugar, and they\nconcluded that the sugar was probably responsible for an increase\nin one of the amines. Using sweet commercial barbecue sauces may be\njust the wrong thing.\n\n\n   Other researchers are looking into other antidotes. Dr. John\nWeisburger, director emeritus of the nonprofit American Health\nFoundation in New York, has done studies indicating that sprinkling\ntea powder, either green or black, on m",

      "content": "IMPROVISING A SALAD FROM THE GARDEN \n\n\n\n   NEW YORK _ When I was the chef at Greens, the vegetarian\nrestaurant in San Francisco, we were affiliated with Green Gulch\nFarm, which was just across the Golden Gate Bridge, in Marin\nCounty. I lived at the farm and worked closely with the head\ngardener, and together we found and grew unusual seeds. As a\nresult, we were able to serve all kinds of exotic vegetables at the\nrestaurant. Although today it's expected that a restaurant of any\nstature will be working with farmers or even have its own farm, in\n1979 this was not the case.\n\n\n   After driving the crates of produce across the bridge to the\nrestaurant, more often than not I found that I had nothing in\nenough quantity to feature by itself. So one of my menu standards\nwas what we called Farm Salad _ a composed salad of raw, steamed,\npickled and grilled vegetables, with a few sauces, usually\naccompanied by a wedge of frittata or some hard-cooked eggs, also\nfrom the farm. By necessity, these salads were ever-changing, but\nall presented a variety of tastes and textures.\n\n\n   Now, I choose vegetables from the farmers' market and my small\ngarden, and I've vastly simplified the number of ingredients and\nthe method, using just one dressing for everything. I steam or\nparboil most of the vegetables, but there is certainly room for raw\nvegetables, grilled peppers or onions, and pickled vegetables or\nolives. This dish allows you to improvise based on what's around\nand how much you want to do.\n\n\n   These days, I like a pestolike dressing based on fresh, fragrant\nmarjoram. Like basil, marjoram is widely used in Liguria, the\nregion around the Italian Riviera. Marjoram has a wonderful,\npowerful flavor, and it's tied together here with other typical\ningredients, like capers, pine nuts and olives, in a sauce akin to\none used in the Ligurian salad called cappon magro, which is\nusually composed of a variety of fish and vegetables. (If you want\nto add cold steamed or grilled fish to the farm salad, it's\nperfectly appropriate.) I find it difficult to avoid eating this\ndelicious sauce with a spoon or spreading it on bread.\n\n\n   Although the sauce recipe below is fairly precise, the vegetable\nsuggestions are just that: suggestions. If you figure at least 12\nounces of vegetables a person, along with a little protein _ in the\nform of hard-boiled egg, fish or a combination _ the meal will work\nout fine.\n\n\n   FARM SALAD WITH MARJORAM SAUCE\n\n\n   Time: about 1 hour\n\n\n   4 medium beets, or more small ones\n\n\n   12 small new potatoes\n\n\n   1 pound green beans, trimmed\n\n\n   4 to 8 small carrots, peeled\n\n\n   2 red onions, peeled and cut into half-inch rounds\n\n\n   2 small zucchini, cut in half lengthwise\n\n\n   { cup plus 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil\n\n\n   1 {-inch-thick slice good white bread, crusts trimmed\n\n\n   2 tablespoons red wine vinegar\n\n\n   1 teaspoon minced garlic\n\n\n   2 tablespoons marjoram leaves\n\n\n   3 tablespoons drained capers\n\n\n   { cup pine nuts\n\n\n   1 cup finely minced parsley leaves\n\n\n   2 tablespoons pitted olives, like nicoise\n\n\n   Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste\n\n\n   12 radishes, trimmed\n\n\n   4 to 8 pickled artichoke hearts (canned are fine)\n\n\n   1 medium cucumber, trimmed and cut into eighths\n\n\n   4 hard-cooked eggs, cut in half.\n\n\n   1.

Take\ngrapefruit juice with cyclosporin, a drug that fights organ\nrejection in transplant patients, and it may cause confusion and\ntrembling.\n\n\n   Those potential interactions are getting more attention these\ndays as the number of Americans taking prescription medicines\ncontinues to increase. Most side effects aren't so dramatic: upset\nstomach, diarrhea, fatigue and irritability.\n\n\n   ``Approximately 85 million American adults take one or more\nprescription medicines,'' said Linda Golodner, president of the\nNational Consumers League, an advocacy group in Washington, D.C.\n``Yet despite this widespread use, many consumers do not know about\npotential risks, side effects and possible drug interactions.''\n\n\n   The problem has been compounded in recent years with the advance\nof newer medicines, many of which have subtle effects on different\nenzyme systems in the body.\n\n\n   In addition, many medical conditions, including the AIDS virus,\nrequire patients to follow a complex and difficult prescription\nregimen with some drugs taken on an empty stomach, others taken\nwith food, to ensure best results.\n\n\n   ``It can be very difficult depending on what regimen they're on\nto know when to take them,'' said Bonnie Purdy, a clinical\npharmacist at the Albany Medical Center. ``Some drugs if you take\nthem with food, absorption is closer to 90 percent. If you take\nthem on an empty stomach, absorption is closer to 40 percent.''\n\n\n   To increase awareness about potential problems, the National\nConsumers League, in cooperation with the Food and Drug\nAdministration, has recently published a brochure to alert\nconsumers to possible food-drug interactions for some of the most\ncommon prescription medicines.\n\n\n   To date, the consumers league has received about 120,000\nrequests from across the country for the brochure, which includes\ninformation on how to take everything from antibiotics to\nanti-anxiety drugs.\n\n\n   These are some of the recommendations:\n\n\n   _ Take penicillin and amoxicillin on an empty stomach, unless it\ncauses upset, in which take them with food.\n\n\n   _ For Cipro, Levaquin, Floxin and Trovan, other antibiotics, the\nkey is to avoid calcium-containing products such as milk, yogurt,\nantacids and any iron-containing vitamins and minerals. Such foods\nand vitamins significantly decrease drug absorption.\n\n\n   _ With the anti-anxiety drugs Xanax or Valium, be aware that\ncaffeine may cause excitability, nervousness and hyperactivity.\n\n\n   _ Avoid eating foods high in the chemical tyramine, such as\ncheese and sausage, if you are taking antidepressants known as\nmonoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors. The mix can cause a potentially\nfatal rise in blood pressure.\n\n\n   Health experts welcome the National Consumers League's effort,\nbut emphasize that the best defense against any harmful food-drug\ncombination is open and frequent communication among patients,\ndoctors and pharmacists.\n\n\n   ``Everyone should perform as a team,'' said Kathleen M.

But not everyone knows\nwhat to do when confronted by silverware, napkin, fresh bread, salt\nand pepper _ and a bottle of olive oil.\n\n\n   You try to figure why there is no butter on the table, and what\nyou are supposed to do with the oil?\n\n\n   Hey, it's easy. Just pour the oil on your bread. If you get a\nsmall saucer, pour the oil on the saucer and dip your bread. Pour\ndirectly or dip. Either way is OK. If there is one plate of oil for\nthe whole table, just share, family-style, politely.\n\n\n   More and more restaurants, especially Italian ones, are adopting\nthe Mediterranean tableau, serving olive oil as a regular\ncondiment, leaving the butter in the kitchen.\n\n\n   If you have to have bread and butter too, don't hesitate to ask.\nIn most restaurants, the customer is always right.\n\n\n   But when the oil is there, consider pouring it on your bread, or\ndrizzling on top of a hearty vegetable soup or grilled vegetables.\n\n\n   Restaurateur Michael Hirschberg remembers shocking his staff 10\nyears ago when he said he wanted to put olive oil instead of butter\nat the table at his Ristorante Siena.\n\n\n   ``The waiters reacted in horror. I might have said we are going\nto put rat poison on the table,'' Hirschberg said.\n\n\n   Now that restaurant is Mistral and there still is olive oil,\nwith a pour spout, at every table. Mistral serves 100 lunches a\nday, and gets maybe one or two requests for butter.\n\n\n   ``People seem to understand. Some people pour it on to the\nbread, others on the plate and dip. I don't know if there is a\nproper way,'' Hirschberg said.\n\n\n   Marin County olive oil maven Nan McEvoy pours her signature oil\ninto soup and onto fresh bread. Healdsburg olive oil producer\nRidgley Evers likes drizzling his on fresh fish or delicately\ncooked French lentils.\n\n\n   The point of fine olive oil is that it enhances the taste of the\nfood.\n\n\n   Save the very best as an exquisite flavoring in butternut squash\nsoup, over grilled vegetables or dotted on gently steamed fava\nbeans, Evers said.\n\n\n   ``There is no one best oil. You should buy an inexpensive oil to\ncook with and you should use a series of very good oils to finish\nwith. You will end up with better flavor, less fat and spending\nless money,'' he said.\n\n\n   As the wine connoisseurs like to say: Try it. Your opinion is\nthe most important one.\n\n\n   (The Press Democrat in Santa Rosa, Calif., is part of the New\nYork Times Regional Newspaper Group.)",

We even tried the microwave.\n\n\n   In our series of taste tests, the Food staff agreed potatoes are\nbest when cooked in a 350-degree oven for 11/2 hours. Potatoes\nbaked at higher temperatures for less time had limp skins and dense\nflesh.\n\n\n   The most varied results, however, came from slight changes in\nthe cooking method.\n\n\n   The potatoes cooked in foil were a disaster _ they tasted more\nsteamed than baked. The skin was limp and chewy, the flesh dense\nand overly-moist.\n\n\n   Rubbing the potato with oil produced a similar steamed effect,\nbut the flavor was better.\n\n\n   And when microwaved, the potato turned into a shriveled, mushy\nmess.\n\n\n   &QL; \n &UR; THE BEST WAY &LR;\n\n\n   The plain potato, pierced with a fork to let steam escape,\nproduced the best results. Baked at 350 degrees for 11/2 hours, the\npotato emerged with a great flavor and a light and fluffy texture.\nIn addition, the skin was crisp but chewable.\n\n\n   &QL; \n &UR; AN APPEALING ALTERNATIVE &LR;\n\n\n   If you want a change from the pure baked potato experience, the\npotato rubbed with olive oil and coarse salt is a good choice. The\nskin absorbs the flavor of the oil and the flecks of salt give it\nadded visual interest.\n\n\n   Surprisingly, the Food staff found that the potato rubbed with\nbutter wasn't as good as the one with oil. It was fluffier inside,\nbut the cooked butter flavor didn't improve the outside.\n\n\n   &LR;  &QL; \n &UR; FOR THE HURRIED COOK &LR;\n\n\n   In a time crunch, you can microwave a potato for 5 minutes, then\nfinish it in a 350-degree oven for 10 minutes.

      "content": "THE GRILL OF YOUR DREAMS\n\n\n\n   With today's penchant for outdoor living, creating a luxurious\ncontemporary patio and back yard and investing in a fabulous custom\nbuilt-in barbecue _ an extension of the great room _ is one of the\nhottest trends.\n\n\n   But you don't have to have a lavish setting or a fancy grill to\nenjoy wonderful succulent foods cooked outdoors. A simple charcoal\nor gas grill _ or even a hibachi _ will do.\n\n\n   Grilling is still the all-American pastime. Seventy-five percent\nof U.S. households own and use a barbecue grill _ and more than 60\npercent of gas grill owners cook out several times a week\nyear-round, according to the Barbecue Industry Association.\n\n\n   ``Grilling is so easy and tasty, it's no wonder it is one of\nAmerica's favorite outdoor pastimes,'' says Kristi Fuller, editor\nof ``Better Homes and Gardens The New Grilling Book'' (Meredith\nBooks; $29.95). The down-to-earth volume covers all the basics _\nincluding information on regional preferences, starting a fire,\nheat control, timing tips, food safety, grilling gadgets and how to\nselect a grill. You'll also find a grilling glossary along with\ngrilling charts and tips sprinkled throughout the 372 pages, which\nfeature more than 500 recipes.\n\n\n   Taste was the primary focus, although simplicity and ease of\npreparation _ along with straightforward ingredients readily\navailable in supermarkets _ were also considerations in recipes,\nFuller says. All include prep and cooking times, as well as\nnutritional information.\n\n\n   Recipes run the gamut from condiments, appetizers, sides and\ndesserts to beef, veal, lamb, pork, chicken, turkey, fish,\nshellfish, game and fowl. A separate chapter covers smoke cooking\nwith recipes like Pecan-Smoked Pork Chops, Texas Beer-Smoked Ribs\nand Double-Smoked Salmon With Horseradish Cream.\n\n\n   When it comes to smoke cooking, Fuller favors an electric smoker\nbecause it's the most reliable. However, she suggests getting\nacquainted with the smoking process on a simple scale by using a\ncharcoal or gas grill before investing in other equipment such as a\nvertical water smoker or a horizontal dry smoker.\n\n\n   Cooking on gas or charcoal grills is done by one of two cooking\nmethods _ direct or indirect heat. Direct grilling _ where foods\nare placed directly over the heat source (and should be turned\nhalfway through the cooking time) _ is similar to broiling and\nbest-suited to foods that are tender, small or thin and cook\nquickly in less than 25 minutes. That includes burgers, steaks,\nkabobs, chops, hot dogs, boneless poultry, fish and most\nvegetables.\n\n\n   Direct grilling can be done with the lid up or down, but when\nthe cover is closed, the grill begins to simulate an oven. You can\ncook larger items such as roasts or bone-in poultry more slowly\nthis way and impart a smoky flavor.\n\n\n   When food is cooked by indirect heat, it is placed adjacent to,\nrather than directly over the coals _ and the cover is down. This\nmethod is used for large cuts of meat, ribs, whole fish and birds,\nand other foods that require longer, slower cooking.\n\n\n   When starting a charcoal grill, figure on mounding and igniting\nabout 30 briquettes per pound of meat to be cooked with the lid up.\nSince it'll take about 20 to 30 minutes for the coals to turn ash\ngray, start the grill 30 minutes before you're planning to grill\nthe food. Begin preheating a gas grill 10 to 15 minutes prior to\ncooking.\n\n\n   A key to successful grilling is determining the point when the\ncharcoal or gas will have attained the ideal temperature for\ncooking the food.\n\n\n   ``Too-high heat can char and dry out the food, while too-low can\ndefeat the quick-cooking benefit of grilling,'' says Fuller.\n\n\n   You can judge the approximate temperature of the coals by how\nlong you can hold your hand above the coals at the cooking level\n(of the food). If you can hold your hand comfortably over the coals\nfor only two seconds, figure that the fire is hot and the\ntemperature will be around 400 to 450 degrees F. Coals should\nappear barely covered with gray ash and be burning when done. A\nmedium fire e",

      "content": "Peter Martinelli, a Marin rancher committed to sustainable\nagriculture and organic farming, has a similarly optimistic message\nabout what many perceive as adversarial opposites. He thinks\ntraditional agricultural interests and environmentalists can be\nfriends, working together toward changes in land use that benefit\nboth interests.\n\n\n   Martinelli's family has been farming just north of Bolinas since\nthe 1930s. He didn't plan to follow in his father's and\ngrandfather's footsteps, but rather studied English and history at\nthe University of California at Berkeley.\n\n\n   The pull of the land, however, won out over academia. Not long\nafter graduation, Martinelli, now 36, was back in West Marin,\ntilling the soil and preaching the creed of the new environmentally\nsensitive farmer. He had a mentor of impeccable credentials: For\nnine years, he worked for Warren Weber, whose Star Route Farm,\nlaunched in the early '70s, was a trailblazer for a revitalized\norganic movement.\n\n\n   Martinelli, assisted by siblings and cousins, grows a variety of\ncool-werops _ potatoes, beets, carrots, lettuces (``no\ntomatoes or corn here,'' he jokes), garlic, chard, kale and winter\nsquash _ on his family's 20 acres.\n\n\n   The squash are particularly dear to his heart. They thrive in\nthe smket where his land is located _ it's a little more\nprotected than most of the surrounding land and therefore just a\nsmidgen warmer. The squash are also what he calls ``a low-life\nsupport crop'' _ from planting until harvest, they need little\ncare. They don't attract insects nor do they require much water.\n\n\n   Butternut and delicata are the most popular varieties _\nMartinelli says it's partly because of their sweetness and partly\nbecause they are manageable in size. Both those qualities appeal to\nhis customers who come to the Martinelli booth at the Saturday\nfarmers' market at Pt. Reyes Station and the Wednesday market in\nFairfax. He also has a stand at Tomales Bay that's open Wednesdays\nthrough Sundays.\n\n\n   The large _ in some instances, humongous _ squash he grows are\ngenerally headed for the kitchens of his restaurant clients, who\ninclude Manka's in Inverness, Insalata's in San Anselmo, and Chez\nPanisse and Cafe Rouge in Berkeley.\n\n\n   Restaurant chefs love to deal with these big boys _ kabocha,\nturban and banana, and the giant, curved Tahitian squash that\nresembles a butternut squash on growth hormones.\n\n\n   Martinelli intends to plant more varieties in the future,\nalthough he has already come at least half-circle. Historically,\nthe ranch, established in the 1870s, was first a dairy and apple\nfarm. His family started out raising beef cattle on the land, and\nthen he turned it into a vegetable farm.\n\n\n   He now feels that mixed use _ cattle and vegetables _ is\nprobably the most ecologically sound, allowing for on-site\nrecycling of just about all the byproducts of farming.\n\n\n   Martinelli's political fervor has not abated as his views have\nevolved. He lobbies government to provide incentives to family\nfarms so a healthy farm belt can survive around towns and cities.\nAnd he is dedicated to guiding consumers back to the once prevalent\nbelief that fresh food, lovingly grown in close proximity to its\nmarkets, delivers optimal taste and nutrition.",

The conditions on these wide plains\nnear the Wind River Range of the Rocky Mountains can be harsh, with\nhigh winds, late springs and early autumns limit the growing season\nto 90 days.\n\n\n   Revere's partner in this effort is Irene Houser, director of the\nNorthern Arapaho Tribe Community Services, who has distributed\nproduce around the Wind River Reservation and to the Pine Ridge\nReservation in southwestern South Dakota.\n\n\n   Ms. Houser, a member of the Northern Arapaho Tribe, said people\nwere stunned when she brought them bushels of potatoes, onions,\nsquash, zucchini, tomatoes, beets, radishes and other vegetables.\n\n\n   ``They asked, `How much are you going to charge me for this?'''\nshe recalled. ``I said, `It's free,' and they were so happy. Many\nof them didn't have food in their house when I showed up.''\n\n\n   Mark Soldierwolf, a 70-year-old father of nine and grandfather\nof nine, said: ``That food lasted us about six weeks. We dried some\nthings, boiled some. Just ate all of it.''\n\n\n   Soldierwolf, a Northern Arapaho who served with the Marines in\nWorld War II and the Korean War, lives with his wife, Florita, one\ndaughter and one grandchild. They receive food stamps for a\n$300-a-month budget for the four of them, but they said they often\nfed members of their family who stopped by. Soldierwolf estimated\nthey saved $70 with the free vegetables.\n\n\n   Soldierwolf's family represents the problems that plague many of\nthe 1.3 million American Indians who live on reservations, of whom\n49 percent are unemployed. The Bureau of Indian Affairs estimates\nthat at least half the American Indian population lives in poverty.\nSoldierwolf said all but one of his adult children were unemployed.\n\n\n   ``If you can make it to the end of the month, you're all\nright,'' Soldierwolf said, referring to the monthly food stamps.\n``It's worse than in the Depression.'' Mrs. Soldierwolf nodded,\nwith tears in her eyes.\n\n\n   The Wyoming Department of Family Services says the Northern\nArapaho on the reservation account for 18.9 percent of all welfare\ncases in Wyoming. The reservation population of 12,000 _ including\n6,000 Northern Arapaho tribal members, about 3,000 Shoshone tribal\nmembers and 3,000 from other tribes _ represents about 2.5 percent\nof the state's population of 480,000.\n\n\n   Revere and Ms. Houser say the community garden can help reduce\ndependence on welfare by enabling residents to produce cash crops,\ntraditional Indian plants to be sold on or off the reservation.\n\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n\n   On the Crow Reservation in Montana, at a five-acre garden to be\nplanted this fall, the plan is to let people's work part at the\ngarden count toward fulfillment of their welfare community service\nrequirement.\n\n\n   ``We are trying to provide people with skills that they can use\nhere or take with them,'' said Charlene Johnson, a Crow tribal\nmember and nutritionist with Indian Health Services. ``Indians are\nnot horticulturists.

After all, this was his first trip to\nthe United States and he had only seen the John F. Kennedy Airport,\ndowntown Schenectady and points in between.\n\n\n   A native of the East African nation of Tanzania, now with the\nGoteborg University in Sweden, Mlima was one of more than 200 of\nthe world's top economists attending the North American\nProductivity Workshop, held recently at Union College. The opening\nbanquet of the three-day seminar, as Mlima would learn somewhere\nbetween the hors d'oeuvres and first entree course, was not\nAmerican food, but authentic Thai cuisine.\n\n\n   Providing a six-course, 13-dish Asian repast as the opening\nmeal, was one of many ways organizers at the small private college\nmade a bookish seminar and trip to Schenectady attractive to the\nattendees from all parts of the globe.\n\n\n   Suthathip (Lek) Yaisawarng, chairwoman of the college's\ndepartment of economics, co-chair of the event and a native of\nBangkok, spent hours with the school's dining services staff\nteaching the finer points of cooking with ingredients such as black\nfungus (mushrooms) and makrood (kaffir lime leaves).\n\n\n   ``I liked to cook when I was child,'' said Yaisawarng, standing\nin the giant white tent erected for the feast in front of the Nott\nMemorial on the Union campus. ``I didn't know that I'd need to come\nback to it, and in such quantities!''\n\n\n   But early in the evening, dinner was proving to be a highlight\nof the workshop.\n\n\n   As a group of Union professors played Dixieland jazz, attendees\njuggled glasses of wine or bottles of beer and jostled each other\nfor plates of fish cakes with cucumber sauce. They conversed in\nEnglish, but the language came with a variety of heavy accents,\nincluding German, French, Australian, Arab, and even Southern. The\ndelegates hailed from at least 30 countries, including New Zealand,\nBangladesh, Hungary, Belgium and Japan.\n\n\n   Cocktail hour was followed by a soup course, which, though\nplenty spicy for some, was tame by Nostratollah Nafar's standards.\nNafar, a professor at Allameh Tabatabai University in Tehran, Iran,\nadded ground chili peppers by the tablespoon to his bowl.\n\n\n   More familiar with both Asian and American cuisine than Mlima,\nNafar explained, ``Chinese food not hot, it's sweet.''\n\n\n   It is important that people eat together, meet socially and form\npersonal relationships at events like this so when they get into a\nsession, they are more likely to open up and make the conference\nmore productive, said Yaisawarng.\n\n\n   If Mlima was disappointed to not be dining on New York strip\nsteaks and New England clam chowder at his first major feast in\nAmerica, it didn't last long.\n\n\n   As the servers brought bowls of lime sorbet between entree\ncourses, Nafar exclaimed, ``Here's American food _ ice cream!''\n\n\n   ___\n\n\n   THAI SPRING ROLL WITH SWEET AND SOUR SAUCE\n\n\n   2 tablespoons vegetable oil\n\n\n   3 cloves freshly chopped garlic\n\n\n   1 cup very lean ground pork\n\n\n   3 cups julienned carrot\n\n\n   2 packages cellophane noodles\n\n\n   2 ounces dried Chinese black mushrooms\n\n\n   1/2 cup chopped green onion\n\n\n   1/2 teaspoon black pepper\n\n\n   2 tablespoons Thai soy sauce\n\n\n   1 pack spring roll wrappers\n\n\n   2 tablespoons cornstarch mixed with 2 tablespoons water\n\n\n   Vegetable oil for deep frying\n\n\n   2 cups spicy sweet and sour sauce\n\n\n   1 cup vinegar\n\n\n   1/2 cup water\n\n\n   1/3 cup fresh cilantro leaves\n\n\n   Heat 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in frying pan.

If\nyou plan to use them within a week or two, you might want to\npurchased the refrigerated salsas, which are fresher tasting but\nnot as convenient. Salsas of all varieties (tomato, pineapple,\nmango and the like) lend themselves to adding Tex-Mex and other\nflavors to skillet creations, dips, rice, cold bean and corn\nsalads, salad dressings and more. Also use salsa to top grilled\nchicken breasts, steaks and the like. And of course, it's a great\ndip with chips when you have nothing else on hand.\n\n\n   FROZEN VEGETABLES: Keep a supply of lots of different single\nvegetables as well as combinations to use in salads, soups,\nstir-fries and more. Some favorites include corn for chowder, sugar\nsnap peas and various combinations for stir-fries, assorted strips\nof red, green and yellow peppers, baby peas and haricots verts. I\nlike the quality of some of the Trader Joe's offerings.\n\n\n   FROZEN FRUITS: Lots of possibilities are available including\npineapple, raspberries, strawberries, mango, melons and assorted\nfruits to make into quick fruit salads or compotes (serve topped\nwith cottage cheese for a light dinner during summer), cobblers or\npies. Single fruits or combinations are also great whirred into\nsmoothies for breakfast or a snack or pureed for sauces for ice\ncream, cake or waffles. Try processing frozen raspberries with tofu\nin a food processor for a quick frozen dessert.\n\n\n   SHREDDED CHEESES: Keep several kinds (flavor- and fat-wise) _\nincluding some of the blends _ ready to add to tostadas, lasagna,\ncasseroles, salads, pizzas, sandwiches or English muffins. The\nlarger the bag, the bigger the price break. Once opened, these\ncheeses have a tendency to lose freshness faster than a large block\nof cheese.\n\n\n   ROASTED RED PEPPERS: Available in jars (Mezzetta brand is my\npreference), these are wonderful for those in a hurry. Rinse and\ndrain them, then puree in a food processor for sauces or dips or\ncut them up and toss in soups, salads, sandwiches and main dishes.\nAlso try marinating pieces in oil, vinegar and a little garlic and\nserve as part of an Italian antipasto platter. Once you get in the\nhabit of using the bottled, you may never go back to roasting your\nown.\n\n\n   CANNED GREEN CHILES: Available whole or diced, these give a\nflavor boost to dips, quesadillas, rice, chiles rellenos, sauces,\nchili, pizzas, entrees of all kinds and more. Whenever I whip up a\ncrustless quiche for brunch or dinner, I pour beaten eggs mixed\nwith a little milk or cream and seasoned with chiles and seasoned\nsalt and garlic pepper over plenty of shredded cheese in a pie\nplate. Bake until set and you're in for some tasty dining.\n\n\n   CANNED AND BOTTLED OLIVES: I keep all colors and flavors of\npitted olives handy for tapenades (made in no time flat in the food\nprocessor) as well as to embellish casseroles and, particularly,\nsalads and pasta dishes. The tapenades can be mixed with cream\ncheese for a dip, spread on rustic bread slices to accompany soups\nand more.\n\n\n   ARTICHOKE HEARTS: I prefer the canned to frozen (which I find\nwatery and flavorless). Buy quartered and rinse and drain well (I\nadd a sprinkling of red wine vinegar and drain well to get rid of\nthe canned taste) before adding to cold marinated vegetable or\npasta salads. Also great in baked artichoke cheese dip. You'll find\nmany ways to use them.\n\n\n   PACKAGED ROASTED REFRIGERATED CHICKEN BREASTS: What a fabulous\nand convenient shortcut. To save money, I purchase these at a\nwarehouse store (Tyson brand) where they are in the neighborhood of\n$10-$12 per package of 6 or so breasts. Remove the skin and bones\nand slice, chop or cut in strips to use in the full gamut of dishes\nfrom soups and salads to entrees. Keep some frozen to thaw on a\ndime when you don't have any other protein on hand to help solve\nthe dinner dilemma.\n\n\n   ASSORTED MUSTARDS: I've been hooked on a large variety _\nincluding Dijon, honey mustard, grainy, hot and prepared yellow\nmustards _ for ye",

Medical science has begun to\ntest and recognize that substances called phytochemicals, which are\nneither vitamins nor minerals but are found in most fruits and\nvegetables by the tens of thousands, contain potent therapeutic\nproperties that often dramatically relieve and sometimes even\neliminate certain illnesses.\n\n\n   There is so much interest in these ``nutraceuticals'' that\npublic and private laboratories, including the National Cancer\nInstitute, are stepping up research by spending millions of dollars\nto see how best to identify, extract and use phytochemicals to\ncreate new drugs that in coming decades may be used to fight\ndiseases from the common cold to cancer.\n\n\n   At\nhttp://www.phys.com/bnutrition/01selfanalysis/05colds/colds.html, a\nsite sponsored by Conde Nast in collaboration with Tufts\nUniversity, you can find the latest in this exciting field of\nnutritional research. But the best part of the site is how we can\nuse what is known now in our own kitchens to whip up culinary\ncuratives when the need arises.\n\n\n   In a section called ``The Culinary Chemist,'' you will find\ndetailed information on phytochemically rich foods along with\nrecipes that can help relieve debilitating symptoms of a number of\nailments.\n\n\n   ``The Symptom Advisor'' asks you to check off certain symptoms\nyou may be experiencing, from congestion to nausea to diarrhea to\nheadaches, and then ``prescribes'' a dish that may help. It also\nadvises, of course, that under certain circumstances you should see\na physician.\n\n\n   Here are other interesting sites to visit:\n\n\n   &QR;  At ``Flu Food,'' at\nhttp://www.ab.sympatico.ca/Contents/Health/HEALTHYWAY/recflu.html,\nyou will find informative articles from various sources including\nBetter Homes and Gardens, CNN, Redbook and others concerning\nkitchen remedies. There also are lots of recipes.\n\n\n   &QR;  Http://www.naturalland.com/ is an interactive site where you\nchat and pick up tips about healing foods, fitness and nutrition.\nIt changes daily. A recent tip of the day: ``Celery juice has a\nmild diuretic effect, similar to many drugs that are prescribed for\nhigh blood pressure. The juice is highly nutritious and can be\nhelpful for people who need to balance their blood pressure.''\nAnother imparted this bit of nutritional wisdom: ``For optimum skin\nrepair and healing, increase intake of foods rich in vitamin A and\nzinc.

      "content": "WHY GOOD PEOPLE EAT BAD FOOD \n\n\n\n   Americans aren't stupid.\n\n\n   They've known for years that the fast food they're eating\nprobably isn't good for them. Back in 1988, 60 percent of fast food\ndiners told Consumer Reports that they were ``worried'' about the\nnutrient value of fast food, and only four percent felt the food\ndeserved top health marks.\n\n\n   The worriers had reason to fret. Although McDonald's and other\nfast food chains have added salads, grilled chicken, and other\nhealthful entrees in recent years, today's menus are still full of\nfoods that are bad for the heart, such as Burger King's Double\nWhopper with cheese, which contains a whole day's fat allowance\nunder one wrapper.\n\n\n   But that doesn't stop Americans from spending one in every seven\nfood dollars on fast food, as the lure of quick and inexpensive\nmeals outweighs their health concerns. In fact, more than three\nquarters of fast food eaters believe they're getting good value for\ntheir money, according to a recent survey by the National\nRestaurant Assocation.\n\n\n   Now, health researchers warn that many fast foods may be more\nhazardous than previously believed because so many contain ``trans\nunsaturated fatty acids'' or so-called transfats, a particularly\nhazardous type of fat that doesn't appear on food labels. Many\nfast-food french fries and other products are cooked in transfats,\nused to harden the vegetable oils restaurants now use instead of\nanimal fat.\n\n\n   Walter C. Willett, chairman of nutrition at the Harvard School\nof Public Health, has called on the US Food and Drug Administration\nto require transfat labelling on fast foods as part of the agency's\nnew transfat labelling regulations, arguing that consumers are\nconfused by ``deceptive labels such as `cholesterol-free' or\n`cooked in vegetable oil.' ''\n\n\n   But, even if the FDA agrees with Willett, few expect transfats\nto spur a revolution among fast food diners. McDonald's officials\nthought the anti-fat revolution was at hand once before, in the\nearly 1990s when they trotted out a hamburger with half the fat of\nnormal burgers. By 1997, with sales languishing, the McLean Deluxe\nwas cancelled.\n\n\n   ``It was launched with high hopes and seeming demand, but . . .\nthere wasn't really very much consumer interest in it,'' said\nMcDonald's spokesman Walt Riker.\n\n\n   However, for those who want to eat healthfully, there are plenty\nof choices at fast food restaurants, partly because chains know\nthat vegetarians or people on diets can veto the choice of\nrestaurant for an entire group of diners if there is nothing on the\nmenu that they want to eat.\n\n\n   In addition, the fast-growing Subway restaurant chain is going\ndirectly after health-conscious diners with a national advertising\ncampaign that stresses the low-fat content of their sandwiches. The\nmenu features seven submarine sandwiches containing less than six\ngrams of fat; among hamburgers, only a vegetarian ``garden burger''\ncan beat that.\n\n\n   Fortunately, there are plenty of guides to help consumers\nnavigate the world of fast food from books such as ``The Fast Food\nFreeway Guide: A Map to Lower Fat and Calories at Fast Food\nRestaurants,'' to Internet sites.\n\n\n   With a few clicks on Cyberdiet.com's ``Fast Food Quest''\nsection, users can compare fat, salt, cholesterol, calories, and\nother nutrition issues among hundreds of fast foods, comparing\nindividual restaurants directly or seeking out the healthiest foods\nfrom all of them. The fast food chains often have nutritional\ninformation on-line as well.\n\n\n   In the end, Americans' food choices are a contradictory matter\nin which health and nutrition are just one concern. People consume\nless fat and more fruit juice than they did 20 years ago, but at\nthe same time they consume far more soda and about 35 percent more\ncalories than the 2,000 recommended by the FDA. And so, they\ncontinue to line up to place their orders for such menu items such\nas the ``supersize'' Big Mac dinner _ all 1,410 calories of it.",

      "content": "`BAREFOOT CONTESSA COOKBOOK': SHOELESS IN THE KITCHEN \n\n\n\n   Parties catered by Ina Garten of the Barefoot Contessa in East\nHampton, N.Y., are characterized by dauntingly lavish, artfully\narranged displays of vegetables, breads, fruit, cheeses and cakes.\nBut as her ``Barefoot Contessa Cookbook'' (Clarkson N. Potter,\n$32.50) now reveals, the food from her shop could not be more\naccessible.\n\n\n   Aside from a few omissions, like the temperature for baking the\nterrific chocolate buttercream cake, this is an excellent starter\ncookbook, to set the novice on the path to successful dinners and\nparties, especially looking toward summer. Bright photographs, by\nMelanie Acevedo, show exactly how most of the food should look, and\nillustrations show the differences between mincing, dicing,\njulienne and chiffonade.\n\n\n   The recipes are replete with nice little touches, like the black\nsesame seeds garnishing the oil-glossed sugar snap peas, and\ndirections for roasting some of the tomatoes for the tomato-basil\nsoup. But with few exceptions, like the lobster pot pie, they are\nnot complicated.\n\n\n   Whenever possible, Ms. Garten suggests shortcuts, advance\npreparation and convenient substitutions, including canned and\nfrozen vegetables and prepared mayonnaise. Feel free to use\npackaged puff pastry, and do not expect to have to bake your own\nbread to re-create her food.\n\n\n   Little notes accompany the recipes, elaborating on the\ningredients and techniques. The navel orange segments specified in\nthe pretty beet salad, for example, must be cut away from the\nmembrane, not merely separated as when eating an orange.\n\n\n   All the dishes are designed for entertaining, whether it's\nplying weekend guests with staggeringly rich scones for breakfast,\nassembling an array of tasty dips to be scooped with endive leaves\nfor cocktails, making a big turkey meatloaf for more than one meal\nor recycling extra grilled lemon chicken breasts into a salad.\n\n\n   Most of the recipes serve six or more, and many will feed 10.\n(That chocolate buttercream cake will serve up to 12; bake it at\n350 degrees.)\n\n\n   Want to dazzle your guests? Try the roasted whole boned salmon\nwith a fennel stuffing. It couldn't be easier, and it most\ncertainly will produce raves when served at a buffet or dinner for\n10 to 15.\n\n\n   BEETS WITH ORANGE VINAIGRETTE\n\n\n   Adapted from ``The Barefoot Contessa Cookbook''\n\n\n   Time: 1 1/2 hours\n\n\n   3 bunches fresh beets\n\n\n   Kosher salt\n\n\n   2 navel oranges\n\n\n   2 tablespoons raspberry vinegar\n\n\n   2 tablespoons freshly squeezed orange juice\n\n\n   3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil\n\n\n   1/2 teaspoon sugar\n\n\n   1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\n\n\n   1/2 cup finely diced red onion.\n\n\n   1. Trim green tops from beets and place beets in large pot of\nsalted water. Bring to a boil and simmer uncovered about 1 hour, or\nuntil just tender. Drain and set aside until cool enough to handle.\n\n\n   2. Remove zest from oranges, preferably in long strips. Slice\noff the rest of the skin and all the pith. Holding the oranges over\na large bowl to catch any juice, use a sharp knife to cut the\nsegments out, away from the membrane.\n\n\n   3. Peel and dice beets into 1/2-inch pieces. Add to bowl along\nwith vinegar, orange juice, olive oil, sugar, pepper, red onion,\norange zest and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, or to taste. Mix well.\n\n\n   4.

      "content": "1998-05-08 \n Green Vegetables Becoming a greater Part of Tibetans' Diet \n\n\nLHASA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- A revolution is quietly taking\nplace on the dinner tables of an old ethnic group living on\nChina's Tibetan Plateau, as green vegetables enter their lives.\n\n\nTibetans used to get by only on zanba (roasted qingke barley\nflour), beef, mutton, and butter tea, and humorously referred to\nvegetables as \"grass\", a food of the Han, but they're now getting\nused to the taste of \"grass.\"\n\n\nA primary school teacher in Lhasa, Gaisang Zhoima, says that\nher family is now much more interested in vegetables than beef and\nmutton and that they even feel odd if a meal comes without\nvegetables. She says they usually have zanba and butter tea for\nbreakfast, rice, fried vegetables, and meat for lunch, and noodles\nor steamed buns with beef or mutton filling for supper.\n\n\nThen, on weekends and holidays, she is often busy cooking sea\nfood and vegetables. \"We didn't have much knowledge of nutrition\nin the past,\" she explains, \"but with the increasing contacts with\npeople outside the region, we Tibetans are paying more attention\nto a variety of food.\" And, what is more important, she says,\nalmost any vegetable can now be found in Lhasa.\n\n\nSince the beginning of the 1980s, the government of the Tibetan\nAutonomous Region has had policies encouraging people to produce\nvegetables.\n\n\nTibet now has 10 large vegetable centers, with Lhasa, the\ncapital, at the center, with a total of 1,200 ha of land that\nproduce nearly 100 million kg of vegetables each year.\n\n\nThey satisfy 90 percent of the local demand for vegetables,\nwhich have grown 10 percent in popularity each year, among both\nurban and rural people, in recent years.\n\n\nSome other fresh vegetables and seafoods are regularly shipped\nto the region.",

      "content": "THREE AND A HALF HOURS TO FRANCE, BY CAR \n\n\n\n   MALTA RIDGE, N.Y. _ As Route 9 shoots southward from Saratoga\nSprings, the grand Victorian mansions of the old spa yield to the\nfamiliar outposts of American road culture.\n\n\n   There are gas stations and convenience stores, a vegetable\nstand, a lawn-ornament emporium, a drive-in barbecue joint with\npicnic tables, and the rusticated cabins of the Thorobred Motel. It\ntakes a sharp eye to pick out, on the left, the silver diner with\nthe small rooftop sign: Chez Sophie Bistro.\n\n\n   The motorist who whizzes by in the afternoon is entitled to feel\na twinge of pity. That empty parking lot. That lonely diner. And\njust think of the misguided idealists who thought they could sell\nFrench food out in the wilderness.\n\n\n   But as dusk approaches, car after car takes a sharp left turn\ninto Sophie's. By 7, the lot is full, and so is the restaurant.\n\n\n   What they have found is a tiny bit of France 3,500 miles from\nParis, the neighborhood bistro that every New Yorker dreams of _\nlocated, unfortunately, in a neighborhood that takes three and a\nhalf hours to reach by car.\n\n\n   Chez Sophie is worth the drive. For nearly 30 years, it has been\nserving classic bistro dishes, the kind of deceptively simple food\nthat, for the French, makes life worth living.\n\n\n   In that time, the menu, printed on a mimeographed sheet of\npaper, has scarcely budged. The customers won't let it. They want\nthe caneton a la Sophie, tender slices of duck breast in a sweetly\npiquant apricot and green pepper sauce. They demand the veal\nscallops in a cream and lemon sauce.\n\n\n   Up and down the Hudson, innkeepers and new-wave restaurateurs\nhave made giant strides raising the region's culinary standards\nover the past decade. But Chez Sophie has been there all along,\nwith a single cook in the kitchen turning out one flawless dish\nafter another.\n\n\n   Yes, there is a Sophie. She is French, despite her all-American\nlast name (Parker), and six nights a week she serves 40 to 50 meals\nto customers who, in many cases, have eaten at the restaurant more\nthan 100 times. At the age of 73, she rules over a kitchen staff of\nprecisely two, not counting the dishwashers.\n\n\n   Her husband, Joseph, takes reservations, greets and seats and\nkeeps the diners happy. Her son, Paul, waits on tables and buys the\nfood and wine.\n\n\n   Bill and Kimberley Comiskey from nearby Malta eat at Sophie's\nevery Friday night, in the same booth. They have done so ever since\nthe restaurant moved to the diner about three years ago. That adds\nup to more than 150 meals, but the actual total runs much higher,\nbecause they come with friends on other nights and celebrate at\nSophie's on special occasions.\n\n\n   ``This is the place we compare others to,'' said Ms. Comiskey,\nwho operates a day spa in Latham. ``It's our benchmark.''\n\n\n   Mrs. Parker herself makes very limited claims for the place.\n\n\n   ``I do very simple things, actually,'' she said, seated at a\nfront booth in her chef whites early one afternoon, before the\nday's cooking got under way. ``I don't even think of it as French,\nreally, I just think of it as good food.''\n\n\n   In a way, the modesty is understandable. Chez Sophie cruises\nalong with a set menu of seven appetizers, eight main courses (plus\na fish and pasta of the day), and seven desserts. The wine list\nfits on two sides of a piece of typewriter paper: 39 whites on one\nside, 38 reds on the other.\n\n\n   There's a nice list of Belgian beers. The appetizers are priced\nfrom $4.50 to $10, the entrees from $21 to $29.\n\n\n   The offerings are pre-nouvelle: country pate, escargots in\nbutter and garlic, roasted poussin, steak with peppercorn sauce,\nchocolate mousse. There are a few contemporary touches, like a veal\nchop roasted with portobello and shiitake mushrooms, and quail in a\ncurrant sauce enlivened with balsamic vinegar, but that's as wild\nas things get.\n\n\n   Within tight, traditional limits, however, Chez Sophie makes\ngood on the promise implicit in the name ``bistro.'' The\ningredients are fresh, the flavors pristine, the presentation\nunfussy. The thinkin",

      "content": "&HT;      \n\n\n &UR;  &QL;  &LR; \n &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;  Bay Area grocery stores are making it possible for\nus to cook quickly without having to resort to frozen or heavily\nprocessed foods. With all of the freshly prepared foods _ fresh\nsalsa, cleaned and deveined shrimp, prewashed salad mixes and\nsmoked tofu, just to name a few _ why not take advantage?\n\n   However, some pre-prepared foods are better than others. Many\ncommercial pestos, for instance, have lost their fresh herbal\nflavor by the time you get them.\n\n\n   The trick is to find the best products. Pasta Etc. brand pesto,\nmade in Sonoma, has no cheese or oil and is flavored with miso.\nThat may not sound like pesto at all, but its bright basil flavor\nworks very well in this week's Fast &AMP; Fresh recipe.\n\n\n   The recipe is simple but elegant enough for a dinner party\nbecause of the way it looks _ luscious pink salmon atop golden\ncouscous, accented with green basil sauce. Quick pan-frying gives\nthe fillets a crisp crust and moist interior, and the pesto sauce,\nmixed with lemon juice, cuts through the richness of the fish.\n\n\n   Another excellent prepared product is achiote paste. Widely used\nin Mexico's Yucatan region, this seasoning base is made of ground\nannatto seeds, spices, vinegar and sometimes garlic. Mixed with oil\nand additional seasonings, achiote is an instant marinade that\ngives intense flavor and an appealing saffron-red color to meat and\nfish.\n\n\n   In this week's 30-minute recipe, chicken breasts are marinated\nin achiote, then quickly broiled. The chicken is placed on top of a\nsalad of crisp jicama and arugula dressed with lime juice and a\ntouch of cayenne, bringing the vibrant marinade to life.\n\n\n   Like all lasagnas, the Now &AMP; Later recipe, Lentil and Butternut\nSquash Lasagna, involves many steps. But it's worth every minute\nyou spend behind the stove.\n\n\n   A vegetarian dish created by my non-meat-eating friend\nElisabeth, the lasagna brings together butternut squash, roasted\nuntil creamy, with firm French lentils and intensely sweet\ncaramelized onions. A rich b &LR; e &LR; chamel sauce makes the layers float\non top of each other like clouds.\n\n\n   When making a many-stepped recipe like Lentil and Butternut\nSquash Lasagna, do all the prep work ahead of time. Chop the\nvegetables and herbs, measure the liquids and grate the cheese\nbefore you start cooking. Being organized allows you to cook many\nthings at once instead of trying to chop while minding something on\nthe stove.\n\n\n   If you like, break up the preparation by cooking the b &LR; e &LR; chamel\nand vegetables ahead of time, then layering the lasagna the next\nday. To reheat b &LR; e &LR; chamel, add a bit more milk and heat it slowly,\nstirring constantly. Do not allow it to boil.\n\n\n   &QL; \nFAST &AMP; FRESH: dinner in about 20 minutes\n\n\n   &LR;  &QL; \n &LR; PAN-FRIED SALMON FILLETS WITH LEMON PESTO &AMP; COUSCOUS\n\n\n   Ingredients:\n\n\n   6 tablespoons prepared pesto sauce (see note)\n\n\n   1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice\n\n\n   1 (10-ounce) package instant couscous\n\n\n   1/2 teaspoon salt + salt to taste\n\n\n   2 tablespoons + 1 teaspoon olive oil\n\n\n   4 boned skinless salmon fillets, 5 to 6 ounces each and 1-inch\nthick\n\n\n   Freshly ground pepper to taste\n\n\n   4 lemon wedges\n\n\n   Instructions:\n\n\n   If possible, let the pesto sit at room temperature for 20\nminutes before beginning preparation.\n\n\n   Mix together the pesto sauce and lemon juice.

Roman J. Lezo had been one of the first Marines to face a\ncourt-martial prosecution in a small but growing armed services\nprotest. But military officials in Kaneohe, Hawaii, instead offered\nhim a discharge under ``other than honorable circumstances.''\n\n\n   ``I am proud on this day for every American and I was proud to\nserve as a Marine, but I have no regrets about what happened,''\nsaid Lezo, 20, who pleaded guilty last month to disobeying the\norder to take the shot. ``They are losing some of the best Marines\nover this because they are ... taking their health as their first\npriority.''\n\n\n   Lezo was one of 14 Marines in Hawaii who refused to take the\nseries of six shots, base officials said. More than 200 troops, who\nbelieve the drug is not properly tested and can cause long-term\nhealth problems, have chosen punishment or resignation rather than\ntake the vaccine, according to Pentagon officials.\n\n\n   ``He is finally out of the clutches of the Military-Industrial\nComplex,'' said Lezo's mother, Roberta Lezo. ``We are ecstatic to\nhave him home.''\n\n\n   Rather than face six months in jail, loss of two-thirds of his\npay and a dishonorable discharge with a felony on his record, Lezo\nopted to avoid a trial and admit guilt for disobeying an order.\n\n\n   But because of his discharge, he has lost all of his military\nbenefits, including his right to the GI Bill, which would have\nguaranteed him $15,000 for college.\n\n\n   ``My health was my No. 1 concern. Nobody wanted to take these\nshots,'' Lezo said. ``They are trying to push this shot on people\nand it's not right.\n\n\n   ``It's a shame it had to come to this.''\n\n\n   Anthrax is a bacterium that can be used as a biological warfare\nagent _ one of the deadliest ever developed _ with a 90 percent\nfatality rate if left untreated.\n\n\n   Since the Food and Drug Administration approved the vaccine in\nthe 1970s, no long-term effects have been reported, said Virginia\nStephanakis, spokeswoman for the Army Surgeon General's Office at\nthe Pentagon. As of July 1, only 70 of the 303,000 vaccinated\ntroops have suffered side effects, Stephanakis said.\n\n\n   Other Marines like Lezo have suffered greater consequences for\nrefusing the vaccine.\n\n\n   Most recently, three Marines were court-martialed June 23 with\ntwo others facing charges at Twentynine Palms Ground Combat Center\nin the Mojave Desert.\n\n\n   Six Marines based at the Miramar Marine Corps Air Station and\nCamp Pendleton also are facing courts-martial for refusing to take\nthe mandatory shots.\n\n\n   During his ordeal, Lezo said he was berated and sometimes\nthreatened by military officials.\n\n\n   ``They would tell me that I was risking the lives of the entire\nsquad, and they warned me that if I didn't take it I would be\nconvicted and not be able to get a job even at McDonald's,'' Lezo\nsaid.\n\n\n   Lezo was charged with disobeying a lawful order from a\ncommanding officer and dereliction of duty. He also faced a charge\nof failure to obey an order from a noncommanding officer, which was\nnot related to the anthrax case.\n\n\n   Once a lance corporal with a secret security clearance, Lezo had\nbeen demoted, given extra duties, confined to his barracks and lost\nhalf of his pay prior to his discharge.\n\n\n   The ex-Marine who was a helicopter mechanic is planning to\nenroll in college in the fall and hopes to become a commercial\nairline pilot. But in the meantime he is looking for work in the\naeronautics industry.\n\n\n   ``It's time to start my life over,'' he said.\n\n\n   And on this Independence Day, he spent the evening at a barbecue\nwith old friends.\n\n\n   ``It's good to be home,'' he said.\n\n\n   X X X &QL;",

      "content": "THE APPETITE WAITS FOR NO BIRD \n\n\n\n   Probably the most challenging part of cooking Thanksgiving\ndinner is deciding what to serve until the turkey is carved. You\nneed some kind of diversionary starter for everyone to nibble at\nwhile the lumps are being mashed out of the potatoes and whisked\nout of the gravy, but it can't be anything really rich or heavy or\nfilling, or no one will ever make it to the pumpkin pie.\n\n\n   And it certainly can't be anything that takes more than a few\ningredients and a couple of steps to assemble on a day when even\nthe best cook feels overwhelmed.\n\n\n   You could just go out and buy a few sneaky convenience foods,\nbut the flavors would seem off before a meal that celebrates real\nhome cooking. A better way to give the appearance of being a\ngenerous and caring cook without becoming a galley slave is to\nchoose from some quick, simple and surprisingly different starters\nbased on ideas borrowed from classic hors d'oeuvres.\n\n\n   Only one of these takes more than 15 minutes of work, most of\nthem far less. They are all familiar enough to serve to\nunadventurous relatives on this all-American holiday, but each one\nhas a little twist.\n\n\n   Perhaps my favorite is real onion dip, ideally served with\npotato chips but almost as good with calorie-deficient raw\nvegetables. Ever since Lipton took over the supermarket aisle,\nonion dip has been routinely made with powdered onion soup mix.\nEven in cookbooks you find recipes like, ``Stir 3 tablespoons onion\nsoup mix into 1 cup sour cream.'' There had to be a way to make it\nsimple without opening up a packet full of mystery ingredients.\n\n\n   It seemed to me that the original idea was to imitate the\ndominant flavor of onion soup _ caramelized onions _ so I tried\ndoing exactly that. I minced some onions, cooked them in oil until\nthey were well browned and then stirred them into sour cream.\n\n\n   It was a fresh, three-ingredient dip (if you count the oil,\nwhich you drain), with clarity, intensity and complexity of flavor.\n(You can make and serve this right away, but the onion taste\nintensifies if you allow it to sit, refrigerated, for about a day.)\n\n\n   Similarly, I decided I could improve on the standard recipe for\nshrimp cocktail sauce, which I always found thin and uninspired.\nWithout departing too far from the original, made with Heinz chili\nsauce, I came up with a richer, tastier cocktail sauce by borrowing\nan idea from the famed French chef Joel Robuchon, who adds a little\nbutter.\n\n\n   That not only makes the sauce cling to the shrimp better, but\nmakes it taste equally good warm or cold. (I like it warm, just as\na contrast to the cold shrimp.)\n\n\n   Three other Thanksgiving tidbits I developed are even easier,\nstarting with marinated olives. All you have to do is toss a\nvariety of olives in olive oil, garlic and herbs; let them stand an\nhour; then stand back while guests ask incredulously, ``What did\nyou do with these?''\n\n\n   The addition of a fragrant, tangy lemon cut into segments makes\nthem even more special. But the real key is to use an assortment of\ngood olives, preferably the kind produced in France, Italy, Greece\nor Spain and sold in bulk.\n\n\n   If possible, include some oil-cured olives, which really come to\nlife when marinated. You can marinate the olives up to a week in\nadvance if you like.\n\n\n   The unusually warm fall this year inspired another super-simple\nappetizer. Fresh figs are still in produce markets _ and still\nripening in California _ and they can be halved and stuffed with\nany creamy, flavorful cheese. Usually I rely on a good blue, but\ncreamy goat cheese, drizzled with balsamic vinegar, is more\ncrowd-pleasing.\n\n\n   Finally, I wanted a simple, light dipping sauce for raw\nvegetables, so I warmed olive oil with garlic, freshened the mix\nwith uncooked olive oil, seasoned it with lots of salt and pepper\nand spiked it with lemon rind. The flavors go great with fennel,\none of the easiest of vegetables to convert into crudites.\n\n\n   Just trim the bulb by cutting off the bottom half-inch or so,\nthen stand it up on its flat end and slice downward to ma",

      "content": "VEGGIES SIZZLE ON THE GRILL\n\n\n\n   Grilling and backyard barbecues most often conjure up images of\nsizzling steaks, burgers, chicken or fish.\n\n\n   But has it ever crossed your mind to toss a colorful array of\nfresh vegetables on the grill? If not, you'll be amazed at how\nsimple, healthy and fabulous tasting grilled produce can be.\n\n\n   ``Most vegetables cook beautifully on the grill with just a\nminimum of preparation or attention,'' notes Kelly McCune in her\n``Vegetables on the Grill'' cookbook.\n\n\n   ``We have been encouraging people to cook an entire meal on the\ngrill for years, and finally people are coming around,'' says Betty\nHughes, consumer affairs director for Weber-Stephen Products Co.,\nthe company that manufactures Weber grills. ``People are really\nmissing out if they don't do vegetables on the grill.''\n\n\n   Grilling vegetables heightens their natural sweetness resulting\nin a fabulous smoky, carmelized flavor that is very different from\nthose that are steamed, microwaved or boiled.\n\n\n   The smoky flavor is derived from the juices from the vegetables\ndropping down on the grill's heat source and thus cooking and\ncarmelizing the sugars in the vegetables, says Hughes. ``You'll get\nthe same smoky flavor whether you use a gas or charcoal grill.''\n\n\n   For more of a wood flavor add flavored wood chips to a gas\ngrill, advises Hughes. Simply place wet chips in a small foil pan\nand put the pan in the hottest area of the grill underneath the\ncooking grates, which in Weber gas grills is in the front left hand\ncorner. Don't place the food directly above the chips to avoid a\nflare up or a fire.\n\n\n   Experiment and learn what works best on your grill. Here are\nsome tips for success _ gleaned from experts and our hands-on\nexperience:\n\n\n   Vegetables are easiest to manage and hold their shape best when\ngrilled in larger pieces. For instance, cut zucchini and eggplant\n(either Japanese or regular) into lengthwise slices rather than\nsmall pieces. Tomatoes are best grilled halved rather than in\nslices or quarters. Same goes for red, white or yellow onions and\nred, green or yellow bell peppers. Asparagus, mushrooms and green\nonions should be left whole.\n\n\n   To keep asparagus spears from falling through the cooking\ngrates, use thicker spears or tie thinner spears together into\nbundles of five or six spears with plain kitchen twine.\n\n\n   There are several ways to grill corn on the cob. You can soak\nthe husks in water for an hour and then place them on the grill or\ncook in the husks without soaking. Unlike other veggies, corn needs\nto be turned often when grilling. If desired, a couple of minutes\nbefore serving, peel back the husks to get a little brown color and\ngrill marks on the corn, along with some additional smoky flavor.\n\n\n   For best results and fastest cooking, be sure the grill is very\nhot before adding the vegetables of your choice, emphasizes Hughes.\nStart a charcoal grill 30 minutes in advance of cooking or preheat\na gas grill for 10 to 15 minutes.\n\n\n   The simplest and best way to grill vegetables is to brush them\nall over with olive or vegetable oil, and place on the grill. No\nblanching needed.\n\n\n   While we prefer to season with salt and garlic or regular pepper\nafter grilling, some cooks like to toss the vegetables with oil,\nsalt and pepper prior to grilling. Don't bother to marinate\nvegetables before grilling as they don't absorb much, if any,\nmarinade.\n\n\n   For more flavor _ after grilling _ drizzle the produce with\nherb-flavored oils, dressings or marinades and fresh herbs, but go\neasy so the clean sweet flavors of the vegetables dominate. Hughes\nlikes to add bottled vinaigrette dressing to a platter of grilled\nvegetables before serving as a side dish.\n\n\n   Be sure the cooking grates are clean before you grill, notes\nLisa Hanauer, an Oakland-based food writer and former chef\nrestaurateur, who loves grilling vegetables and shares her\ncorn-on-the cob grilling tricks in the September issue of Taunton's\nFine Cooking magazine.\n\n\n   Although grill experts have differing opinions, we found wiping\nthe cooking grates light",

And \nthat's really sad,'' she said. \n\n\n\tChampagne, an associate research professor at Pennington and a  \nregistered dietitian, used the U.S. Department of Agriculture's \nContinuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals. \n\n\n\tThat survey's database translates each kind of food into food  \npyramid servings. For instance, French fries are both vegetable and \nfat. A superdeluxe pizza includes bread, fat, cheese, meat, and \nvegetables. \n\n\n\tThe USDA defines a serving of vegetables as 1 cup of raw leafy  \nvegetables, a half- cup of other vegetables, or 3/4 cup of vegetable \njuice. \n\n\n\tChampagne looked at the total figures for vegetables, then  \nchecked for fries and chips, and worked out what percentage they \nmade up of the total. She presented her findings at a conference \nsponsored by the National Institutes of Health and others at Emory \nUniversity. \n\n\n\tShe found that even children younger than 7 years old got 27.3  \npercent of their vegetables as fries and chips. The figure rose to \n28.9 percent for children aged 7 to 12, 31.2 percent for those aged \n13 to 18 -- and 40 percent for black teens. \n\n\n\t``Why do I find that not surprising, when one-fourth of the  \nbreakfasts eaten by adults in the United States are eaten at \nMcDonalds?'' said Dr. Harold Solomon, a childhood obesity \nspecialist at Beth Israel-Deaconess Hospital and an associate \nprofessor at Harvard. \n\n\n\tBonnie Liebman of the Center for Science in the Public Interest  \nuses snacks to get her own three children to eat more fruits and \nvegetables. \n\n\n\t``In the late afternoon, they're starving. I'll cut up carrots,  \nred peppers, maybe give them a little dressing to dip it in, and \nput it next to them while they're doing their homework. It's \nusually gone by dinner,'' she said. \n\n\n\t``It's too bad our culture says you should eat junk between  \nmeals.'' \n\n\n\tThe USDA's data is solid and Champagne's approach sounds  \nreasonable, said Michael Goran, a professor of preventive medicine \nat the University of Southern California and a specialist in \nchildhood obesity. \n\n\n\t``I think it's very sound,'' said American Dietetic Association  \nspokeswoman Jackie Berning, an assistant professor at the \nUniversity of Colorado in Colorado Springs.",

It's good if\nyou can intersperse lean meat cubes with fatty, and cut pieces\nabout the same size so they will cook evenly.

A set of six is\n$15.\n\n\n   If you use wood skewers, soak them in water for about an hour\nbefore using to keep them from burning while on the grill. You can\nalso wrap the ends in foil. It's also a good idea to grease the\ngrilling grate generously to prevent sticking.\n\n\n   One trick: Use a kebab rack. These stand about 2 inches high,\nand you place the skewers on top so they are just above the grate,\nbut not touching it. We spotted one at Stein Mart for $14.99.\n\n\n   Finally, the last trick to kebabs is the unskewering. As he\ntraveled the world sampling kebabs, cookbook author Steven Raichlen\ndiscovered the best way to handle this dilemma.\n\n\n   He suggests holding a skewer with one hand, and then, with a\npiece of thick bread in the other, pull the meat toward you a bit\nto loosen; everything should just slide off.\n\n\n   Below, we give you a few of the international recipes Raichlen\ndiscovered while working on ``The Barbecue! Bible'' (Workman\nPublishing, $18.95) plus some others we tried.\n\n\n   MAIN DISH\n\n\n   Madeira Beef and Bay Leaf Kebabs (Espetada)\n\n\n   Makes 4 servings Preparation time: 20 minutes Marinating time:\n4-6 hours Cooking time: 8-12 minutes\n\n\n   Grilled beef is popular throughout Portugal, but on the island\nof Madeira, this kebab is the favorite. It used to be cooked\ndirectly on branches from bay leaf trees. Here, we stick with the\nleaves. Steven Raichlen recommends serving with crusty bread for\nsoaking up the juices as shown below.\n\n\n   1 1/2pounds beef tenderloin or boneless sirloin\n\n\n   1/4cup extra-virgin olive oil\n\n\n   1/4cup red wine vinegar\n\n\n   1onion, finely chopped\n\n\n   1/2cup chopped fresh Italian (flat-leaf) parsley\n\n\n   4cloves garlic, finely chopped\n\n\n   1teaspoon salt\n\n\n   1teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\n\n\n   12bay leaves\n\n\n   Trim any sinews and excess fat off the beef, then cut the meat\ninto 1 1/2-inch cubes. Combine the olive oil, vinegar, onion,\nparsley, garlic, salt and pepper in a large nonreactive baking\ndish. Add the beef and toss thoroughly to coat. Cover and let\nmarinate in the refrigerator for 4 to 6 hours.\n\n\n   Preheat the grill to high. Remove the beef and bay leaves from\nthe marinade and thread onto the skewers, dividing the bay leaves\namong the kebabs. When ready to cook, oil the grill grate. Arrange\nthe kebabs on the hot grate and grill, turning with tongs, until\nthe meat is cooked to taste, 2 to 3 minutes per side (8 to 12\nminutes in all) for medium-rare. Baste the espetadas with any\nexcess marinade, but not during the last 3 minutes. Serve the\nespetadas on or off the skewers on slices or chunks of Portuguese\nbread for soaking up the juices.\n\n\n   Per serving: 273 calories, 32 grams protein, 15 grams fat\n(percent calories from fat, 49) , 1 grams carbohydrate, 95\nmilligrams cholesterol, 371 milligrams sodium.\n\n\n   MAIN DISH\n\n\n   Oriental Chicken Kabobs\n\n\n   Makes 4 servings\n\n\n   Preparation time: 20 minutes Cooking time: 10-12 minutes\n\n\n   Here is a light, flavorful kebab infused with some of our\nfavorite Asian tastes _ hoisin and ginger.

And there is no lack of buyers despite of the staggering\nprice.\n\n\nNewly developed semi-finished food made of corn flour, buck\nwheat flour and oats have a ready market in many parts of the\nregion.\n\n\nThis indicates a change in people's mind on dietary habits and\na social progress, said a regional commercial official.\n\n\nReviewing the historical change, the official said, coarse food\ngrain served as the principal food in the region two or three\ndecades ago, accounts for 70 percent of the total food\nsupply. Each family used to save the limited supply of flour and\nrice for children and the old in the 1970s and the annual per\ncapita consumption of meat was no more than five kg. Now the per\ncapita consumption of meat is more than 40 kg.\n\n\nWith living standards improving since China's economic reforms\nwhich began in 1979, people gradually replaced wild vegetables\nwith high-grade varieties.

      "content": "NEWS STORY \n 2000-03-29 02:10 \n New Soybean Oil Said Healthier  \nBy PHILIP BRASHER, AP Farm Writer\n\n\n   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A new soybean developed by government\nscientists yields oil that, once processed, has far less\nheart-damaging fats and other substances than other cooking oils.\n\n\n   The oil straight from the soybean has less than half the\nsaturated fat of conventional varieties. Also, it does not have to\ngo through a process that produces artery-clogging trans fatty\nacids.\n\n\n   Soybean oil is used in foods from margarine to crackers. Food\nmanufacturers are eager to find a healthier version, because the\nFood and Drug Administration plans to require the listing of trans\nfats on food nutrition labels.\n\n\n   The soybean holds ''excellent potential'' for food makers and\n''will provide the needed flexibility to be used in a wide variety\nof products,'' the Institute of Shortening and Edible Oils, which\nrepresents companies that process vegetable oils, said in a letter\nto the United Soybean Board. The board helped fund the USDA\nresearch.\n\n\n   ''Just by changing the kind of oil that's used by food\nmanufacturers and restaurants would go a long way to reducing heart\ndisease in this country,'' Margo Wootan, director of nutritional\npolicy for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, said\nTuesday.\n\n\n   Shoppers won't see the new product before next year at the\nearliest, because the first commercial crop being planted next\nmonth in North Carolina will be saved for seed and testing.\n\n\n   The new soybean was developed by Agriculture Department\nscientists in Raleigh, N.C., using conventional breeding methods\nand not genetic engineering, which has become controversial in\nEurope and Asia.\n\n\n   More than 80 percent of the vegetable oil used in cooking and\nfood manufacturing comes from soybeans because of its relatively\nlow price and wide availability.\n\n\n   But soybean oil cannot be used for cooking unless it is\nhydrogenated to extend its shelf life and improve its flavor.\nHydrogenation, which also solidifies the oil, removes linolenic\nacid, a substance that causes the oil to taste rancid when heated.\nThe new soybeans have a third as much linolenic acid as\nconventional varieties.\n\n\n   Pioneer Hi-Bred International, a unit of DuPont, has a soybean\nwith half as much linolenic acid as conventional soybeans. Unlike\nthe USDA soybean, however, the Pioneer variety isn't lower in\nsaturated fat.\n\n\n   Hydrogenated oil would still be needed for some products, such\nas baked goods, to give them the proper texture and body, but\nmanufacturers could blend in unhydrogenated oil to lower the\noverall content of trans fat, industry experts say.\n\n\n   Health experts say trans fatty acids may be even worse for the\nheart than saturated fat, but consumers have no way of knowing how\nmuch of it is in food.\n\n\n   Margarine made from hydrogenated soybean oil now lists only the\nsaturated fat -- about 2 grams per serving -- and not the 3 grams of\ntrans fat. Three Nabisco's Chips Ahoy! cookies, for example, total\n2 grams of saturated fat along with another 2 grams of trans fat.\n\n\n   The FDA's labeling plan spurring the search for healthier\ncooking oil would require the amount of trans fat in a footnote on\nnutrition labels while adding the amount of saturated fat in the\nusual listing.\n\n\n   ''We want to do everything we can to avoid the labeling when it\ncomes,'' Jay Franklin, an Oklahoma soybean farmer, said Tuesday.\n\n\n   About 1,000 acres of USDA's new soybean will be planted this\nyear, enough to produce seed for 50,000 acres in 2001, said Richard\nWilson, a scientist working on the project. Varieties with similar\ntraits are being bred for local growing conditions in nine other\nstates: Georgia, Indiana, Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, Ohio,\nSouth Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia.\n\n\n   ------\n\n\n   On the Net: USDA's Agricultural Research Service:\nhttp://www.ars.usda.gov\n\n\n   United Soybean Board site: http://www.unitedsoybean.org\n\n\n AP-NY-03-29-00 0210",

      "content": "FENNEL ADDS A LILT \n\n\n\n   A single vegetable brought to its essence _ that's the meaning\nof summer soup. Winter soups, with their soothing richness and\nwarmth, tend to be a composition of ingredients _ beef-vegetable,\nchicken-noodle, chowder, minestrone.\n\n\n   But summer soups refresh rather than soothe. And with so many\nvegetables hitting their peak of freshness, my first urge for\nsummer soups is to isolate each one and make it more than what it\nis on the vine, to refine it to its purest form. (An exception is a\nbright gazpacho, whose many flavors blend into a single taste.)\n\n\n   The beauty of summer soups _ one main ingredient served hot or\ncold _ is that they're so easy. Zucchini, spinach, tomato, bell\npepper: the less you change them, the better.\n\n\n   The technique for all vegetables is the same; learn it and you\ncan transform any vegetable into an extraordinary summer soup,\nwhether it's pea or fennel, watercress or artichoke, tomato,\ncarrot, haricots verts or even a soup of fine herbs, tarragon,\nchive, parsley and chervil.\n\n\n   It's just a matter of cooking your vegetable, pureeing it in a\nblender, adjusting the consistency with stock or water, seasoning\nit, and straining. Some vegetables, like tomatoes and cucumbers,\ndon't need to be cooked.\n\n\n   The principle is simple: separate the flavor and color from what\ncontains it, the cellulose. The tool that separates it is the\nchinois.\n\n\n   The chinois, a fine-meshed conical sieve, is critical to these\nsoups. It creates the texture of luxury. The chinois combines\nlayers of fine mesh that catch even the smallest particles of\nfiber, producing a finely textured liquid that feels like silk or\nsatin. Certainly, you could heat your puree and serve it without\nstraining, or you might pass it through a food mill and then\nthrough a strainer. But again, when you're looking for an essence\nof something, you must remove all the extraneous vegetable fiber\nthat has no flavor.\n\n\n   My thinking about soups is so similar to my approach to sauces\nthat I always wonder, is sauce a soup or is soup a sauce? Which\ncame first? If it's a great summer soup, it can be a great sauce,\ntoo. And vice versa. Sometimes we'll make a sauce that tastes so\ngood, we decide to put it in a cup and call it soup.\n\n\n   Soups are the most chameleonlike dishes. They can be served at\nany point during the meal _ as a canape, a first course, the\nperfect intermezzo, a dessert canape, the dessert or a sauce.\n\n\n   My favorite way is as opening canapes _ two or three spoonfuls\nof intense flavor presented in small white bowls before the meal\nbegins. A canape soup excites the senses and prepares you for the\nmeal ahead. And these summer soups make the very best canapes,\nbecause they focus on a single flavor. One sip of carrot soup\nshould be as powerful in flavor as a mouthful of carrots.\n\n\n   Elements of finesse make a big difference. And cooking the\nvegetable well is one of them. All green vegetables should be\ncooked in so much water that the water does not lose its boil,\nwater that has a cup of salt for every gallon, and the cooked\nvegetable must immediately be shocked in ice water. This big-pot\nblanching and chilling insures the brightest green possible.\n\n\n   Root vegetables and red and yellow bell peppers are simmered in\na small amount of stock or cream, then blended.\n\n\n   Another element of finesse is introducing some sort of fat _\ncream or oil _ to enrich the flavor and add body, although some\nvegetables, like cucumber and sorrel, require no fat. Perhaps\nyou'll also want an acid like sherry or balsamic vinegar.\n\n\n   Some vegetables benefit from a secondary component (add a little\nblanched dill to the cucumber puree for cucumber soup, for\ninstance). But ultimately, the great summer soup is a single cooked\nvegetable pureed and strained through a chinois.\n\n\n   Gazpacho is the perfect warm-weather soup, and the\ninterpretation I offer here is intense, and easy. The main\ntechnique is turning on your blender, and then straining the\nliquid. The flavor is extraordinary because you're using fresh\ningredients _ cucumbers, onion,",

Any type\nof oven will do: gas, electric or convection.\n\n\n   If you are in no hurry _ and if you have an oven setting of less\nthan 200 degrees, which is usually marked ``warm'' _ use that\nsetting and let the fruit dry for up to 12 hours. If 200 degrees is\nyour lowest setting, dry the fruit for no longer than 6 hours. The\nlarger the pieces, the moister the fruit (or vegetable) will\nremain.\n\n\n   Simply place the pieces on baking sheets lined with parchment\npaper, leaving at least an inch around each one, and put the sheets\nin a low oven. Take a peek from time to time; the drying is done\nwhen the edges begin to curl, the flesh begins to firm up and the\ncenter is still very soft. Or just taste the fruit as it dries, and\nremove it when it reaches the intensity you like.\n\n\n   For this fall salad, the pears are only lightly dried. They\nretain a great deal of their moisture, and their sugar takes on\njust a hint of caramel. To add an even greater depth of flavor, I\nmarinate them in port and ginger before sending them off for a long\nbask.\n\n\n   COMPOSED SALAD OF RED OAK-LEAF LETTUCE, FENNEL, OVEN-DRIED\nPEARS, TOASTED WALNUTS AND MAYTAG BLUE CHEESE\n\n\n   Time: 2 hours 15 minutes, including 2 hours marinating and\ndrying\n\n\n   6 Comice pears\n\n\n   1 cup port wine\n\n\n   3 tablespoons light brown sugar\n\n\n   1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger\n\n\n   { cup extra virgin olive oil\n\n\n   3 tablespoons fine quality, well-aged balsamic vinegar\n\n\n   Coarse salt and freshly cracked black pepper to taste\n\n\n   2 medium fennel bulbs\n\n\n   2 heads red oak-leaf lettuce, well washed, dried and pulled\napart\n\n\n   { cup toasted walnut pieces (if available, black walnuts add an\ninteresting note)\n\n\n   4 ounces Maytag Blue Cheese.\n\n\n   1. Peel pears, cut them in half lengthwise, and carefully remove\ncore and stem.\n\n\n   2. Combine port, brown sugar and ginger in a shallow baking\ndish. Add pear halves, cut-side down, and spoon port mixture over\nthem. Cover with plastic film and marinate for 1 hour, turning from\ntime to time.\n\n\n   3. Preheat oven to 200 degrees. Place marinated pears on a\nparchment paper-lined baking sheet in the oven, and dry for about 1\nhour or until pears are just beginning to firm but remain moist in\nthe center.\n\n\n   4. Whisk together the olive oil and vinegar. Season to taste\nwith salt and cracked black pepper. Wash and trim the fennel bulbs.\nCut bulbs in half lengthwise, then cut fennel lengthwise into very\nthin slices.\n\n\n   5. Beginning at the wide end, cut each half of pear lengthwise,\ndown to but not through the stem end.\n\n\n   6. Toss lettuce and fennel together. Add a small amount of\ndressing, and toss to combine. Place equal portions of the dressed\nmixture on each of six luncheon plates. Fan two pear halves across\nthe greens, overlapping the stem ends. Sprinkle a few walnut pieces\naround the edges of the plates. Crumble an equal portion of the\ncheese over each plate. Drizzle a bit of the remaining dressing\nover the top, and serve.\n\n\n   Yield: 6 servings.",

Mine always turn out\nwatery.\n\n\n   A: Chances are you are not simmering it long enough. Good,\nflavorful stocks need hours of gentle cooking in order to encourage\nthe meats, bones and vegetables to give up their flavors.\n\n\n   Depending upon the stock you are making, be prepared to simmer\nit anywhere from one to six hours. Fish and vegetable stocks cook\nquickly, chicken stocks fall in the middle, and beef and veal\nstocks can cook almost all day for the richest results.\n\n\n   Start by covering the ingredients with two inches of cold water\nand slowly bringing the mixture to a simmer. Using cold water is\nimportant. Shirley Corriher, a food scientist, says that if you add\nmeats and vegetables to hot water, their starches will expand and\ngel, which inhibits the release of flavor.\n\n\n   Using a variety of vegetables is also essential. Onions, leeks,\ngarlic, celery and carrots are the standards, but don't limit\nyourself. Parsnips add sweetness, mushrooms, an earthy flavor, and\na halved tomato lends richness and an attractive, ruddy color.\nBeware of assertive, cruciferous vegetables like cabbage or\nbroccoli, which can overpower a stock. Parsley and other herbs, a\nbay leaf, peppercorns and cloves add nuances.\n\n\n   If you are making a brown stock _ one in which you roast the\nbones before simmering _ add some vegetables to the roasting pan.\nThey will caramelize, and their flavors will intensify. You can\nroast vegetables for a vegetable stock, too.\n\n\n   As for salt, add just a little at the beginning (say, a half\nteaspoon) to help draw flavor from the vegetables and bones. Before\ntaking the stockpot off the heat, taste the broth to see if it is\nintense enough (add a sprinkling of salt to the spoon). If it\ntastes weak, keep simmering until it is rich and flavorful. Then\nturn off the heat and stir in salt to taste.\n\n\n   &QL;",

      "content": "A SMOKY PEPPER'S SEDUCTIVE POWER \n\n\n\n   Peppers release their heat in many ways, whether in a straight\ndrive like cayenne or a consuming explosion like a jalapeno. The\nAleppo pepper is more seductive, exuding a mellow, earthy warmth\nthat seems to expand rapidly, then slowly dissipate.\n\n\n   When sprinkled over roasted potatoes, the deep red waxy flakes\nof the Aleppo, a pepper that comes from Syria, do not just add\nflavor; they change the potatoes. Behind their pure nutty flavor,\nthere is smokiness and a little spice. With carrots, the pepper\nunderlines the vegetable's sweetness with its own raisin-like taste\n_ and that lingering heat. It is like paprika, but much more\ncomplex.\n\n\n   Aleppo refers to red peppers in the capsicum family that are\ngrown, partly dried and coarsely ground around the city of Aleppo.\nOther peppers from nearby regions look the same, but the Aleppo\nflavor is distinct, just as the flavor of prosciutto di Parma is\ndistinct from other cured pork.\n\n\n   As alluring as it is, Aleppo pepper has managed to elude most\nchefs and home cooks. Restaurants serving Syrian and other Middle\nEastern food, like Zaytoons in Brooklyn, Moustache in Greenwich\nVillage and Layla in TriBeCa, do not even use it.\n\n\n   And yet, the chefs who have discovered it can't seem to put it\ndown. Floyd Cardoz of Tabla uses Aleppo pepper in a number of\ndishes, often blended with cayenne and chilies from India and New\nMexico. Its mild, rich heat is in the pan-roasted lobster glazed\nwith Goan curry and in the tomato curry sauce served with a raviolo\nof spinach and sheep's milk ricotta. It even finds a place in a\nwarm Cheddar fondue with cumin.\n\n\n   Joyce Goldstein, a San Francisco chef who has written cookbooks,\nis another devotee of Aleppo pepper, and like Cardoz, she is not a\npurist about it. She often simply uses it in place of other dried\nred peppers for a richer, smokier aroma.\n\n\n   ``Anytime you have the choice of using hot paprika or a\npaprika-cayenne combination, that's the time to use it,'' she said.\n\n\n   Aleppo pepper is sold in most good spice shops, like Adriana's\nBazaar at Grand Central Market, (800) 316-0820, and Kalustyans, 123\nLexington Avenue, (212) 685-3416. It is also sold online at\nwww.worldspice.com. The price is usually around $2 an ounce.\n\n\n   A similar pepper called Maras comes from just over the border in\nTurkey. It looks the same as the Aleppo _ bright red, flaked and\nmoist from a small addition of salt _ but is a tad hotter. Urfa,\nalso from Turkey, is darker and smokier, with a deeper, dried-fruit\naroma. Sometimes these peppers are not even packaged with specific\nnames. Maras and Aleppo may simply be labeled Middle Eastern\npepper.\n\n\n   Aleppo is used in a spread called muhammara, in which the coarse\npowder is diluted in oil and water, then mixed with bread crumbs,\nground walnuts, lemon juice and pomegranate syrup, and eaten like\nhummus, with flatbread. It is also used to season meat fillings,\nlegumes and salads.\n\n\n   But you can use it like any other dried red pepper. It can be\nsprinkled over sweet potatoes with a little coarse sea salt and\nolive oil before roasting them. Aleppo blends well with other\nspices, too, like toasted and ground cumin and coriander for\ncoating pieces of carrot before roasting or braising. The light,\nthin flakes cling well to vegetables, fish and meats and work well\nwith other spices as rubs or in marinades.\n\n\n   Aleppo's sweetness and soft heat is especially good with sweet\nvegetables like tomatoes and eggplant. One way to see this is to\nchar eggplants and puree them while warm with garlic, olive oil and\nlemon juice, adding a touch of Aleppo at the end. The pepper\nunderscores the smokiness of the eggplant.\n\n\n   As Cardoz points out, Aleppo has one quality that few other\ndried red peppers have: you can add it to a finished dish and not\nworry about the sharpness overwhelming it. ``If you add almost any\nother chili pepper at the end of cooking, it hits you in the\nthroat,'' he said.\n\n\n   Aleppo has a roasted, finished flavor, so you can simmer white\nbeans with onion, garlic and herbs, then",

      "content": "WILL THE 2000 BUG GOBBLE THE VEGGIES? \n\n\n\n   Tom Johns, the president of the Territorial Seed Co., has no\nidea whether the millennium bug, a k a Y2K, is ``overblown fiction\nor a real problem.'' But that did not stop him from warning about\npossible Y2K disruptions in the catalog that Territorial recently\nmailed to 650,000 gardeners.\n\n\n   In the catalog, Johns reminded his customers of the alarm that\nsome gardeners felt last year after the Johns Hopkins School of\nMedicine announced that broccoli sprouts contain high levels of\nsulforaphane, a cancer-fighting compound. He said the announcement\nset off such a frenzy that worldwide supplies of open-pollinated\nvarieties of broccoli seed that reproduce similar plants generation\nafter generation were wiped out in 48 hours.\n\n\n   ``We should all learn from that experience,'' Johns concluded.\n``If in fact the millennium computer bug turns out to be real, I\ntruly believe the world's seed supply available to home gardeners\nwill be gone just as fast.''\n\n\n   Competitors say Johns is sowing Y2K hype, but there is no\ndenying that he is harvesting a once-in-a-lifetime marketing\nopportunity. Polls reveal that tens of millions of Y2K-leery\nAmericans fear that computers could break down frequently enough\nduring the transition to the year 2000 to cause big disruptions in\nthe global economy. Hard-core alarmists fear there will be limited\nsupplies of seed for next year's crops. But the ranks of the\nworried also include a larger group of gardeners who plan to grow\nvegetables this year as a hedge against breakdowns in deliveries of\nfood to stores.\n\n\n   Territorial's response is the $99.50 Millennium Victory Garden,\na mix of 47 vegetable seeds. It is the most popular item in the new\ncatalog, Johns said, and on a pace to become the most popular\noffering in the company's 20-year history.\n\n\n   To some seed dealers, Territorial's assertions are farfetched at\nbest. Lana Baker, the vegetable seed specialist at Molbak's Seattle\nGarden Center in Washington, which claims to stock the largest\nvariety of vegetable seeds of any retailer in the world, said\nMolbak's never had a problem getting the type of broccoli seed that\nJohns contends was wiped out. Besides, she said, ``it's extreme to\nsuggest that people will run out of seed because of Y2K.''\n\n\n   In any case, Molbak's sales are up, too, as are those of\nindustry giants like W. Atlee Burpee in Warminster, Pa. Some\nvendors, like Ferry-Morse Seed Co. in Fulton, Ky., say that sales\nhave not yet jumped significantly but that salespeople in the field\nare reporting requests from retailers to be ready to ship extra\nseed quickly.\n\n\n   ``We never thought people would plant more vegetables as a hedge\nagainst the year 2000, but we are definitely seeing a millennium\neffect,'' said Donald Zeidler, direct marketing manager at Burpee.\n\n\n   Others on the home-grown food chain are also feeling the\neffects. The Wisconsin Aluminum Foundry in Manitowoc, Wis., a maker\nof pressurized home-canning equipment, has seen its sales double in\nthe last year.\n\n\n   If the demand lasts, vegetable gardening may reverse a long-term\ndecline. Just over 20 percent of American households grew\nvegetables in 1997, according to the National Gardening Association\nin Burlington, Vt. That's down from 49 percent in 1975, the\npost-World War II peak, when many Americans were growing food in\nresponse to inflation in food prices.\n\n\n   Although flower gardening remains popular, more and more growers\nof edible gardens have thrown in their trowels. As more homemakers\nmoved into the job market and wide varieties of relatively\ninexpensive vegetables became available year round, vegetable\ngardeners found it hard to justify the investment _ until the year\n2000 threat arose.\n\n\n   ``We had become spoiled shopping at the local supermarket,''\nsaid Don Landis, 50, an airline cargo handler who lives in suburban\nSeattle. But concerns over the year 2000 bug convinced him and his\nwife to return to backyard vegetable gardening for the first time\nin 10 years. ``If this turns out to be a non-event,'' he said,\n``the food ba",

      "content": "THREE-BEAN SALAD \n\n\n\n   I've named this salad after those crocks of marinated green\nbeans, garbanzo and kidney beans in every American salad bar. But\nmy three-bean salad is really something entirely different, a\nsimple composition of dried beans and fresh beans: a base of pureed\nwhite beans is infused with truffle oil, topped with a mixture of\nfresh beans in a vinaigrette and finished with field greens or\nfresh herbs.\n\n\n   The key to success is your bean technique. Dried beans must be\nproperly rehydrated and then gently simmered, never boiled. If you\nboil the heck out of beans, they tend to explode. Soaking them in\nwarm water and then gradually bringing the cooking liquid up to a\ngentle heat insures even cooking and intact beans. Add salt toward\nthe end of cooking rather than at the beginning, or it will inhibit\nrehydration.\n\n\n   The salad works well with any fresh beans _ Blue Lake, haricots\nverts, yellow wax, fava, lima or cranberry beans, to name some\npossibilities _ cooked until they are firm but give no resistance\nto the teeth. To cook fresh beans _ or any green vegetable, for\nthat matter _ I use a technique I call big-pot blanching: cook your\nvegetable in so much water that the water does not lose its boil\nwhen you add the vegetables. Your water should be heavily salted,\nabout a half cup for each gallon. The result is a vegetable of the\nbrightest possible color.\n\n\n   If you've cooked your beans properly, you almost can't go wrong\nwith this salad.

      "content": "The vegetables are loaded not just with useful fiber and\nvitamins (A and C), but they've got phytochemicals, sulforaphane,\nindoles _ all compounds that are believed to fight everything from\ncolon and breast cancer to Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\n   So if broccoli, cauliflower and their various cousins in the\nvegetable patch are life-enhancers, are they even more so when\ngrown organically?\n\n\n   Yes, according to the people at Warren Weber's Star Route Farm\nin Bolinas. They believe their organic crops are not only healthier\nbut that they taste better than their conventionally grown\ncounterparts.\n\n\n   ``That's what customers tell us,'' says production manager\nDouglas Gallagher.\n\n\n   The consumer feedback is an advantage of entering the farmers'\nmarket business, which the 25-year-old Star Route Farm did this\nyear, making its products more widely available to consumers who\nincreasingly ask for organic produce.\n\n\n   Fifteen years ago, Gallagher says, Star Route's 40 acres _\nsupplemented by twice that acreage at its satellite farm in the\nCoachella Valley of Southern California _ would have been\nconsidered large for an organic operation. Now, he says, the\noperation is small fish in an expanding pond, as many large-scale\nfarms jump on the organic bandwagon.\n\n\n   The reasons include greater consumer awareness as well as the\ndevelopment of natural pest-fighting products and fertilizers,\nwhich can be applied with conventional machinery. ``You don't have\nto make your own compost any more,'' Gallagher points out.\n\n\n   Still, Star Route relies heavily on a natural crop cycle to\nmaintain its soil and guarantee healthy and plentiful future crops.\nAs soon as the last broccoli and cauliflower are harvested _ in a\nfew more weeks _ the Bolinas fields will be planted with clover and\nother cover crops that get plowed under in the spring. Star Route's\nrestaurant and retail customers will then receive essentially the\nsame crops (broccoli, lettuces, herbs, flowers and root vegetables)\nfrom the Coachella Valley farm, which, in turn, converts to cover\ncrops for the hot summer months.\n\n\n   Gallagher says Star Route's location on a flood plain is ideal\nfor cool-weather lovers like broccoli. The heavy soil (technically,\nblucher loam) isn't well suited for root vegetables, but the\ncrucifers thrive here from spring to fall _ even into mid-winter if\nit's a dry year.\n\n\n   Competition from large farms that have switched to organic\npractices _ some as far away as Arizona and Mexico _ may benefit\nconsumers by driving prices down, but it's obviously a concern for\nsmall operations.\n\n\n   Weber and Gallagher are part of a group of west Marin growers\nwho are working with the county's Agricultural Commissioner's\nOffice to create a Marin organic label to promote the use of\nlocally grown produce.\n\n\n   Support from trend-setting restaurateurs who want their produce\nnot only fresh and natural but locally grown if at all feasible, is\na boon to farms like Star Route. Plus, it helps to be virtually in\nthe backyard of a metropolis.\n\n\n   ``We can drive to Ferry Plaza (site of a Saturday farmers'\nmarket) in an hour,'' says Gallagher, so the distance, and time,\nfrom field to table are about as short as they can get.",

That's why 65,000 to 70,000 locals annually\nwind their way to the Auditorium Shores of Town Lake for the Austin\nSymphony's Fourth of July celebration.\n\n\n   It's a fun family/friends venue. It's red, white and fireworks.\nFood and music, too.\n\n\n   Peggy Gunn, whose family has celebrated the Fourth this way for\nmore than a decade, traditionally spreads her red and white quilt\nover the grassy banks and serves a picnic for six to 12 people.\n``I've got a sister from North Carolina coming this year, who is\nbringing her 12-year-old daughter.'' Add to that her husband, two\ngrown daughters, and local friends bringing young children, who\nalways add magic to the evening, and the quilt fills up.\n\n\n   Gunn likes it that way. The best relationships are built around\nthe dinner table or picnicking on quilts, says the Southern-born\nhostess, who, while rearing her children, always kept a picnic\nbasket packed for impromptu family outings.\n\n\n   Her Fourth of July menu varies each year, with the exception of\nthe mandatory deviled eggs. This year's spread will include\ncrudites with tzatziki, marinated beef tenderloin, artichoke-rice\nsalad and spirited watermelon. All cold. All dishes that can be\nprepared ahead. In fact, the salads are better made at least two\ndays before serving.\n\n\n   Gunn likes to cook and spread a menu of dishes with family\nmeaning, but other revelers opt for take-out.\n\n\n   ``I don't ever prepare the food myself,'' says Jeani\nSandefer-Smith, who has been July Fourthpicnicking on Auditorium\nShores since 1976. ``I go to Whole Foods or Central Market and get\ncool stuff.'' Melons, Greek salad, shrimp cocktail, tarragon\nchicken salad, cold pastas, French bread and always some kind of\nsinful individual desserts such as tortes loaded with cherries and\nwhipped cream.\n\n\n   She packs everything in a large ice chest with wheels, attaching\nother items to the cooler with a bungee cord so nothing has to be\ncarried. Arriving at the picnic site about 5:30 p.m. to get her\nfavorite spot, she puts down a canvas first, then a blanket,\nstaking the corners with small flags and making it easier for the\ndozen or so family and friends to find the spot.\n\n\n   If the summer keeps up its heat wave, there is no question that\nit will be a hot time in the old town on July Fourth. But cannons\nwill boom, as the Symphony's new music director Peter Bay directs\nTchaikovsky's 1812 Overture. Rockets will flare, as fireworks have\ntheir 15 minutes of fame in the Austin skies.

Shangyi, a county in\nnorthern Hebei Province, is now making a good living by providing\na large amount of vegetables to other parts of the country and\neven selling some abroad.\n\n\nIn 1995, Shangyi sold 50 million kg of vegetables to Beijing,\nTianjin Municipality, and Zhangjiakou City in Hebei, as well as to\nRussia and Mongolia.\n\n\nFor those who live in places with more favorable conditions,\nthese figures don't sound like much. But for farmers in Shangyi,\nwhich is in north China, on the edge of the Mongolian Highlands,\nwith its cold weather and poor economy, it means a not\ninsignificant move historically.\n\n\nFor decades, local farmers led poor lives, with only potatoes\nand oats as their staple food, and very little in the way of\nvegetables and meat.\n\n\nIn 1992, Pan Yonghe, a farmer in Dayingzi Village, became the\nfirst in the county to engage in commercial vegetable growing when\nhe spent 2,000 yuan to open a small vegetable plot covered with\nplastic sheeting as he had learned from local agronomists from the\ncounty-seat.\n\n\nFor people in this poverty-stricken county, 2,000 yuan meant 10\nyears of savings, and it was all Pan had, and was money he had\nsaved to build his dream house.\n\n\nThe move turned out to be a big success. In the first year, Pan\nearned 7,000 yuan from his vegetable plot, growing celery,\ntomatoes, and cabbage. The tale of Pan's success encouraged the\nvillagers to follow suit.\n\n\nThe county leaders, who had been looking for a way to help\nlocal farmers become affluent, came to see the unique advantages\nof the county in growing vegetables. Shangyi county is\nagricultural-based and has less industrial pollution, and urban\nresidents are eager to buy organic, or \"clean vegetables\", from\nplaces like Shangyi.\n\n\nOver the past few years, local officials and scientists have\nput a great deal of effort into getting more local farmers into\nthe vegetable business by means of preferential policies and\nbringing in more scientists. They have also sent salesmen across\nChina, especially to big cities, to market their products.\n\n\nUrban residents in an increasing number of cities are getting\nacquainted with Shangyi's produce, as are foreign markets.\n\n\nVegetables have brought cash to this underdeveloped county and\nits 180,000 people.\n\n\nBy 1995, 8,500 rural families no longer had to worry about\ntheir food and clothing, and some 2,000 households became\nwell-off, thanks to the revolutionary changes that had been\nbrought about.\n\n\nThis year, locals invested 1.36 million yuan in vegetable\nproduction, with acreage increased to 4,000 ha., including 413\nha. of green-houses and plastic-covered plots.\n\n\nAccording to Qiao, the county is trying to expand vegetable\nproduction, but also plans to introduce investment from other\nparts of the country or overseas to set up a vegetable processing\nbusiness to produce dried or canned vegetables.\n\n\n\"I believe that more Chinese and foreigners will develop a\ntaste for vegetables produced here,\" Qiao concluded.",

      "content": "&HT;   \n\n\n\n   Now that Halloween is safely behind us, some people will no\ndoubt go back to letting themselves be frightened by underarm\nantiperspirants, irradiated food and spiders in the toilet. Those\nare only a few of the popular health scares that are actually no\nmore dangerous than a skeleton mask.\n\n\n   There will be bogus health scares as long as there is money to\nbe made off frightened people by removing their dental fillings or\nselling them gizmos to eradicate dust mites, and the Internet\ncirculates those scares faster than ever. Other groundless alarms\nwill always be motivated less by greed than by ignorance,\ngullibility or the sheer enjoyment of seeing people become\nhysterical.\n\n\n   That second category includes sincere phobias that power lines\nand antiperspirants cause cancer, which science has refuted\nrepeatedly. And of eating genetically modified food, which prompts\nDNA co-discoverer James Watson to say, ``I am worried about a lot\nof things, but not about modified food.'' And of food irradiation,\nwhich is proven to substantially reduce such foodborne infections\nas E. coli without raising radiation levels.\n\n\n   And of pesticides for fruit and vegetables, which three of four\nAmericans believe increase their chances of cancer. The American\nInstitute for Cancer Research not only has found no evidence to\nthat effect but also has warned that the fear is causing people to\navoid fruits and vegetables that can reduce their chances of\ncancer.\n\n\n   Science doesn't know everything, certainly, but frights often\ndistract us from real risks that we can avoid. There's evidence to\nsuspect cell phones might cause brain tumors, for example, but no\nconclusive proof. Using headsets is a sensible precaution. But an\neven better argument for headsets is there's no doubt about the\nconnection between cell phones and car accidents.\n\n\n   Then there are the outright hoaxes so easily circulated by\ne-mail. Waterproof sunscreens do not cause blindness, the sodium\nlaureth sulfate in shampoo does not cause cancer and three women in\nChicago did not die mysteriously after being bitten by spiders in a\npublic restroom, according to the authoritative Internet hoax Web\nsite, urbanlegends.about.com _ which currently is stressing that\nMountain Dew is not an effective contraceptive for males who drink\nit.\n\n\n   David Emery of About.com points out how the spider hoax e-mail\ntypically debunks itself. It refers to the nonexistent United\nMedical Association and Blare Airport and Big Chappies restaurant\nin Chicago.\n\n\n   Deceptive sales pitches are harder to spot, but it helps to ask\nwhat's in it for whoever is spreading the news. As soon as word\ncame out that chocolate contains cancer-fighting antioxidants\nsimilar to vitamins C and E, the Mars company promoted a Web site\ndedicated to timely information ``on chocolate and health.''\n\n\n   As consumer scams go, that was hardly more deceptive than ending\nprice tags with ``.99.'' The Federal Trade Commission (FTC)\nannounced this summer that after one day's research, it told 800\nWeb sites their false or unsubstantiated health claims broke\nfederal laws.\n\n\n   Beware, says the FTC, of broad claims, big words, testimonials\ninstead of scientific research, products available from only one\nsource and the terms ``scientific breakthrough'' or ``ancient\nremedy.'' When you hear something can't hurt you because it's\nnatural, remember arsenic is natural.\n\n\n   The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) says the most fertile\nfields for health fraud are products to treat arthritis, cancer and\nAIDS; to help people lose weight quickly or improve their sex\nlives, and to reverse baldness, eliminate wrinkles and enlarge\nbreasts.\n\n\n   The Web site www.quackwatch.com is the most comprehensive\nresource on health frauds and how to spot them, although it tends\nto give all alternative remedies the dismissal that only most of\nthem deserve.\n\n\n   WellnessWeb.com is more open-minded about classical medicine\nwithout opening its arms in embrace, pointing out that just because\nsomething is not proven doesn't mean it can't be true. It wasn't\nlong ag",

      "content": "&HT;   \n\n\n\n   AUSTIN, Texas _ It's the classic dad dilemma.\n\n\n   Father's Day is less than 96 hours away, and millions of\noffspring are facing the big dinner question: Do you give Dad\nsomething he thinks tastes good (like a juicy ol' rib dripping in\nbarbecue sauce and fat) or something you think is good for him\n(perhaps a small salad, with grilled fruits and vegetables)?\n\n\n   It's a tug-of-war between taste and health that extends far\nbeyond this weekend when children want to pamper Dad. This is a\nthree-meals-a-day, every-day-of-the-year issue: achieving a balance\namong food choices that run the gamut on the scale of healthy\neating.\n\n\n   So what's a foodie to do?\n\n\n   One option is to follow the path of Steven Raichlen, the author\nof ``The Barbecue! Bible'' and ``Healthy Latin Cooking,'' which\nboth won prestigious national cookbook awards this year.\n\n\n   Raichlen will dive into a heavy plate of sausage, ribs, pork and\nbrisket with the best of them, as he did one recent noon hour at\nthe Iron Works Barbecue in downtown Austin. Then he'll turn around\nand prepare a light grilled shrimp for dinner, as he did that night\nat Central Market Cooking School.\n\n\n   The key for Raichlen is moderation (he didn't eat every ounce of\nthat heaping plate) and intense flavors (whether it's barbecue or\nlow-fat cooking).\n\n\n   And turning on the grill.\n\n\n   ``In general, grilling is a healthy cooking method,'' says\nRaichlen, his head tilted, mouth poised above a beef rib that spans\nhis face ear to ear. Grilling is a healthy cooking technique, he\nsays, because ``there is little added fat.''\n\n\n   Grilling also is something Texans endorse enthusiastically.\n\n\n   ``Texas,'' Raichlen says, ``is a major epicenter of the two\nbiggest food trends happening in North America right now _ the\nLatinization of the American diet and America going up in flames\nwith barbecue and grilling.''\n\n\n   ``Grilling is wonderful,'' says Alexa Sparkman, a registered\ndietitian in private practice in Austin. She contends that the\nright grilled fish _ such as swordfish or shark _ can taste like a\nbeef steak if prepared well.\n\n\n   If Dad still is determined to dine on beef, Sparkman suggests a\nsmall tenderloin steak in the 4-ounce range. But first, she says,\ntrim all the visible fat and discard the bacon that wraps many of\nthem before tossing it on the grill. If the steak pushes 6 ounces,\nwhich Sparkman says is a whole day's worth of protein, then Dad\nshould balance it with smaller, lighter meals the rest of the day.\n\n\n   The point, she says, is moderation. In her practice, she tries\nto help people find a middle-of-the-road place to begin a healthier\nlifestyle. ``Extremes seldom work more than a few weeks,'' she\nsays.\n\n\n   She also emphasizes portion control and flavorful ingredients,\nsuch as salsas and pepper sauces, to give spark to meat and\nvegetables. With balance and moderation, she says, people don't\nhave to give up their favorite foods in order to eat healthy.\n\n\n   ``I'm not sure life would be worth living without barbecue or\nchocolate,'' Sparkman says. ``It's portion control, portion\ncontrol, portion control.''\n\n\n   That's a mantra echoed by Raichlen.\n\n\n   He says the traditional Argentinian grill plate, which is 95\npercent meat, is enough to give the typical North American\ncardiologist a heart attack. Instead of replicating that, he\nsuggests using a small amount of meat on the plate and filling up\nthe rest with vegetables and other low-fat items.\n\n\n   ``Use meat as the accent flavor, rather than the focus of the\nplate,'' he says.\n\n\n   That technique, says Dr. Jim Goolsby, a cardiologist with Austin\nHeart, would help solve one of the major dietary problems in the\nUnited States.\n\n\n   People eat too much fat, Goolsby says. He recommends a diet\nconcentrating on fish, poultry, fruit and vegetables, while\nminimizing red meat and desserts. Still, that doesn't mean Dad has\nto abandon steak altogether.\n\n\n   ``Is having steak on Father's Day criminal? No. But we hope to\nachieve a life of balance and moderation,'' says Goolsby, a bird\nhunter whose ideal meal includes smoked qu",

      "content": "BRET HELPS THE GULF COAST GET IN SHIPSHAPE \n\n\n\n\n   CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas _ At his baitshop beneath the John F.\nKennedy Causeway, Wilbert Gohlke and his wife scrubbed out bait\ntanks they hope will soon be brimming with shrimp.\n\n\n   Gohlke, 70 and a veteran of four decades of wresting a living\nfrom the bays behind Clem's Marina, has a hunch Hurricane Bret did\nthe Texas coast a favor.\n\n\n   ``Fishing and shrimping is good after a storm. I think all the\nwater that comes in from the Gulf of Mexico, it's good. It cleans\nout all the dead water,'' said Gohlke.\n\n\n   Some of the state's top marine scientists predict Bret's massive\ninfusion of freshwater will bring long-term, beneficial effects to\nSouth Texas bay systems normally closed off from freshwater and\nsaltwater inflows. The flushing of the bays will mean more than\njust better sport fishing. Experts say a whole marine ecosystem of\ninterdependent species, ranging from invisible plankton to ungainly\nbrown pelicans, will be helped.\n\n\n   And the pesky brown tide, which has plagued Texas bays for\nnearly a decade, may have been flushed away.\n\n\n   But perhaps the most dramatic effect of the storm can be seen on\nbeaches along the Gulf of Mexico. Bret's storm surge carved open 12\nnew channels through the barrier islands along the Gulf from Port\nIsabel to Corpus Christi, allowing huge quantities of fresh sea\nwater to flood the bays.\n\n\n   ``Anytime you have a big storm event like this one _ and this\nstorm Bret went right through the center of the Laguna Madre,\ndumped a lot of water, raised the tides to very high levels _ it\nhas a big effect on the flushing of the Laguna Madre,'' said Ken\nDunton, an associate professor at the University of Texas Marine\nScience Institute at Port Aransas.\n\n\n   Dunton, an expert in sea grass and coastal marshes, expects new\nand expanded growth of three of the five species of sea grass,\nwhich serve as a nursery for shrimp, crabs and fish. Those grasses\n_ shoal grass, manatee grass and wigeon grass _ are also an\nimportant food source for millions of ducks that winter in Texas\nbays.\n\n\n   ``The long-term benefits of increased freshwater inflows through\na major event such as a hurricane to Texas estuaries far outweigh\nthe short-term, negative effects. Long-term, you'll see increased\nhabitat utilization by commercially important species of finfish\nand shellfish,'' including shrimp, blue crabs, trout, redfish and\nblack drum, Dunton said.\n\n\n   One of the immediate short-term concerns is the heavy runoff\nfrom farm lands, which means increased nitrates that promote algae\nblooms such as brown tide. Other concerns are that larval marine\nlife could have been flushed out of protective bays into the Gulf;\nsea grass could be covered in silt in areas near the new channels.\n\n\n   When Bret moved ashore late Sunday, huge quantities of rainwater\nwere dumped directly into a number of South Texas bays with\nrelatively high salt levels, rapidly lowering their salinity. As\nthe storm moved inland, additional freshwater poured into the bays\nafter draining into creeks, sloughs and rivers that form the\nwatershed for the lower Laguna Madre, Baffin Bay, the Nueces\nestuary _ which includes Corpus Christi Bay, Nueces Bay and Redfish\nBay _ and the Aransas estuary.\n\n\n   ``What that means is when you flush the system like that, you're\ncarrying away a lot of material in the Laguna Madre that has been\nsitting there decaying for a long time, dead sea grasses and\nvegetation that has been rotting, and you're revitalizing the\nsystem,'' said Dunton, who has been studying the bay system for the\nlast 13 years.\n\n\n   ``You're exposing substrates, or (bottom) areas that have not\nbeen exposed for a while, providing perhaps new opportunity for sea\ngrass growth or growth expansion, through the removal of this dead\nand decaying material.''\n\n\n   Late last week, state wildlife biologists and officials from the\nTexas General Land Office were preparing to take aerial photographs\nof Gulf beaches where Bret cut a dozen new channels above and below\nthe Port Mansfield cut, which divides North and South Padre Isla",

Such violations require\nimmediate action to prevent the spread of foodborne illnesses such\nas E. coli, salmonella or hepatitis A.\n\n\n   In 1996, government officials took action to correct similar\nproblems at the Kingdome when it was revealed that the Dome's food\nvendor, Ogden Entertainment, had been cited with 158 red critical\nviolations over a three-year period. Volume Services at Safeco\nField has acquired 50 such violations in the space of one week.\n\n\n   New York-based Ogden recently announced plans to acquire Volume\nServices.\n\n\n   Seven of the 26 violations identified Thursday at Safeco Field\nwere in stands or kiosks that already had been cited Monday. The\nhealth department operates a ``three strikes and you're out''\npolicy in food safety, and will temporarily close down vendors who\nviolate the rule within a year's time.\n\n\n   In addition to the red critical violations found among food\nhandlers inside the Mariners' stadium Thursday, food inspectors\ntemporarily closed down two outdoor food carts for lack of\nhand-washing facilities. One concession stand's improperly prepared\nfood was destroyed.\n\n\n   ``Volume Services America and the Mariners must resolve these\nproblems immediately,'' Plough said, or else the department ``will\ntake all necessary actions in order to protect the public health.''\n\n\n   The Mariners on Friday issued a detailed plan in response to the\nsecond round of food safety violations aimed at achieving 100\npercent compliance.\n\n\n   In addition to Volume Services hiring a full-time food safety\nexpert, and the Mariners' promise to assign someone to oversee\nVolume Services, the Mariners announced that all food workers will\nbe required to complete a more ``stringent and comprehensive food\nsafety program'' before the next homestand begins.\n\n\n   The program is called ServSafe and is offered by the National\nRestaurant Association, Richner said.\n\n\n   Asked what kind of training the food workers had received before\nworking at Safeco Field, Volume Services' Richner said she wasn't\ncertain but everyone had at least received the minimum training\nrequired to be certified by the health department.",

Small neighborhood spots have become destinations,\nand splashier high-profile places have attracted diners in ever\nincreasing numbers.\n\n   But what's made this explosion of restaurants even more\nsignificant is the talent behind them _ the people in the kitchen\nwho turn out food that wows our palates and keeps us coming back\nfor more.\n\n\n   They're not just the big names. Peeking behind the stoves, the\nFood staff has uncovered five especially talented young chefs who\nwe bet will soon emerge as stars in their own right.\n\n\n   Some have formal training; some don't. Their styles range from\nstraightforward and subtle to inventive and cross-cultural. But all\nof them infuse their cooking with a love for what they do, and the\nskills to excel at it.\n\n\n   Their passion is on the plate _ and we're all the luckier for\nit.\n\n\n   &QL; \n &UR; ALEXANDER ONG &LR;\n\n\n   &UR; By Karola Saekel &QL;  &LR; \n &UR; c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle &LR;\n\n\n   If Alexander Ong's classic culinary training needed to be honed\nto a razor's edge, he got his chance in Florida, when the\nRitz-Carlton organization made him a 911 chef.\n\n\n   Like a paramedic, the 911 chef rushes off at a moment's notice\nto rescue a kitchen in dire need: When a sous chef is hospitalized\nwith bleeding ulcers, another is thrown in the slammer after an\naltercation in a bar, or yet another walks out in a huff on the eve\nof a convention. Pinch-hitting in these situations is a challenge,\nOng admits.\n\n\n   It's not a life Ong would have liked to live forever, but ``it\nwas a chance to learn a lot about how America works and see a good\npart of the country for a single guy.'' (He has since married\nKimberly Norton, whom he met in Florida and who is now his pastry\nchef.)\n\n\n   Ong already had a handle on how hotel kitchens work in other\nparts of the world. The son of a professional couple in Malaysia,\nhe wasn't interested in an academic career. After graduating from a\nCatholic high school, he headed for Kuala Lumpur and a job as a\nbanquet server at the huge Shangri-La Hotel. His ambition was to\nget into the ``controlled chaos'' of the 600-cook kitchen. The chef\nfinally gave in to his pleadings and told the 17-year-old to report\nto the kitchen the next morning.\n\n\n   ``I got myself properly outfitted in chef's whites,'' Ong\nrecallstells &LR;  with a grin. ``The chef took one look at me and said,\n`Now get out of that uniform and put on a dishwasher's shirt.' It\nwas humbling, but I wasn't about to give up.''\n\n\n   Co-workers couldn't understand why a son of the middle class\nwould want to be a menial laborer. `` `You could work in a nice\noffice,' they used to tell me.'' But he persisted. Three months\nlater, when a prep cook left, he got his chance.\n\n\n   From then on Ong's career has spiraled ever upwards. Wanting to\nwork in the United States but not being able to obtain a visa _\n``it's not like high-tech workers; cooks are a dime a dozen'' _ he\nsettled for a position in Bermuda. It wasn't a bad life _ good pay\nundiminished by taxes, no rent and free food. With a British\nCommonwealth passport, ``We could fly to New York in the morning,\nshop in Chinatown, have two lunches and be back in our dormitory by\nnight.''\n\n\n   But the work was uninspiring _ ``three-bean salad straight from\nthe can,'' he explains with a comic little shudder _ so he jumped\nat an offer from the Atlanta Ritz-Carlton, later transferring to\nFlorida.\n\n\n   Always looking for new challenges, there followed stints at\nCaesar's Tahoe, Orocco East-West Supper Club in San Francisco's\nRichmond District, in friend Chris Yeo's Straits Cafe, at Stars and\nbriefly as opening chef at Le Colonial.\n\n\n   When longtime acquaintance, restaurant entrepreneur George Chen\n(who owns Betelnut, Shanghai 1930, Long Life Noodle Co.), invited\nhim into a new venture, Xanadu, he saw new opportunities.
