A number of \nemployees have been prosecuted, including three senior ADM \nexecutives who were sentenced to prison in July. \n\n\n\tAll four companies also settled civil suits by bottlers and  \nprocessors. \n\n\n\tBut Cargill, based in Minneapolis, insisted it had no part in  \nany conspiracy and simply followed a common practice of basing its \nprices on those of its competitors. \n\n\n\tCitric acid, with worldwide sales of $2 billion to $3 billion a  \nyear, is used to extend the shelf life of soft drinks, canned \nfruits and vegetables, detergents, drugs and cosmetics. \n\n\n\tThe four companies admitted agreeing between 1991 and 1995 to  \ndivide the market and raise prices by limiting sales. \n\n\n\tCargill entered the market in the late 1980s and gained a 20  \npercent U.S. share by the mid-1990s. \n\n\n\tThe suit, a class action by Varni Brothers Corp. and the 7-Up  \nBottling Co. of Philadelphia, accused Cargill of joining the \nconspiracy in 1993 when it joined the European Citric Acid \nManufacturers Association, a group to which the other four \ncompanies belonged. \n\n\n\tThe suit noted that Cargill had announced in early 1992 that it  \nplanned to double its citric acid production capacity but announced \nin late 1992 that it would increase capacity only 50 percent. The \nsuit also cited an FBI report in one of the criminal cases that \nquoted Barrie Cox, an ADM employee, as saying he had frequent \ndiscussions with Cargill's national sales director about citric \nacid bidding prices in 1995. \n\n\n\tBut the appeals court largely discounted Cox's statements,  \nsaying they showed, at most, ``sporadic price discussions'' two \nyears after Cargill was alleged to have joined the conspiracy. \n\n\n\tCargill's scaling back of its expansion plans, and its posting  \nof prices that largely mirrored those of its competitors, were not \nevidence of a conspiracy, said Judge Diarmuid O'Scannlain in the \n3-0 ruling. He said Cargill's expansion of its U.S. market share \ncame largely at the expense of ADM and Haarman &AMP; Reimer. \n\n\n\tOf the companies that admitted fixing prices, ``none identified  \nCargill as a co-conspirator,'' O'Scannlain said. \n\n\n\tTherese Stewart, a lawyer for the companies that sued Cargill,  \nsaid the court disregarded an earlier antitrust decision and made \nit extremely difficult to get a price-fixing conspiracy case to \ntrial. Even ``evidence of actual agreement between an admitted \nconspirator and the defendant on certain bid prices'' isn't enough, \nshe said, referring to the FBI's statement from Cox. \n\n\n\tBut Richard Favretto, a lawyer for Cargill, said Cox's  \nstatements were never corroborated and were considered by the \nfederal government in a four-year investigation that cleared the \ncompany. \n\n\n\tThe ruling is ``a further vindication of our position,'' he  \nsaid.",

They argued that both systems involved\nallocating sales quantities to competitors, with almost identical\nmethods of reporting and auditing to insure the schemes were\nworking.\n\n\n   The three executives on trial are Michael D. Andreas, the former\nvice chairman of Archer Daniels; Terrance Wilson, the former head\nof the company's corn processing division; and Mark E. Whitacre,\nthe former head of its bioproducts division.\n\n\n   The role of Archer Daniels in fixing prices of the food additive\nwas no surprise _ the company pleaded guilty in 1996 to conspiring\nto rig both the prices of citric acid and lysine. And Cox offered\ntestimony about citric acid to the government that year as part of\na deal to reduce Archer Daniels' fine, which was eventually set at\n$100 million.\n\n\n   In his testimony, Cox said that Wilson took a direct role in\nfixing prices of citric acid. He said that he and Wilson traveled\nto meetings with four other European competitors, where both\nprice-fixing and volume allocation were discussed.\n\n\n   The system described by Cox was unusually detailed. The\nconspirators referred to themselves as the G-5, which stood for the\n``group of five.'' He said executives in the conspiracy were\ncharacterized as being in two categories: ``sherpas,'' who attended\nto the daily details of the scheme, and ``masters,'' who handled\nbroader strategy and planning.\n\n\n   Cox testified that the scheme began in the spring of 1991 and\nlasted through 1995. Often, he said, illegal meetings between the\ncitric acid producers were held in conjunction with official\nmeetings of a trade association, in order to provide the executives\nwith cover.\n\n\n   At one point in the conspiracy, Cox said that he had a\ndiscussion with Wilson about what would happen if the government\nlearned of the illegal scheme. He said that Wilson replied, ``If\never any of this goes wrong, you're on your own.''\n\n\n   Under cross-examination, Cox testified that he had learned\nduring his time at Archer Daniels that executives with his former\nemployer, Pfizer Inc., had held pricing discussions with\ncompetitors in the past. But he said that he was not aware of those\ndiscussions while he worked at the pharmaceutical giant.\n\n\n   Archer Daniels bought Pfizer's citric acid business in 1990.\nPfizer officials did not return telephone calls seeking comment on\nCox's testimony.",

It was, prosecutors say, the critical stage in conspiracy\nthat had lasted more than a year to fix prices of the additive.\n\n\n   And unknown to all but one man in the room at that meeting in\nOctober 1993, every word was being videotaped.\n\n\n   More than three years after government raids disclosed the\nexistence of a huge price-fixing investigation, prosecutors played\nthat videotape Monday to a federal jury that is hearing the\ncriminal price-fixing case against three former Archer Daniels\nexecutives. All three men have pleaded not guilty.\n\n\n   If the government is right in its claims, the videotape offers\nan unprecedented look into what the government contends was a\nprice-fixing conspiracy on a giant scale, involving every major\ncompany in the business of producing the additive, which is called\nlysine. It shows the executives of the two largest companies in the\nbusiness discussing how they would dictate the annual growth in\nproduction to the other lysine makers, and debating the tactical\nbenefits of simply lying to the others about certain data.\n\n\n   But the tape has already played a critical role in reshaping the\nfuture of Archer Daniels, the politically powerful grain giant. For\nit is the crucial evidence against one defendant, Michael Andreas,\nthe son and former heir apparent to the powerful company's\nchairman, Dwayne Andreas.\n\n\n   Also charged in the case are Terrance Wilson, the former head of\nthe company's corn-processing division, and Mark Whitacre, the\nformer head of its bioproducts unit, which produces lysine.\n\n\n   The government has already secured guilty pleas from some of the\nexecutives involved in the conspiracy and each of the companies;\nArcher Daniels agreed to pay $100 million in 1996 to settle\nprice-fixing charges.\n\n\n   Since the investigation was first disclosed, much of the public\nattention has focused on Whitacre, who served as a government\ninformant during the inquiry and secretly recorded his colleagues\nover more than two years. But he became a defendant in the case\nafter the government learned he had violated his cooperation\nagreement by illegally taking millions of dollars from Archer\nDaniels through a complex fraud.\n\n\n   Indeed, much of the defense centers on Whitacre. Lawyers for\nAndreas and Wilson have argued that he manipulated investigators\nand Archer Daniels officials to create evidence of a conspiracy.\nThe defense lawyers have argued that many of the conversations\ncaptured on the recordings either involve innocent business\ndiscussions or were elaborate efforts to trick Asian competitors\ninto providing information that would allow Archer Daniels to gauge\nthe size of the lysine market.\n\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n\n   But the hearing Monday focused solely on the price-fixing\nallegations that began the investigation. Early in the day,\nprosecutors played an audiotape recorded by Whitacre in 1993 during\na meeting at Archer Daniels' headquarters in Decatur, Ill., between\nsenior executives with the company and officials with Ajinimoto.\n\n\n   ``We have a saying at this company,'' James Randall, then the\npresident of Archer Daniels, told the Japanese executives. ``Our\ncompetitors are our friends and our customers are our enemies.''\n\n\n   The meeting in Irvine came some months later. According to\ntestimony in the case, efforts among the five lysine producers to\nfix prices were failing because the companies were unable to reach\nan agreeme",

The amount is part of a $6.3 million judgment. \n\n\n\tWhitacre and two other senior ADM executives were sentenced last  \nmonth in what persecutors called one of the largest antitrust \nconspiracies ever brought to court. \n\n\n\tThey were charged with conspiring with competitors in Japan and  \nKorea to fix the $600 million world market in lysine, a \nsoybean-based feed additive that promotes growth in hogs and \npoultry. \n\n\n\tIn 1996 the company pleaded guilty to price-fixing charges.  \n\n\n\tWhitacre was sentenced to 30 months in the price-fixing case.  \n\n\n\tBecause Whitacre is in prison and has multimillion-dollar  \njudgments against him, the new ruling will likely have little \neffect on him. But Whitacre's attorney said it could have an \nadverse effect on corporate whistleblowers in the future. ``It \nopens the door,'' Bill T. Walker told the Chicago Tribune in \ncomments published Wednesday. \n\n\n\tWhitacre, the former head of ADM's bioproducts division, set the  \nFBI investigation in motion by telling top executives that Japanese \nrivals were trying to sabotage the company's lysine operation. \n\n\n\tBut ADM called in federal investigators, who found no trace of  \nsabotage. Whitacre then told the government about a global \nprice-fixing conspiracy and wore a wire as an undercover informant \nat ADM.",

He is at a  \nfederal prison camp in Edgefield, S.C., serving a nine-year \nsentence for swindling ADM out of $9 million. \n\n\n\tHe and two other top ADM executives -- Michael Andreas and  \nTerrance Wilson -- were convicted in September 1998 of conspiring to \nfix the $600 million world market in lysine, a soybean-based \nadditive that promotes growth in hogs and poultry. \n\n\n\tWhitacre originally went undercover and wore a wire for  \ninvestigators but later broke with them and was accused of taking \npart in the crime he had helped to investigate. \n\n\n\t``They would have no case without me, against ADM and its  \nexecutives,'' said Whitacre in court over the phone. ``I risked my \nlife and my career for them, and I have yet to see anything.'' \n\n\n\tU.S. District Judge Blanche Manning made 10 months in his term  \nconcurrent with the term he is serving, with the additional 20 \nmonths to be served in addition. She also ordered him to \nparticipate in a mental health treatment program after his release. \n\n\n\tManning also heard arguments today from attorneys for Andreas  \nand Wilson the length of their sentences. \n\n\n\tA U.S. District Court jury convicted the three men of one count  \nof conspiring with Japanese and Korean rivals to fix the price of \nlysine and limit its production -- a criminal antitrust violation. \n\n\n\tAndreas, 49, is the son of ADM chairman emeritus Dwayne Andreas,  \nwho in the 1960s built the company into a global agribusiness \nempire. At one point, Michael Andreas was considered heir to the \ntop spot within ADM. \n\n\n\tWilson, 60, is the retired head of ADM's big corn division.  \n\n\n\tWhitacre was brought to ADM as chief of its bioproducts division  \nto lead the company into the lucrative lysine market. Producing the \nsoybean-based product requires a sophisticated technical know-how \nthat he claimed to have. \n\n\n\tIt was Whitacre who inadvertently launched the FBI investigation  \nof the food-processing giant based in Decatur by claiming Japanese \nrivals were sabotaging ADM's move into the $600 million lysine \nmarket. \n\n\n\tWhitacre asked top ADM executives for $10 million to buy off  \n``Mr. Fujiwara,'' the supposed leader of the saboteurs. Instead, \ncompany officials called in federal investigators. \n\n\n\tFBI agents could find no trace of sabotage. When FBI agents  \nasked him about his claim, Whitacre instead told them about a \nconspiracy between ADM and rival companies to fix the price of \nlysine. \n\n\n\tWhitacre wore a hidden microphone to gather evidence against his  \nfellow ADM executives. Prosecutors say the tapes show ``a ruthless \ncampaign to make its competitors its friends and treat its \ncustomers as enemies.'' \n\n\n\tAndreas attorneys insisted that the tapes contained nothing to  \nshow that their client had taken part in a price-fixing conspiracy. \n\n\n\tAttorneys for the Wilson, who is heard on tape discussing lysine  \nprices with ADM rivals, argued that he was merely playing along \nwith Asian manufacturers as they hatched a conspiracy.",

(AP) -- Tyson Foods and more than a half-dozen  \nother U.S. poultry producers filed a federal lawsuit alleging a \nworldwide conspiracy among vitamin producers to fix prices for a \npopular animal-feed supplement. \n\n\n\tThe lawsuit makes claims similar to those in a federal criminal  \ncase that resulted in a multimillion dollar settlement last week. \nIt seeks to recover threefold the wrongful costs incurred by \npoultry producers, but does not list a dollar amount. \n\n\n\t``We believe we are the largest consumer of choline cloride in  \nNorth America. As far as the actual amount we're out, we believe it \nis significant,'' Tyson general counsel Les R. Baledge said today. \nHe declined to give a damage estimate. \n\n\n\tThe lawsuit, filed Tuesday in Fayetteville, alleges that  \nGermany's BASF AG and other companies engaged in a 10-year \nconspiracy to fix, raise and stabilize the price of choline, \ncommonly known as vitamin B4, and to divide up the world market \nshare. \n\n\n\tCholine is one of a number of vitamins essential to the diets of  \npoultry. It assists in the transportation of fat from the liver and \nalso affects certain nerve functions. \n\n\n\tBASF agreed last week to plead guilty and pay $225 million in  \nfines for a worldwide price-fixing scheme involving vitamins A, B2, \nB5, C, E and Beta Carotene. Swiss pharmaceutical giant F. \nHoffman-LaRoche Ltd., also agreed to plead guilty and pay a $500 \nmillion fine. \n\n\n\tIn March, Swiss vitamin manufacturer Lonza AG and five U.S.  \nexecutives also agreed to plead guilty in a worldwide vitamin \nprice-fixing conspiracy. Lonza, which is to pay a $10.5 million \nfine, was charged in a scheme for vitamin B3. The five executives \nwere charged with plotting to fix prices and allocate customers and \nsales of vitamin B4. \n\n\n\t``This is the civil side of the justice department's criminal  \nindictment,'' said Fayetteville lawyer John Elrod, representing \npoultry producers Simmons Food Inc. and Peterson Farms Inc. ``We're \ntracking on the civil side on behalf of the people who lost \nmoney.'' \n\n\n\tThe lawsuit contends a conspiracy existed from at least January  \n1988 through September 1998 among companies involved in producing \nand distributing the food supplement. \n\n\n\tThe lawsuit alleges that the companies agreed to allocate  \ncustomers, then either refrained from submitting bids or submitted \ncollusive, non-competitive or rigged bids to supply choline. \n\n\n\t``The intended result of this conduct was to leave the customer  \nwith only one non-competitive bid from which to choose, and to \nforce the customer to purchase choline at the seller's inflated \nprice,'' according to the lawsuit. \n\n\n\tAs a result of the conspiracy, the price of choline was 60 to  \n100 percent higher than the prices before and after the conspiracy, \nthe lawsuit said. \n\n\n\tThe lawsuit contends that the North American market was divided  \nand allocated to Bioproducts Inc. of Akron, Ohio; Highland, \nIll.-based DuCoa, which was a partnership operated by E.I. Dupont \nde Nemours Inc. and ConAgra Inc.; and the Chinook Group, \nheadquartered in Toronto, Canada. \n\n\n\tEuropean markets, according to the lawsuit, were divided among  \nBASF; Azko Nobel Inc. of the Netherlands; and UCB SA of Belgium. \n\n\n\tOthers named in the lawsuit include Japan-based Mitsui and Co.  \nand affiliates of the various companies. \n\n\n\tIn addition to the antitrust violations alleged in the suit, it  \naccuses the defendants of trying to fraudulently conceal their \nanti-competitive acts. \n\n\n\tPlaintiffs include Springdale-based Tyson; Allens Hatchery Inc.  \nof Seaford, Del.; Chocktaw Maid Farms Inc. of Carthage, Miss.; \nGeorges Inc. of Springdale and its affiliates; Hudson Foods Inc., \nwhich was bought last year by Tyson; OK Industries Inc. of Fort \nSmith; Peterson, based in Decatur; Simmons, based in Siloam \nSprings; Sunshine Mills Inc. of Red Bay, Ala.; and Townsends Inc., \nof Millsboro, Del.",

The companies involved have\npleaded guilty to the government's charges, but they have refused\nto discuss details of the case beyond what the authorities\noriginally charged.\n\n\n   Now, virtually every big vitamin maker in the world is on the\nbrink of agreeing to pay an additional $1.1 billion to resolve a\nconsolidated class-action suit brought by purchasers of bulk\nvitamins _ the raw vitamin ingredients that go into everything from\ncereal and orange juice to vitamin pills and chicken feed. The suit\nalleges a wide variety of anti-competitive practices.\n\n\n   How could a conspiracy on this scale ever be born, much less\nsurvive a decade? How, in a global marketplace filled with\nsophisticated buyers and sellers, could a group of multinational\ncorporations, largely from Europe and Asia, avoid detection for so\nlong?\n\n\n   They did it, interviews with investigators and a review of court\ndocuments show, with a sly mixture of corporate panache and tight\ndiscipline _ nourished by a European tradition that encouraged such\nanti-competitive practices. The big vitamin makers aren't talking,\nexcept to say that they regret fixing prices and are working to\nkeep it from happening again.\n\n\n   ``We can't dispute the facts and we've decided it is of no value\nto unravel it. The situation is behind us,'' said Carolyn R. Glynn,\na spokeswoman at &UR;  &LR; Roche AG, which is based in Basel, Switzerland.\n``We've paid dearly for it.''\n\n\n   But even lacking chapter-and-verse corporate confessions, it is\nstill possible to piece together the outlines of this historic\nswindle.\n\n\n   It all began in 1989, when executives at Roche and BASF AG of\nGermany began holding secret talks about price-fixing, government\ninvestigators said. At the time, both companies faced pressure from\nrivals and from the prospect of falling prices.\n\n\n   Their solution was to agree, in secret, to carve up the vitamin\nmarket and to recruit other big vitamin makers to come in on the\narrangement, like Rhone-Poulenc of France and Takeda Chemical\nIndustries, Japan's largest pharmaceutical company. Because these\ncompanies have operations in the United States, this was a blatant\nviolation of the Sherman Antitrust Act.\n\n\n   ``These companies seemed to be indifferent to the possibility\nthat the antitrust laws would be enforced,'' said Robert Silver, a\nlawyer at Boies &AMP; Schiller, of Armonk, N.Y., who filed the first\nclass-action suit against the vitamin makers in 1998.\n\n\n   Roche was the ringleader. Its executives, federal investigators\nsay, organized the meetings, coordinated the price-fixing and\nordered documents destroyed. It wasn't just one Roche officer but a\nsuccession of high-level executives who carried out the details of\nthe plot.\n\n\n   The company had gone this route before. Roche's antitrust\nproblems date to the early 1970s, when it was fined by antitrust\nofficials in Europe for engaging in anticompetitive behavior in the\nsale of two tranquilizers, Librium and Valium.\n\n\n   Roche also faced litigation over the vitamin market in 1973\nafter Stanley Adams, a high-level executive in its vitam",

      "content": "EVIDENCE EMERGES ON INQUIRY INVOLVING ARCHER DANIELS \n\n\n\n   After more than three years of being shrouded in secrecy,\nevidence from the government's investigation of a huge price-fixing\nconspiracy involving Archer Daniels Midland Co. is emerging as the\nfirst criminal case stemming from the inquiry heads to trial.\n\n\n   The evidence, referenced in government records filed with the\nU.S. District Court in Chicago, portrayed the conspiracy between\nArcher Daniels and foreign competitors to fix prices of a feed\nadditive as a complex, often frustrating effort that involved\nseveral of the company's most senior officers.\n\n\n   During the efforts to hammer out a deal, according to the\ngovernment documents, competitors were invited to Decatur, Ill.,\nfor a lunch at Archer Daniels.\n\n\n   Senior officers then provided the competitors with a tour of its\nplant to impress upon them the company's ability to manufacture\nmass quantities of the additive lysine. That would decrease the\nworldwide price of lysine, cutting into all the companies' profits.\n\n\n   Jury selection began Thursday in the criminal case against three\nformer Archer Daniels executives _ Michael D. Andreas, who is now\non leave as the vice chairman of the company, Terrance S. Wilson,\nthe former head of its corn processing division, and Mark E.\nWhitacre, the former head of its bioproducts division. Opening\narguments are expected next week.\n\n\n   But records filed recently by the government lay out a blueprint\nof the prosecution's case, with a description of some evidence and\na detailed chronology of the events leading up to the federal raid\nof Archer Daniels in 1995.\n\n\n   Chief among the evidence described were recordings made by\nWhitacre, who worked for more than two years as a government\ninformant. Whitacre first alerted the government to the conspiracy\nin November 1992 and was offered immunity for his role as part of a\ncooperation pact. But prosecutors withdrew his immunity after\nlearning that Whitacre had illegally taken millions of dollars from\nArcher Daniels while working on the case.\n\n\n   In pretrial hearings, lawyers for Wilson and Andreas have made\nclear that they intend to attack the government's inquiry as shoddy\nand Whitacre as an out-of-control informant. They contended that\nWhitacre set up their clients, and that no price-fixing ever\nactually occurred. Lawyers for both men did not return calls\nThursday.\n\n\n   But the most compelling evidence described comes from the tapes.\nNumerous conversations, at times laced with obscenities, portrayed\nWilson as being intricately involved in the pricing scheme. At\ntimes, he was described as telling competitors that if they tried\nto compete on price, Archer Daniels would increase its production\nof lysine.\n\n\n   ``If we start losing business because of price,'' he was quoted\nas telling a competitor, ``then we will change our mind and do what\nwe have to do.''\n\n\n   Frequently, Andreas, the son of the company's chairman, Dwayne\nAndreas, was portrayed as an important strategist in the scheme.\nThe documents described repeated briefings of Andreas by Whitacre\non the progress of the scheme. During a briefing about one meeting\nwith competitors, Whitacre mentioned to Andreas that prices were\nrising slowly, to 85 cents a pound. ``Did you mention the idea that\nyou might take it up another nickel?'' Andreas asked.\n\n\n   At another meeting, Andreas was quoted as expressing frustration\nabout talks with competitors to control production levels. ``We got\nto start vocalizing our displeasure with volume,'' he was quoted as\nsaying, adding that Archer Daniels had to tell competitors that\nthey ``promised us we'd have our share if we backed off to the\nlevels we talked about.''\n\n\n   Other executives who have not been indicted in the case were\nalso portrayed as being aware of the scheme. For example, James\nRandall, the former president of Archer Daniels, was described as\nhaving attended the tour of the Archer Daniels plant with\ncompetitors, during which the benefits of price fixing were\ndiscussed by Wilson. That conversation was not recorded.\n\n\n   Jeff Col",

In places like Riyadh and Moscow and Oslo and Mexico\nCity and Vienna -- where OPEC and other oil producers meet to set\noil prices -- the very notion of U.S. antitrust principles must be\ngood for a horse laugh.\n\n\n   Of the major categories of behavior covered by the antitrust\nlaws, alleged misuse of a legally acquired monopoly (the issue in\nthe Microsoft case) is the murkiest area. Right and wrong are only\nsomewhat clearer when the issue is corporate mergers.\n\n\n   On the one hand, when competitors merge it reduces competition.\nOn the other hand, there may be genuine efficiencies from the\ncombination that will benefit consumers. The one clear form of\nmisbehavior is price-fixing.\n\n\n   When competitors get together to fix prices or limit supply, you\nget the stifled competition with no compensating efficiency. The\nSherman Antitrust Act forbids ``every contract, combination ... or\nconspiracy in restraint of trade among the several States or with\nforeign nations.'' Price-fixing is illegal ``per se,'' meaning\nthere's no need to prove harm or any other complication. Violators\ncan and do go to prison.\n\n\n   The Justice Department's big price-fixing case of the moment\ninvolves Sotheby's and Christie's, the two big art auction houses.\nThe case seems to rest mainly on a suspicious pattern of one\ncompany raising its commissions and the other following a few weeks\nlater. (It's not even clear what's so suspicious about this. Even\nin competitive markets, rivals end up charging the same price when\nthey sell the same products or services.) The investigation has\nbeen going on since 1997, and no charges have been brought, but the\nheads of both firms have been forced to resign. Thank you, Uncle\nSam, for your vigilance in protecting rich art collectors from\nexcessive fees.\n\n\n   Meanwhile, in Vienna, a price-fixing conspiracy of textbook\npurity, involving a commodity that affects everyone, went on\nunmolested. Strolling in and out of meetings, the conspirators\ntalked to reporters like coaches at halftime of a sports event. The\noil minister of the United Arab Emirates told The New York Times,\n``We have not discussed all the possibilities and all the\noptions.''\n\n\n   The Algerian oil minister says, ``I worry about a decline in\ndemand,'' but adds, ``If there is a consensus, we will support\nit.''\n\n\n   What went on in Vienna is flatly felonious behavior that is\nlifting billions of dollars from the pockets of American citizens.\nIt may be beyond the reach of conventional antitrust enforcement,\nbut it is not beyond all American discipline. If these oil\nministers were bank robbers (``No, we haven't yet decided whether\nto go for Chase Manhattan or Commerce Bank of Kansas City ...''),\nthe government would do more than send a Cabinet secretary like\nEnergy Secretary Bill Richardson to plead for moderation. (``Look,\nwhy not just take out a couple of suburban branches?'')\n\n\n   Under the law, it makes no difference if a price-fixing\nconspiracy attempts to raise prices or lower them and whether it\nsucceeds or fails. Raising prices too high can be self-defeating:\nYou get more per barrel, but you sell fewer barrels. If OPEC lowers\nprices, it does so in search of the ``sweet spot'' where long-term\nrevenue is maximized. There is no win-win here: The interests of\nthe price-fixers and the interests of consumers are directly\nopposite.\n\n\n   So, Republicans are right to criticize the Clinton\nadministration for being lackadaisical in its response to the\nlatest oil heist.

He denied that the two companies had cooperated in setting\nprices. Sean O'Donnell, a spokesman for Boeing in Seattle, declined\nto comment and referred inquiries to the commission. FTC officials\nwere unavailable for comment.\n\n\n   Karel van Miert, the European competition commissioner, said his\noffice had also sent ``a series of questions'' to the companies,\nBloomberg News reported. ``We have received substantial responses\nand are now evaluating them,'' van Miert said.\n\n\n   The FTC investigation, first reported Thursday by The Financial\nTimes of London, followed increases in list prices by both Airbus\nand Boeing. Boeing raised prices on its aircraft by 5 percent on\nJuly 21, its first increase in 23 years. Airbus made a 3 percent\nincrease in September.\n\n\n   ``There was no collusion whatsoever,'' said an Airbus spokesman\nin Toulouse, France, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n``That would be totally illegal.''\n\n\n   Last year, European antitrust regulators threatened to block the\n$14 billion merger of Boeing and the McDonnell Douglas Corp. The\nEuropean Commission let the deal go through after Boeing agreed to\nback away from exclusive supplier contracts it had signed with\nseveral U.S. airlines.\n\n\n   Both companies have been struggling for market share. Boeing,\nthe long-standing leader, has had about 60 percent and Airbus about\n30 percent.\n\n\n   Airbus recently obtained an order valued at $8.5 billion from\nBritish Airways PLC, which had been virtually an exclusive customer\nof Boeing, and a $3.5 billion commitment from a group of Latin\nAmerican airlines.\n\n\n   Industry officials have said that to obtain such orders, Airbus\nhad to reduce prices sharply, possibly to levels below its costs.\nThey said plane makers often made deals at discounted prices,\nexpecting to recover in lucrative follow-up deliveries of spare\nparts, services and additional orders for planes.\n\n\n   Boeing has been under pressure to raise prices after a $178\nmillion loss last year, its first in half a century. Ronald B.\nWoodward, president of the commercial aircraft division at Boeing,\nwas forced out and company officials suggested that their priority\nwould be profitability, even if they lost market share to Airbus.\n\n\n   The price of commercial jets has dropped 20 percent over the\nlast two years, squeezing the profit margins of plane makers.\nEarnings at Airbus fell 61 percent, to $147 million, last year.\n\n\n   Noel Forgeard, who took over as chief executive of Airbus on\nApril 1, is under pressure to improve profits as Airbus changes to\na unified corporation. It was created as a loose consortium of four\ncompanies _ Aerospatiale of France, Daimler of Germany, British\nAerospace and Construcciones Aeronauticas SA of Spain.\n\n\n   The revamped Airbus plans eventually to sell shares to\ninvestors.\n\n\n   Industry analysts found little merit in accusations of price\nfixing. ``On the contrary,'' said Daniel Solon, an analyst in\nLondon with Avmark International, a consulting firm. Price\nincreases would be ``a return to sanity by both companies,'' he\nsaid.\n\n\n   He said Forgeard's predecessor at Airbus, Jean Pierson, had cut\nprices in a drive for market share. Boeing tried to match the\nAirbus reductions. ``They are both right in getting less hysterical\nabout who has what relative share of the market,'' Solon said.\n\n\n   The European Commission can impose severe fines on companies\nthat it finds have been fixing prices.

In this\ncase, that formula did not work to the best interest of the\ninformant, Mark Whitacre.\n\n\n   But it also is partly the result of one finding by Judge Blanche\nManning during the sentencing hearing that has left legal experts\nperplexed. She determined that Whitacre was a manager of the\nconspiracy _ and thus liable to heavier penalties _ even though he\nwas outranked by at least one of his co-defendants, whom she found\nto have no managerial role.\n\n\n   ``I don't understand how it's possible,'' said John C. Coffee\nJr., a professor at Columbia University Law School. ``I'm just\ntrying to think of any shred of an explanation.''\n\n\n   Some legal experts said that the outcomes in the Archer Daniels\ncase underscored how the sentencing guidelines _ so often\ncriticized by judges as a straitjacket binding them to particular\noutcomes _ can, in certain cases, be about as restrictive as a\nsport coat.\n\n\n   In the case, the judge sentenced two executives, Michael Andreas\nand Terrance Wilson, to the same sentence: two years in prison and\na $350,000 fine. Andreas, the company's former vice chairman, and\nWilson, the former head of corn processing, were chief targets of\nthe criminal investigation almost from its opening days in 1992.\n\n\n   Whitacre was sentenced to two and a half years in prison even\nthough, just a few months after the price-fixing conspiracy began,\nhe brought the matter to the attention of the government. For years\nafterward, he worked as a government informant in the case,\nsecretly tape-recording his colleagues and competitors as they met\nto fix prices.\n\n\n   But Whitacre brought many of his troubles on himself. Soon after\nraids on Archer Daniels in 1995, Whitacre was discredited as a\nwitness and eventually lost his immunity from prosecution, when it\nwas disclosed that he had been illegally taking millions of dollars\nfrom the company, even while working as an informant.\n\n\n   That alone helped to account for some part of the odd outcome in\nthe price-fixing sentence. In 1997, Whitacre pleaded guilty to\nfraud charges and was already serving a nine-year sentence. As a\nresult, under the sentencing guideline calculations, Whitacre would\nbe treated as a repeat offender _ a designation that automatically\npumps up the possible sentences under the guidelines.\n\n\n   Then, by ruling that Whitacre was a manager in the conspiracy,\nwhile his co-defendants were not, the judge increased Whitacre's\n``offense level'' to the highest of any of the executives.\n\n\n   The ruling stumped legal experts. ``She's taking a very, very\nbizarre view of the word manager,'' said Gerald Lefcourt, a\nprominent defense lawyer in New York City. ``The vice chairman is\nat the higher level of the conspiracy. Not to give him a managerial\nrole and to give it to someone who carried out the price fixing is\npretty silly.''\n\n\n   Prosecutors in the case said that they could not explain the\nruling. But they pointed out that Whitacre's lawyer did not object\nto his designation as a manager, while lawyers for both Andreas and\nWilson did.\n\n\n   A clerk said that the judge would have no comment on her\nsentencing but would be issuing a written opinion on the case in\nthe next few days.\n\n\n   While that portion of the ruling struck legal experts as odd, in\nthe end it seemed to have made no difference to the actual time in\nprison Whitacre will serve. Only 20 months of Whitacre's new\nsentence will be on top of his current term, with the additional 10\nmonths served concurrently. In other words, the amount of",

      "content": "SUIT AGAINST NINE WEST ALLEGES FIXING PRICES OF SHOES\n\n\n\n   NEW YORK _ A lawsuit has been filed on behalf of millions of\nwomen who have purchased Nine West shoes at the nation's large\ndepartment stores, claiming that the giant footwear company\nconspired with the stores to illegally fix prices.\n\n\n   The lawsuit _ which seeks class-action status _ alleges that\nsince 1988, Nine West Group executives have met with managers from\nthe department stores to agree on the prices they would charge for\nthe company's 12 brands of shoes. Nine West and the stores have\nthen monitored each other, the lawsuit alleges, so that prices are\nnot lowered from those agreed upon.\n\n\n   The result, according to the suit filed Wednesday by the New\nYork law firm of Abbey, Gardy &AMP; Squitieri in U.S. District Court in\nWhite Plains, N.Y., is that women paid more for Nine West shoes\nthan they would have if the hundreds of department stores and Nine\nWest's own retail stores had competed on price.\n\n\n   Nine West, based in White Plains, said that it did not believe\nthe lawsuit would significantly affect the company or its financial\nresults based on its ``existing policies relating to resale pricing\nand the limited information available.''\n\n\n   The company also said that at least two state attorneys general\nwere investigating its pricing policies. It did not disclose the\nstates. The company had earlier acknowledged that the Federal Trade\nCommission was investigating its pricing practices.\n\n\n   Joel Bedol, Nine West's general counsel, said Monday that the\ncompany had no further comment.\n\n\n   The department stores named in the lawsuit include Federated\nDepartment Stores Inc., which owns Macy's, Bloomingdale's, and Bon\nMarche; May Department Stores Co., which owns Lord &AMP; Taylor; Dayton\nHudson Corp., which owns Marshall Fields; Dillard's Inc.; and\nNordstrom Inc.\n\n\n   Brooke White, a spokeswoman for Nordstrom, said that the company\nwould contest the suit. ``It is our policy to not have any\nconversation about price or sale-date setting or other competitive\nmatters with any other retailers,'' Ms. White said. ``We play no\npart in determining what vendor-suggested retail prices are.''\n\n\n   Carol Sanger, a spokeswoman for Federated, said that the company\ndid not comment on pending litigation. ``We clearly, most\ncertainly, do not engage in price-fixing,'' she said.\n\n\n   Spokesmen at both Dayton Hudson and May Department Stores said\nthe companies did not wish to comment on the lawsuit. Officials at\nDillard's could not be reached.\n\n\n   Under federal antitrust laws, it is illegal for two or more\ncompanies to agree on the minimum retail prices they will charge.\nBut several recent court decisions have weakened the law's\nprotections for consumers. For example, the courts have ruled that\nit is not illegal for a distributor to demand that stores follow\nits price list and then to cut off shipments to those stores that\ndo not comply.\n\n\n   Nine West sells hundreds of millions of dollars of shoes to the\ndepartment stores each year. While it does not disclose sales to\neach store, its 1997 annual report said Federated was its largest\nwholesale customer, making up 12 percent of its net revenue, or\nabout $224 million.\n\n\n   The company also sells shoes at its own retail stores and to\nother independent shoe stores. In shopping malls around the\ncountry, the small shoe stores are often located near the\ndepartment stores.\n\n\n   The company, which says it sells one of every 5 pairs of shoes\nthat American women buy, offers 12 brands, including Easy Spirit,\nEnzo Angiolini and Bandolino.\n\n\n   According to the lawsuit, at least four times a year,\nhigh-ranking representatives from the department stores meet with\nNine West's management in New York and agree on the minimum prices\nthey will charge. By the end of those meetings, the lawsuit claims,\nNine West and the department stores have agreed to a list of\nminimum prices.",

Cox, told federal\nofficials that in the early 1990s he had spoken more than a dozen\ntimes with the Cargill executive, William M. Gruber, ``about what\neach would be bidding on specific accounts'' in the sale of citric\nacid to giant food and consumer product companies. Citric acid is\nan additive used in everything from soft drinks to detergents.\n\n\n   According to records of two interviews in 1996 and 1997, which\nwere recently made public as part of a related criminal case, Cox\ntold investigators that he believed Gruber, formerly the head of\nnational sales of citric acid at Cargill, might have been acting\nwithout the knowledge of other Cargill officials.\n\n\n   Government prosecutors have said that Cargill did not take part\nwith Archer Daniels and three other companies _ the Haarmann &AMP;\nReimer Corp. of Springfield, N.J., Hoffman-LaRoche Inc., a division\nof Roche Holdings in Switzerland and Jungbunzlauer Inc. of Austria\n_ in a much broader international conspiracy. That scheme involved\nregular meetings in the early 1990s to illegally fix prices in the\ncitric acid market. The four companies eventually paid more than\n$100 million to settle government charges of illegal price-fixing.\n\n\n   The Justice Department said last week that it was not\ninvestigating Cargill or Gruber at this time.\n\n\n   The Cox statements could play a significant role in an appeal of\na class-action suit against Cargill, filed by purchasers of citric\nacid who claim they were cheated by the company. Earlier this week,\nlawyers for the purchasers filed a motion citing the Cox statements\nas grounds for overturning a dismissal of the case for lack of\nevidence.\n\n\n   Cox said in interviews with federal prosecutors that between\n1992 and 1995 he and Gruber worked together to rig bids on the sale\nof citric acid to giant U.S. companies. The interviews were\nconducted under a federal order that granted Cox immunity but did\nnot shield him from criminal prosecution for making false or\nmisleading statements.\n\n\n   Cargill officials vehemently denied any suggestion that the\ncompany or Gruber took part in bid rigging or price-fixing. Richard\nJ. Favretto, an attorney for Cargill, called Cox's statements\n``wholly unsubstantiated'' and said that after a thorough,\nfour-year investigation of the citric acid market, the Justice\nDepartment had taken no action against Cargill or any of its\nemployees. Cargill officials said Gruber declined to comment.\n\n\n   Cargill also released a letter it secured upon request last week\nfrom Phillip H. Warren, assistant chief of the Justice Department's\nantitrust division, which said that ``Cargill Inc. and William M.\nGruber are neither targets of, nor currently under investigation\nin, the antitrust division's investigation of possible criminal\nantitrust violations in the citric acid industry.''\n\n\n   Justice Department officials confirmed that they had sent the\nletter but declined to elaborate.\n\n\n   Archer Daniels, Cargill and the three other makers of citric\nacid were also accused in the class-action suit of conspiring to\nfix the price of citric acid. Cox told investigators that he and\nGruber discussed the bids for Coca-Cola, Mars, Procter &AMP; Gamble and\nPhillip Morris' Kraft Foods division. Coca-Cola and Mars are part\nof the class-action suit. Procter &AMP; Gamble and Kraft are not.\n\n\n   Archer Daniels and the three other companies agreed to pay $94\nmillion to settle the class-action suit in 1996. But Cargill\nrefused to join the settlement, saying it was not part of the\nconspiracy.\n\n\n   The class-action suit proceeded against Cargill.

Andreas, son of longtime ADM chief Dwayne \nAndreas, and Wilson were convicted last September. \n\n\n\tIn seeking the $25 million fines, as well as prison time for  \nAndreas, prosecutors said such punishment would reflect the amount \nof money ADM allegedly reaped in the scheme. \n\n\n\tBut U.S. District Judge Blanche Manning berated the Justice  \nDepartment in a ruling Wednesday, saying it failed to prove how \nmuch lysine sales were affected by the scheme. \n\n\n\tThe defendants had said a $25 million fine was too high, given  \nthe amount of lysine produced in the world during the price-fixing \nscheme. They sought proof for their argument from overseas lysine \nproducers who allegedly participated in the price-fixing \nconspiracy. \n\n\n\tManning said the government wrote letters to the overseas  \nproducers ``informing them that they were not obliged to produce \ndocuments'' for Andreas and Wilson. She called the government's \naction ``so incredible that it bordered on being ludicrous.'' \n\n\n\tShe also called the government's defense of the action ``wholly  \ndeceptive.'' Prosecutors had claimed that it was unclear whether \nforeign businesses could be required to cooperate with the U.S. \njustice system. \n\n\n\tIn addition to the fine, federal prosecutors had sought three  \nyears in prison, the maximum allowable, against Andreas. Manning \ndid not address prison time in her ruling. \n\n\n\tA Justice Department spokeswoman would not comment on strategy  \nfollowing Manning's order. \n\n\n\t``We are disappointed with the judge's decision and we are  \nprepared for the sentencing on July 9,'' spokeswoman Jennifer Rose \nsaid. \n\n\n\tMark Whitacre, the mole who tape-recorded meetings where the  \nprice-fixing scheme was discussed, will also be sentenced July 9. \nHis attorney is seeking a sentence concurrent with the nine-year \nterm Whitacre is already serving for bilking ADM of $9 million \nwhile working as chief of the bioproducts division. Manning said he \nalso faces a maximum $350,000 fine.",

(AP) -- A federal class-action lawsuit has  \nbeen filed against Nine West Group and several large department \nstore chains, claiming they kept prices artificially high for years \non 12 brands of women's shoes. \n\n\n\tThe suit claims that Nine West enforced the price list by  \nthreatening to cut off supplies to any retailer who didn't toe the \nline. Violations were reported to the company by ``agents'' from \nthe stores, who spied on each other. \n\n\n\t``The defendants sold millions of pairs of Nine West footwear,  \nat prices inflated by the illegal price-fixing conspiracy,'' \naccording to the lawsuit, filed last week in White Plains, where \nNine West is headquartered. \n\n\n\tJoshua Rubin, lawyer for the plaintiffs, is asking federal Judge  \nBarrington Parker to certify the lawsuit as a class action on \nbehalf of anyone who bought, or considered buying, Nine West models \nthat were on the alleged price-fixing lists between 1988 and the \npresent. \n\n\n\tIt seeks unspecified damages, plus an injunction against  \nprice-fixing agreements. \n\n\n\tNine West is also under investigation by the Federal Trade  \nCommission for price-fixing allegations. \n\n\n\t``The law prohibits you from telling a retailer how to market  \nhis goods. You can't tell a retailer not to lower his price,'' said \nLarry Schulsinger, a partner at the retail consulting firm \nManagement Ventures Inc. \n\n\n\t``But manufacturers know that price-cutting hurts the value of  \nbrand, and they have reasons to want their brand to continue to \ncommand strong prices.'' \n\n\n\tCalls to Nine West were referred to Chief Financial Officer Bob  \nGalvin, who did not return them. \n\n\n\tNine West, which makes such popular brands as Enzo Angiolini,  \nBandolino, Easy Spirit, Calvin Klein, Westies and Pappagallo, fits \ninto a niche between designer shoes and discount shoes with prices \ngenerally between $50 and $90. \n\n\n\tIt claims one-fifth of all the shoes sold to women in America.  \nIts shoes are sold primarily in department stores, company-owned \nretail outlets and independent shoe stores. \n\n\n\tAccording to the suit, Nine West's top management meets at least  \nfour times a year with high-ranking representatives of the \nretailers that buy their shoes. Minimum prices -- and time periods \nduring which the prices will be enforced -- are agreed upon for the \nvarious brands and models, the suit says. \n\n\n\tAfterward, it says, ``The department stores and Nine West each  \nmonitor the retail prices charged ... by sending agents into other \nretailers' stores.'' \n\n\n\t``Each department store reports to Nine West whenever it learns  \nof any violation,'' the suit says, and then the company enforces \nthe restrictions ``by refusing to sell them its footwear products, \nby interfering with their advertising programs and by other \ncoercive retaliatory measures.'' \n\n\n\tStores named in the suit include Federated Department Stores  \nInc., which owns Macy's and Bloomingdale's, and May Department \nStores Co., which owns Lord &AMP; Taylor, Dillard's Inc., Dayton Hudson \nCorp. and Nordstrom Inc. \n\n\n\tFederated has denied involvement in price-fixing. May declined  \ncomment. Dayton Hudson did not return calls for comment. Officials \nat Dillard's could not be reached. \n\n\n\tNordstrom spokeswoman Brooke White said that the department  \nstore will contest the suit and plays ``no part in determining what \nvendors' suggested retail prices are.''",

It seeks unspecified damages and to have the joint \nventures dissolved. \n\n\n\t``It's a straight, old-fashioned price-fixing agreement,'' said  \nJoseph Alioto, the attorney for 39 dealers named as plaintiffs in \nthe suit. \n\n\n\tDuring the past 18 months, the prices dealers have paid for gas  \nhave risen between 25 cents and 55 cents per gallon, said Tom \nBleau, co-counsel for the 39 dealers named as plaintiffs in the \nsuit. Over the same period, the price in the gasoline futures \nmarket has declined by more than 4 cents a gallon. \n\n\n\tRent increases have ranged from 30 percent to 100 percent, Bleau  \nsaid. An independent dealer rents a gas station location from an \noil company, but owns the business itself. \n\n\n\tThe three companies refine and market gasoline in the eastern  \nUnited States through Houston-based Motiva Enterprises LLC. \n\n\n\tTexaco and Shell refine and market in the West and Midwest  \nthrough a separate firm, Equilon Enterprises LLC, also based in \nHouston. Saudi Refining is not part of Equilon. \n\n\n\tA third company, Equiva Services, provides various services to  \nMotiva and Equilon. The three ventures also were named in the \nlawsuit. \n\n\n\t``The formation of Equilon, Motiva and Equiva was done for  \nlegitimate business reasons,'' said Andy Norman, a spokesman for \nTexaco. ``It was totally proper and the formation of those \ncompanies has led to a number of efficiencies in our ... \noperations.'' \n\n\n\tCreation of the ventures was the subject of an investigation by  \nthe Federal Trade Commission and attorney generals in several \nstates where the companies operate. No wrongdoing was found, Norman \nsaid. \n\n\n\tEquilon issued a statement calling the allegations preposterous.  \nCalls to the other defendants were not immediately returned. \n\n\n\tIn the suit, dealers contend their rents and prices were raised  \nsoon after the joint ventures began. As a result, they have had to \nsell gasoline at uncompetitive prices, they said. \n\n\n\tSmall stations, whether independent or company owned, have  \nstruggled to sell enough gasoline to stay open, but ``these are \nmarket forces. They're not collusion,'' said Bill Berman, publisher \nof The Pump Price Report, a weekly survey of gasoline prices and \nsupply. \n\n\n\t``They're not intentional efforts by the refiners or  \nwholesalers,'' he said. \n\n\n\tThe gas station business has grown increasingly difficult in  \nrecent years. The number of service stations in the United States \nhas dropped sharply during the past five years, from 202,800 to \n177,800, according to a survey by National Petroleum News, a trade \nmagazine. The survey did not include separate numbers for \nindependent dealers.",

And\nsome of the prices may be ordered reduced by ISO New England, the\nHolyoke nonprofit company that runs the power auction for the\nsix-state region and can act to prevent gouging.\n\n\n   ``Mrs. Murphy at 222 Elm Street or even a large industrial\ncustomer isn't affected by this at all,'' said Neal B. Costello,\ngeneral counsel to the Competitive Power Coalition, a Boston group\nthat represents plant owners selling to the grid.\n\n\n   ``The emphatic answer to the question is: The retail customer\ndoes not pay,'' Costello said. ``It's the wholesale middlemen who\nare at risk. They fully know what the risks are, and it really is\ncapitalism at its best.''\n\n\n   Boston Edison, for example, buys all power for its 550,000\ncustomers under a long-term, fixed-price contract with Select\nEnergy, a subisidary of Northeast Utilities, said Edison spokesman\nMichael Monahan.\n\n\n   Likewise, ComEnergy, serving 360,000 homes and businesses in a\nregion that includes Cambridge, New Bedford, and Cape Cod, gets\n``100 percent under contracts. We don't buy power on the spot\nmarket,'' said spokesman Peter A. Dimond.\n\n\n   Overall, on a typical day, about 88 percent of power moving\nthrough the New England grid has been paid for on a fixed-price\ncontract, and 12 percent is being purchased on the spot market,\nsaid Jim Sinclair, a spokesman for the ISO group.\n\n\n   Under the new wholesale auction market that began May 1 in New\nEngland, who is buying and selling power at what price is now a\nclosely guarded trade secret, and efforts to learn who was paying\nand getting the huge prices were unsuccessful.\n\n\n   Some of the big players in the trading market are known to\ninclude Enron, Select Energy, and Southern Energy, as well as a\nhost of energy brokerages. They guarantee to provide certain levels\nof power to utilities or big producers and then play the market to\nget the best price, bearing risk when the supply-demand curve\ndrives prices through the roof.\n\n\n   Over the last two days, an unexpected heat wave combined with\nreduced generating capacity pushed demand for electricity almost\npast what the New England grid can supply. A half-dozen of the\nlargest of the region's 330 plants are off line for scheduled\nservice, but additional power is also available from connections to\nthe New York and Canadian grids.\n\n\n   ISO New England officials threatened to impose two-hour rolling\nblackouts Tuesday morning, but backed off after voluntary\nconservation efforts _ including a state government shutdown in\nMassachusetts _ eased demand to safe levels.\n\n\n   Under the new system, ISO New England each day takes\nhour-by-hour bids to supply the next day's spot-market power needs\nand takes bidders from cheapest to most expensive, paying all spot\nbidders the highest bid price each hour. Fixed-contract prices,\nhowever, do not fluctuate with the market.\n\n\n   As demand rises to levels nearly exceeding supply, the ISO has\nto start accepting bids from, for example, plant owners who have\noffered to turn on an ancient generator only for a huge price or\nfrom speculators who offer to sell their last few megawatts at a\ngigantic premium.\n\n\n   Costello said that despite what may look like ``profiteering''\nby companies taking advantage of a regional energy crisis, ``from a\nconsumer standpoint, it's more important to ask what is an average\nyearly price'' for electricity.",

The key\ncomponent allows contractors to competitively bid on fixed-price\ncontracts. The contractor designs, finances and builds the\nfacilities needed to do the cleanup work and typically receives\nminimum guidance from DOE. The department only pays for products or\nservices delivered.\n\n\n   That is different from past practices, in which DOE signed\ncost-reimbursement contracts. Under those, DOE would finance the\noperations, tell contractors how to perform cleanup activities and\npay them for their efforts regardless of what was accomplished.\n\n\n   GAO analyzed three fixed-price contracts. But DOE Senior Adviser\nfor Environmental Affairs Ellen Livingston said the agency\ncurrently has 37 fixed-price contracts spread out among 44 cleanup\nsites. While Livingston did not dispute GAO's findings, she said\nsome of its contracts were yielding positive results.\n\n\n   Livingston said GAO and Congress previously urged DOE to move\ntoward privatization. ''Nobody was happy with the old cost-plus\napproach,'' she said.\n\n\n   Rep. Thomas Bliley Jr., R-Va., who chairs the Commerce\nCommittee, said the agency needs to do a better job managing\ncontracts, whether they are fixed-price or not.\n\n\n   He said previous GAO studies showed, under the old system, the\nagency's cleanup projects were experiencing cost overruns averaging\n60 percent above contract price. But Bliley said things appear to\nbe worse now.\n\n\n   He noted that the cost of a cleanup project at the Hanford\nnuclear reservation in Richland, Wash., had increased 120 percent\nabove the contract price from $6.9 billion to $15.2 billion.\n\n\n   ''DOE's fixed-price contract reform efforts have made a\ndeplorable situation much worse,'' Bliley said.\n\n\n   Last month, DOE said it planned to terminate the Hanford\ncontract with BNFL Inc., a subsidiary of British Nuclear Fuels. It\ncited the escalating costs and concerns about BNFL's performance.\nLivingston said the department would probably seek a new contract\nusing the cost-reimbursable approach.\n\n\n   David Campbell, BNFL manager of external corporate affairs,\nblamed the overruns on the project's expansion and said it would\nhave gone up in price no matter what kind of contract was in place.\n\n\n   BNFL also is working under a $238 million, fixed-price contract\nin Oak Ridge, Tenn., and the company recently said it would need at\nleast $100 million more to complete that job.\n\n\n AP-NY-06-21-00 1841",

Details of the agreement were not fully disclosed.\n\n\n   The pharmacies had contended in a number of lawsuits that were\nfiled in 1993, and eventually consolidated into one class-action\ncase, that large drug makers had conspired to develop a two-tier\npricing system during the early 1990s. The drug makers gave\ndiscounts to managed-care companies and health-maintenance\norganizations, the pharmacy owners said, while charging them higher\nprices.\n\n\n   Under the deal presented Tuesday, the drug makers agreed to\nrefrain from a two-tier pricing system, without admitting any\nliability, said lawyers involved in the agreement.\n\n\n   While Tuesday's proposed settlement moved the case one step\ncloser to completion, it remains far from over.\n\n\n   Two years ago, 11 pharmaceutical makers agreed to pay $351\nmillion to settle the price-fixing contentions, leaving eight\ndefendants in the case. After four more agreed to the proposed\nsettlement Tuesday, that left four big pharmaceutical companies _\nNovartis, Johnson &AMP; Johnson, the G.D. Searle unit of Monsanto and\nForest Laboratories _ to refute the pharmacies' contentions in a\ntrial before Kocoras, which is set to begin Sept. 14.\n\n\n   ``We are encouraged four drug manufacturers are joining others\nwho have previously agreed to settle a class-action lawsuit by\nretail community pharmacies over allegations of manufacturer\nprice-fixing,'' said Ronald L. Ziegler, the chief executive of the\nNational Association of Chain Drug Stores, an industry group in\nAlexandria, Va. ``Hopefully, all manufacturers will practice the\nterms of the settlement.''\n\n\n   Abbott Laboratories and Hoechst Marion Roussel declined to\ncomment Tuesday. Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn said in a statement that it had\nagreed to pay $102.5 million, a bit less than one-third of the\ntotal tentative settlement. As a result, the company said, it must\nincrease reserves by $61 million and take a $41 million after-tax\ncharge against earnings in the second quarter, which ended June 30.\n\n\n   John Abrams, a spokesman for Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, said Tuesday\nthat the amount the company had agreed to pay was ``substantially\nless'' than Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn's share. Rhone-Poulenc agreed to\nsettle, he said, to avoid the risks and uncertainty of litigation.\n\n\n   Tuesday's proposed settlement would bring the total settlement\namount to about $700 million, which will be held in escrow until\nthe case is completed. The pharmacy owners must determine how the\nmoney will be divided. Initially, the small pharmacy owners had\nwanted an equal split regardless of size, while proprietors of the\nlarger stores wanted a formula based on per-store drug sales\nvolume.\n\n\n   According to a lawyer involved in the negotiations, the two\ngroups are considering a plan that provides for a minimum payout\nwith additional money allotments based on drug sales.\n\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n\n   With Tuesday's tentative settlement, the drugstore owners\nappeared optimistic that they would win the antitrust trial,\nsinking their last four opponents. They may have reason to feel\nconfident, according to one lawyer involved in the agreement.\nDuring the pretrial phase of the case the pharmacies have uncovered\ndocuments that not only appear to confirm their accusations, but\nhave been aired publicly in court.\n\n\n   In April 1996, Kocoras quoted from documents that had been\npresented in the case and said it was ``unquestionable'' that the\ndrug companies ``had the opportunity to conspire.''

Their firms\nmay also be subject to SEC sanctions. The amount of the proposed\nfines relates to the amount of evidence found on recorded tapes\nthat the SEC subpoenaed as part of its investigation, the\nexecutives said. Brokerage firms routinely tape the conversations\nof their traders to prevent disputes about transactions.\n\n\n   ``They seem to have gone through the tapes and have an arbitrary\nnumber of people acting,'' said a senior official at one firm\nWednesday. ``They have some formula of amount per offense.'' The\nSEC, this executive said, has listened to tapes and found a\nspecific number of instances in which, in effect, collusion on\nprices took place.\n\n\n   Spokesmen for the SEC and for several major brokerage firms,\nincluding Goldman, Sachs, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Paine Webber,\nSalomon Smith Barney, Warburg Dillon Read LLC, all declined to\ncomment on the issue Wednesday.\n\n\n   The government has been investigating price-fixing on the Nasdaq\nstock market since the summer of 1994, when a study by two\nprofessors _ William Christie of Vanderbilt University and Paul\nSchulz of Ohio State University _ argued that brokerage firms had\ncolluded to raise their profit margins from their trading on the\nNasdaq stock market.\n\n\n   The SEC subsequently investigated the National Association of\nSecurities Dealers, which operates the Nasdaq market. In August\n1996, the SEC censured the NASD for its failure to regulate the\nmarket adequately, prompting the NASD to overhaul the way it\nregulates the Nasdaq market, and spend tens of millions of dollars\nto reorganize its regulation of the Nasdaq market.\n\n\n   A class-action lawsuit brought against more than 30 brokerage\nfirms on behalf of investors who traded shares on the Nasdaq market\nhas also resulted in a number of settlements with individual\nbrokerage firms.\n\n\n   The suit charged collusion and price-fixing. Herzog, Heine &AMP;\nGeduld Inc., for example, in June 1997 agreed to pay investors\n$30.6 million to its part of that case. The suit contended that the\nfirms colluded in trading spreads artificially wide in securities\ntrading on the Nasdaq market in the years between May 1989 and May\n1994.",

And the\ngrain exceeding the fixed quotas will be purchased at protective\nprices, which refers to the standard prices set by the State\nCouncil.\n\n\nChina has witnessed good harvests for several years running,\nand the grain reserve is at an all-time record high. This is an\nimportant guarantee for the sustained, rapid and healthy\ndevelopment of the national economy, Zhu pointed out.\n\n\nHe asked the state-run grain systems to purchase grain at\nprotective prices and never reject, stop or restrict grain\npurchase or give farmers IOUs.\n\n\nTalking about how to increase the farmers' incomes and protect\ntheir interests, Zhu said that the grain growing structure should\nbe rationally adjusted according to the market demand.",

      "content": "EDITORIAL: OIL PRICE MYSTERIES  \n\n\n\n\n   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, June 17:\n\n\n   Gasoline prices have risen above $2 a gallon in Chicago and\nMilwaukee, about 25 percent higher than two months ago, angering\ndrivers and sending political shock waves through Washington.\nDrivers blame retailers. Refiners blame federal regulations, the\ncourts and OPEC. Federal regulators suspect price fixing. Some of\nthese charges are just plain wrong. Others have more merit but do\nnot account for the whole problem.\n\n\n   The fact that gasoline prices across the country are about 25\npercent higher than they were a year ago is unsurprising. OPEC\nrefuses to keep crude oil prices under $28 a barrel as it promised\nin the spring. As of June 1, refineries have been required to sell\ncleaner-burning gasoline _ which refiners say creates production\nproblems. A federal court recently ruled that the Unocal Corp.\ncould charge refiners royalties for a specific technique for\nproducing cleaner-burning gasoline _ forcing refiners to turn to\nmore expensive methods.\n\n\n   As for the particularly high prices in Chicago, the industry\npoints to problems specific to the Midwest. A broken pipeline has\nreduced gasoline flow by 20 percent. The Midwest relies on ethanol\nto satisfy a federal requirement to cut down on carbon onoxide\nemissions. But the use of ethanol makes it hard to also satisfy the\nJune 1 requirements, leading to supply disruptions in the Midwest.\nFor gasoline, it takes only a small reduction in supply to trigger\nlarge price hikes.\n\n\n   Federal authorities are unconvinced by the industry's laying\nblame elsewhere. They say the companies have known about the June 1\nrequirements for five years. And they challenge industry estimates\nshowing that gasoline supplies are low in the Midwest. The Federal\nTrade Commission will investigate price fixing. But previous\ninvestigations of the oil industry have proved fruitless.\n\n\n   No clear explanation for $2-a-gallon gasoline may emerge. The\nprice surge could well turn out to be the product of a combination\nof factors that will dissipate as quickly as they emerged.",

      "content": "NEWS STORY \n 2000-01-29 01:33 \n $3.1B in Farm Subsidies Proposed  \n   By PHILIP BRASHER AP Farm Writer\n\n\n\t   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is proposing new farm\nsubsidies that would take effect when commodity prices are low.\n\n\n\t   The ``supplemental income'' payments, estimated to cost taxpayers $3.1\nbillion this year, would vary in size according to fluctuations in crop revenue.\nThey are meant to substitute for emergency subsidies that Congress has made the\npast two years to compensate growers for a collapse in exports and commodity\nprices.\n\n\n\t   Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said the program would ``strengthen the\nfarm safety net'' until Congress rewrites existing farm policy in 2002.\n\n\n\t   ``Payments will increase when times are the toughest and will taper off when\nprices rebound,'' Glickman said in a conference call Friday with farm\nbroadcasters.\n\n\n\t   The administration's proposal, which is similar to an idea offered last year\nby Rep. Charles Stenholm, D-Texas, is certain to run into opposition from many\nproducers and lawmakers because of the limits on the payments.\n\n\n\t   The payments would be pegged to the average gross income nationally over the\npast five years for eight major crops -- corn, wheat, cotton, rice, soybeans,\nsorghum, oats and barley -- and would be capped at $30,000 per operation. Most\nfarmers would get far less than that because their annual ``market-transition''\npayments, the fixed subsidies they receive under the 1996 law, would count\ntoward the $30,000 limit.\n\n\n\t   Some 1.3 million farmers currently receive market transition payments, and\n200,000 get at least $10,000 a year. Of those, 30,000 receive more than $30,000.\n\n\n\t   ``The size of an operation doesn't necessarily limit the difficulty that\nanybody has financially,'' said Dick Newpher, chief lobbyist for the American\nFarm Bureau Federation, the nation's largest farm group. ``We would like to help\nall of agriculture.''\n\n\n\t   But John Schnittker Sr., a private consultant and former Agriculture\nDepartment economist, said that capping the payments ``is the right thing to do,\nboth from the fiscal standpoint, to avoid runaway costs, and from the standpoint\nof getting most of the money to relatively modest-size farmers.''\n\n\n\t   The program would fix what the Clinton administration and some producer\ngroups see as a major flaw in the 1996 farm law, which scaled back income-based\nfarm subsidies, ended controls on planting and gave farmers a series of fixed\nannual payments. Critics say the fixed payments were insufficient when commodity\nprices fell sharply in 1998.\n\n\n\t   The new subsidy program will be included in President Clinton's 2001 budget\nalong with $1.3 billion in farm conservation spending that Vice President Al\nGore announced earlier this month and an additional $640 million earmarked for\ncutting premiums on federally subsidized crop insurance. The government has\noffered similar insurance discounts in 1999 and again this year in order to\nencourage more farmers to buy the coverage to protect against weather-related\nlosses.\n\n\n\t   Because commodity prices are only expected to rise slowly during the next\nseveral years, support has been building in Congress and among farm\norganizations to come up with a new way to subsidize growers when prices are\nlow.\n\n\n\t   The administration's new program was originally proposed by economists at\nthe Agriculture Department and Ohio State University in the early 1990s. Critics\nhave said the payments could worsen the worldwide grain glut by encouraging\nfarmers to plant crops in areas where they do not do well, something the 1996\nfarm law was intended to discourage.\n\n\n\t   Newpher, the Farm Bureau lobbyist, praised the administration for proposing\nthe program. Clinton had proposed improving the farm ``safety net'' in his State\nof the Union message a year ago and again Thursday night, but the administration\nnever spelled out a proposal of its own until Friday.\n\n\n\t   ``We need to get started on this discussion right away,'' Newpher said.\n\n\n AP-NY-01-29-00 0133",

      "content": "PRICE-FIXING TRIAL OPENS FOR 3 EX-ARCHER OFFICIALS \n\n\n\n   CHICAGO _ In opening arguments in one of the largest\nprice-fixing trials ever, a federal prosecutor said Wednesday that\nformer senior executives with Archer Daniels Midland Co. ``were\ncaught red-handed'' on secret recordings conspiring with\ncompetitors to set the market prices for a popular feed additive.\n\n\n   But a defense lawyer for one of the executives challenged that\nclaim, saying that the recordings of his client had captured very\nlittle, and that meetings the government portrayed as incriminating\ninvolved little more than discussions about the functioning of the\nmarket for the additive, lysine.\n\n\n   In the opening statements, the two sides disclosed for the first\ntime that price fixing in the lysine market predated the entry of\nArcher Daniels in the business, involving a small cartel of\nJapanese and other Asian companies. And a defense lawyer also said\nthat, during investigation the government's chief informant on at\nleast one occasion secretly taped an FBI agent involved in the\ncase.\n\n\n   Three former executives from Archer Daniels _ Michael D.\nAndreas, the former vice chairman who is on leave from the company;\nTerrance Wilson, the former head of the company's corn processing\ndivision, and Mark E. Whitacre, the former head of its bioproducts\ndivision _ were charged by the government as participating in the\nconspiracy.\n\n\n   But it is Whitacre who will clearly be at center stage\nthroughout most of the trial. It was Whitacre who first disclosed\nthe price fixing between the competitors and who secretly recorded\nconversations over two and a half years. But he became a defendant\nin the case after the government learned he had violated his\ncooperation agreement by taking millions of dollars from Archer\nDaniels, even as he was working with law enforcement officials.\n\n\n   Over more than an hour, the prosecutor, James M. Griffin,\nmethodically described the government's evidence, as he led the\njury through a narrative of the major meetings during which the\nlysine competitors agreed to fix prices and allocate production\nvolumes among themselves.\n\n\n   Griffin said that to prove the crime the government had only to\nprovide evidence that an agreement to fix prices had been reached.\n\n\n   ``The agreement is the crime,'' he said. ``It does not matter if\nthe conspirators kept the agreement.''\n\n\n   Griffin said that the government would prove that price fixing\nwas nothing new at Archer Daniels. For example, he said that one\nwitness would testify that Wilson had been fixing prices on citric\nacid, a food additive, since 1991, before the lysine scheme began.\n\n\n   Griffin added that the taped evidence alone proved the roles of\nAndreas and Wilson. ``Michael Andreas and Terry Wilson were caught\nred-handed on audio and videotape committing the crime they are\ncharged with,'' he said.\n\n\n   But John Bray, a lawyer for Andreas, said that there was no\ncompelling recordings clearly proving that his client had engaged\nin wrongdoing, and that he was innocent. ``If ever there was a\ncase, ever, where there are two sides to the story, then this is\nit,'' Bray said.\n\n\n   Rather than encouraging lawbreaking, Andreas was trying to take\non the illegal Asian cartel, Bray said. At times, he said, his\nclient can be heard on tape saying that Archer Daniels ``does not\nmake deals'' with competitors relating to price and volume.\nMoreover, Bray said, the tapes that do exist are ambiguous as to\ntheir meaning.\n\n\n   The reason the case emerged, Bray said, was that in 1992\nWhitacre had falsely told Archer Daniels that a competitor was\nattempting to extort millions of dollars from the company. Archer\nDaniels called in the government, and the FBI went to discuss the\nallegations with Whitacre. During that visit, Whitacre told the\nagent about a price-fixing conspiracy. Bray contended that the\nrevelation was designed to take attention away from the bogus\nextortion story, which he said Whitacre had concocted for his own\nenrichment.\n\n\n   In his opening, Bill T. Walker, a lawyer for Whitacre, said that\nthe opening",

      "content": "RECORDINGS PLAYED IN TRIAL OF 3 EX-ARCHER OFFICIALS\n\n\n\n   CHICAGO _ A Japanese agricultural executive identified two\nformer senior officers of Archer Daniels Midland Co. as having met\nwith him in a price-fixing conspiracy, on a day when secret\ngovernment recordings of pricing discussions were played in public\nfor the first time.\n\n\n   The information emerged in the first day of evidence in the\ntrial of three executives who worked for ADM. The testimony and\nrecordings underscored the deep sense of distrust and dislike among\nthe companies that have already pleaded guilty to conspiring to fix\nthe price of lysine, a feed additive.\n\n\n   In one document, an Asian lysine producer raised the possibility\nof bombing Archer Daniel's lysine plant, to slow the company's\nentry into the business. And, on tape recordings, a Japanese\nexecutive discussed how a Korean company that had agreed to fix\nprices ``by nature will tell a lie.''\n\n\n   The government has charged the three former executives _ Michael\nAndreas, the vice chairman who is on leave from the company;\nTerrance Wilson, head of the company's corn processing division,\nand Mark Whitacre, the head of its bioproducts division _ with\nparticipating in the conspiracy from 1991 to 1995.\n\n\n   The tape recordings were obtained from Whitacre, who became a\ngovernment informant less than a year after prosecutors say the\nscheme involving Archer Daniels began. But he became a defendant in\nthe case after the government learned he had violated his\ncooperation agreement by taking millions of dollars from Archer\nDaniels.\n\n\n   In the testimony, Kanji Mimoto, an executive with Ajinimoto Co.\nof Tokyo, said that competitors in the lysine business had engaged\nin price fixing long before Archer Daniels entered the market in\nthe early 1990s. But, he said, Archer Daniels executives were the\nfirst to push efforts to control production volumes, which would\nhelp guarantee the effectiveness of a price-fixing scheme.\n\n\n   Many of the discussions on production floundered, however,\nbecause of insistence by Archer Daniels that it be assigned as much\nvolume as Ajinimoto, then the largest lysine producer in the\nbusiness, Mimoto said.\n\n\n   ``What I remember strongly, was that Terry Wilson said that as a\ncompany policy, ADM must have the same share as the market leader''\nunder such an agreement, he said.\n\n\n   In a later phone call, Mimoto said, Whitacre told him that he\nwas interested in increasing the price, even without a volume\nagreement in place. That call took place before Whitacre began\nworking for the government.\n\n\n   Two recorded calls with Mimoto, made by Whitacre after his\ncooperation began, were played in court. At times in in recording,\nthe men used fictitious names. In the first, the two men haggled\nover how high lysine prices should go. In the second, Mimoto\nexpressed concerns about meeting in the United States because of\npossible legal problems.\n\n\n   ``We know that in the United States the antitrust statutes are\nvery severe,'' he said in the recording. ``So, as much as possible,\nwe wanted to avoid the United States.''\n\n\n   Earlier in the day, Reid Weingarten, a lawyer for Wilson,\npresented his opening statement. In it, he said that the words of\nWilson captured on tape were not what they appeared, largely\nbecause his client was lying to the competitors in an effort to\nbreak up the Asian cartel.\n\n\n   As evidence, he cited a secretly recorded statement made by\nWilson late in the investigation that he said proved there was no\ntrue price-fixing effort. ``If we were trying to fix prices,''\nWeingarten quoted him as saying, ``Then we ought to be fired'' for\nincompetence. &QL;",

Klein and  \nhis criminal enforcement director, Gary Spratling, were to announce \nthe deal at a news conference later today. Asked whether the \ndepartment was settling with two vitamin companies, Reno told her \nweekly news conference this morning, ``An announcement should be \nmade later this morning.'' \n\n\n\tA third company was to be accepted into the leniency program of  \nthe Justice Department's antitrust division under which prosecution \ncan be avoided if the company volunteers evidence of its role in \nprice-fixing before prosecutors learn of it through their \ninvestigations, Justice officials said. \n\n\n\tThe yearlong investigation has looked at whether drug and  \nchemicals companies met to fix prices and carve up markets for \nvitamins such as A, B, C and E. The investigation targeted Roche \nHolding, which controls 40 percent of the market, Rhone Poulenc SA \nof France and BASF AG, along with several smaller U.S. and Japanese \ncompanies, a Wall Street Journal report said. \n\n\n\tThe companies produce the raw ingredients that are sold to  \ncompanies that make vitamins for human or animal use. \n\n\n\tSpokesmen from all three companies said they were cooperating  \nwith the Justice Department. But they refused to say Wednesday when \nthey expected the probe to be completed or a settlement reached. \n\n\n\tIn March, a Swiss vitamin manufacturer and five U.S. executives  \nagreed to plead guilty to participating in a worldwide conspiracy \nto fix the prices of vitamins. The company agreed to pay a $10.5 \nmillion fine. \n\n\n\tThe corporation, Lonza AG, was charged in previously sealed  \ncourt documents with scheming to fix the prices and allocate the \nsales of vitamin B3, also known as niacin and niacinamide, the \ndepartment said. \n\n\n\tThe five executives were charged with plotting to fix prices and  \nallocate customers and sales of vitamin B4, also known as choline \nchloride. \n\n\n\tBoth vitamins are used to enrich human and animal nutritional  \nproducts and are sold around the world. \n\n\n\tThese were the first cases made public from the antitrust  \ndivision's investigation of the vitamin industry.

The investigation and trial have already\nbeen declared hallmarks by the government, which said it upended a\nconspiracy that controlled the prices of $1 billion in commerce\nworldwide.\n\n\n   But the case and Thursday's verdict also has had an enormous\nimpact as well on Archer Daniels _ a food giant that advertises\nitself as the ``supermarket to the world'' because it is a leading\nprocessor of corn, oilseeds and wheat. The Decatur, Ill.-based\ncompany's influence extends to virtually every grocery store aisle.\n\n\n   For decades, it has been run as a virtual family fief under the\niron-fisted control of Dwayne Andreas, one of the nation's most\npolitically powerful executives who is known by presidents and\nprime ministers alike. Despite that influence, Dwayne Andreas was\nunable to stop the weight of the judicial system from falling upon\nhis son and onetime heir apparent, Michael.\n\n\n   Over the seven-week trial, prosecutors presented evidence unlike\nany ever offered in court in a price-fixing case, including audio\nand video recordings of the illegal price-fixing meetings between\nthe defendants and their international competitors who made the\nadditive, known as lysine.\n\n\n   The evidence, including testimony from co-conspirators,\nportrayed price-fixing as common in the industry. Evidence was\noffered pointing to price-fixing in at least one other product, and\nconspiracies among foreign competitors that dated back decades.\n\n\n   The defendants were Michael Andreas, on paid leave from his\nposition of vice chairman with Archer Daniels; Terrance Wilson, a\nformer head of the company's corn-processing division, and Mark\nWhitacre, a former head of its bioproducts division, which\nmanufactures lysine.\n\n\n   Sentencing was set for Jan. 7. The men face a maximum penalty of\nthree years in jail and a $350,000 fine. But the defendants could\nbe forced to pay more, since under the law the government is\nallowed to seek twice the amount gained in the crime or lost by the\nvictims _ in this case, the purchasers of lysine.\n\n\n   Neither Andreas nor Wilson showed any emotion when the jury of\nsix men and six women announced their verdict. They left the\ncourtroom without comment. Whitacre, who waived his right to attend\nthe trial, was not in the courtroom.\n\n\n   Lawyers for Andreas and Wilson said that they would appeal the\nverdict. ``We've been fighting this for three years, and we are\ngoing to continue to fight it,'' said John Bray, a lawyer for\nAndreas. ``We're not through.''\n\n\n   Bill Walker, Whitacre's lawyer, said that he believed that the\njury had reached a conclusion on his client's guilt based in part\non the recorded evidence against the other defendants. ``I hate to\nuse the words `guilt by association,' but that's the way it\nseems,'' he said.\n\n\n   The conviction of Whitacre for price-fixing is the latest turn\nin a series that have bedeviled this case from the beginning. It\nwas Whitacre himself who first alerted the government to\nprice-fixing at Archer Daniels in 1992. For the next two and a half\nyears, he worked as a government informant, secretly recording\nmeetings with competitors and conversations at the highest reaches\nof the politically powerful grain giant.\n\n\n   But, soon after raids on Archer Daniels in 1995, Whitacre was\ndiscredited as a witness and eventually lost his immunity from\nprosecution when it was revealed that he had been secretly taking\nmillions of dollars from the company, even while working as a\ngovernment informant. Whitacre contended that the money was\nprovided as part of an under-the-table bonus plan at the compan",

Several\nclass-action suits brought by large food makers and various other\ngroups could eventually benefit consumers.\n\n\n   The guilty pleas came from Takeda Chemical Industries of Osaka,\nwhich agreed to pay $72 million; the Eisai Co. of Tokyo, which\nagreed to pay $40 million, and the Daiichi Pharmaceutical Co. in\nTokyo, which agreed to pay $25 million, according to the\ngovernment. Takeda is the largest pharmaceutical company in Japan.\nNo executives were charged.\n\n\n   Takeda, which sold vitamins B and C, released a statement late\nThursday saying it deeply regretted the matter and that any\nemployees involved in the case would be disciplined. The company\nsaid all managers, executives, board members and an auditor would\nhave their pay reduced.\n\n\n   Officials at Daiichi, which sold vitamin B, could not be reached\nfor comment.\n\n\n   Cathy Pollini, a spokeswoman at the U.S. subsidiary of Eisai,\nwhich sold vitamin E, said Thursday that she could only confirm\nthat the company was cooperating with the Justice Department's\ninvestigation of anti-competitive practices in the vitamins market.\n\n\n   ``The prosecution of these three Japanese companies further\ndemonstrates the truly international aspect of the vitamin\nconspiracy,'' Joel I. Klein, the assistant attorney general in\ncharge of the antitrust division, said in a statement. ``By\nconspiring to fix the prices and allocate the sales of these\nvitamins, these companies and their co-conspirators reaped hundreds\nof millions of dollars in additional revenues.''\n\n\n   Last May, Hoffmann-LaRoche, a unit of Roche Holding of\nSwitzerland, agreed to pay $500 million and BASF AG of Germany\nagreed to pay $225 million to settle accusations that they\nmaster-minded the vitamin conspiracy, along with Rhone-Poulenc of\nFrance, which was not fined because it cooperated in the early days\nof the government investigation. It was the largest settlement ever\nin a federal antitrust case.\n\n\n   Two Roche executives also pleaded guilty and agreed to serve\njail terms in the United States. One of those executives had misled\ninvestigators in an earlier investigation into price-fixing at\nRoche, the government said.\n\n\n   In late 1998, another vitamin maker, Lonza AG of Switzerland,\nalso pleaded guilty to price fixing in the vitamins market and\nagreed to pay $10.5 million.\n\n\n   The government said Thursday that all three Japanese companies\nand many of their executives were cooperating with the\ninvestigation, which industry experts sai",

Because Rhone-Poulenc cooperated in the\nearly days of the government's investigation, the company avoided\npaying a large sanction.\n\n\n   In securing a settlement last month, government antitrust\nofficials said the decade-long conspiracy affected virtually every\nAmerican household. The vitamin conspirators, who met regularly and\nsometimes referred to themselves as ``Vitamins Inc.,'' fraudulently\ninflated the prices of bulk vitamins that went into everything from\nbreakfast milk and cereal to orange juice, meats, pet food and even\none-a-day vitamins. The vitamins affected were vitamin A, B2, B5,\nC, E and Beta Carotene.\n\n\n   According to people who have been briefed on the negotiations,\nthe three companies _ which dominate the world's vitamins market _\nare eager to end the case, and a settlement is expected to come in\nthe next week or two. Roche is expected to pay the bulk of the\nproposed settlement, up to $500 million, with BASF paying about\n$250 million and Rhone-Poulenc paying about $85 million. The\nclass-action suit is primarily focused on vitamins A, C and E and\nthe proposed settlement is largely determined by market share.\n\n\n   Among the dozens of plaintiffs in the suit are animal feed\nsuppliers, food processors and farmers. One of the earliest\nlawsuits was filed by the J&AMP;R Feed Services, in Cullman, Ala., in\n1997.\n\n\n   If a settlement is agreed to, and people close to the\nnegotiations say the talks could still break down, that would mean\nthat altogether, Roche would have agreed to pay more than $1\nbillion to settle charges that company executives worked in concert\nwith executives at the other major vitamin makers to allocate\nmarkets and fix the prices of human and animal vitamins, thereby\novercharging American farmers and food processors as well as\nconsumers.\n\n\n   In all, the three drug companies, which control as much as 90\npercent of the market for the most popular vitamins, would be\nsaddled with fines of more than $1.5 billion; the companies also\nexpect to face antitrust litigation, scrutiny or sanctions in\nCanada and Europe.\n\n\n   Officials at Roche, which is based in Basel, Switzerland, BASF,\nwhich is based in Germany and Rhone-Poulenc, which is headquartered\nin France, were unavailable for comment.\n\n\n   Lawyers with Boies &AMP; Schiller, the Washington law firm that is\nleading the class-action settlement, declined comment.\n\n\n   A person close to the negotiations, however, said that the\nsettlement talks are moving ahead, and the discussion is\n``primarily about the money.''\n\n\n   In the Justice Department settlement, Roche paid $500 million\nand BASF paid $225 million to settle the case. A former Roche\nofficial, a Swiss citizen who headed the vitamins division, also\nagreed to serve a four-month jail term in the United States, and\ngovernment investigators said that there could be more indictments.\n\n\n   A number of smaller vitamin manufacturers have also pled guilty\nto fixing prices in the market, and Federal investigators say they\nare continuing to investigate what they say was an illegal\ninternational cartel that operated in the vitamins market.\n\n\n   All three companies have said that they have been cooperating\nwith Justice Department officials and publicly hinted that they had\nbeen seeking to settle the class-action lawsuits.

Spratling, deputy assistant attorney general in charge of \nantitrust criminal enforcement. \n\n\n\t``As a member of Hoffmann-La Roche's executive committee at the  \ntime of his involvement, Bronnimann put the full weight of \nlegitimacy behind the company's involvement in the most pervasive \ninternational cartel ever uncovered.'' \n\n\n\tThe government said Bronnimann conspired with counterparts at  \nBASF, Rhone-Poulenc and other unnamed competitors. \n\n\n\tBronnimann is the second former senior Hoffmann-La Roche  \nexecutive to be charged in the continuing investigation. On May 20, \nDr. Kuno Sommer, former director of worldwide marketing for \nHoffmann-La Roche's vitamins and fine chemicals division, was \ncharged with participating in the vitamin cartel and with lying to \nJustice Department investigators in 1997 to cover up the \nconspiracy. \n\n\n\tSommer, also a Swiss citizen and resident, pleaded guilty and  \nwas sentenced July 23 to four months in prison and fined $100,000. \n\n\n\tOn March 2, a third foreign national, Antonio Felix, a Mexican  \ncitizen and vice president for basic and international products at \nDuCoa L.P., agreed to plead guilty to plotting to fix the prices of \nvitamin B4. He has not been sentenced.",

      "content": "TOP ROCHE EXECUTIVES SAY THEY'RE BLAMELESS IN PRICE-FIXING SCHEME \n\n\n\n   BASEL, Switzerland _ One day after admitting that some senior\nexecutives were ringleaders in a nine-year price-fixing cartel for\nvitamins, the chairman and the chief executive of Roche Holding AG\npronounced themselves blameless and clueless Friday.\n\n\n   ``You will understand that this was not part of our\nresponsibility,'' said Franz B. Humer, the chief executive. ``It is\ncertainly not easy to understand the reasons for actions of\nemployees who in secrecy organized a conspiracy of this kind.''\n\n\n   Roche, a pharmaceutical conglomerate based here, was by far the\nbiggest player in what the U.S. Justice Department has described as\na sophisticated cartel to fix worldwide vitamin prices as much as\n25 percent above the market level.\n\n\n   On Thursday, Roche agree to pay $500 million to settle charges\nwith the Justice Department. Two of its top executives resigned,\nand one of them agreed to serve a four-month prison sentence in the\nUnited States.\n\n\n   Friday, at a news conference at company headquarters, both the\nchairman and the chief executive were almost completely at a loss\nto explain how the wrongdoing could have happened _ or what they\nwould do to keep it from happening again.\n\n\n   To be sure, Roche was not alone. BASF AG of Germany agreed to\nsettle similar charges by paying $225 million in fines.\nRhone-Poulenc &UR;  &LR; of France, which was also part of the cartel but\nprovided crucial information to prosecutors, was allowed to escape\npunishment.\n\n\n   But Roche was the undisputed heavyweight, controlling about 40\npercent of the worldwide vitamin market. It also had a history of\nprice fixing: in 1997, the same division that was implicated\nThursday had to pay a $14 million fine for its involvement in\nfixing the price of citric acid and lysine, which are food\nadditives.\n\n\n   The potential liabilities of Roche and BASF were clearly on the\nminds of investors. Roche shares fell 330 Swiss francs, or nearly 2\npercent, to close at 16,670. BASF was down 0.05 euros, to 39.25,\nwhile Rhone-Poulenc was up 1.44 euros, to 48.39.\n\n\n   What makes the Roche case most remarkable is that the executives\nembroiled in the last round of price-fixing were apparently\ninvolved in the latest one as well _ even as Roche was vowing to\nclean up its practices.\n\n\n   Friday, Humer attributed the wrongdoing to what he called the\nsecret machinations of the implicated executives. He insisted that\nthe company had ``never tolerated practices of this kind.'' He\nvowed to start a ``vigorous information campaign'' that would tell\nall employees about ethical practices.\n\n\n   But even as they promised to restore Roche's credibility with\nits corporate customers _ a number of whom have filed suit _ the\nRoche executives could not explain what had happened or why.\n\n\n   ``We don't really know what they did,'' Fritz Gerber, Roche's\nchairman, said. The problem, he said, was that the most important\nsource of information was the Justice Department and that Roche did\nnot have access to the government's evidence.\n\n\n   ``It is clear that there was an elaborate conspiracy that was\nkept entirely secret by a small group of employees,'' Humer said.\nBut, he said, ``we are very reliant on what the Justice Department\nhas published.''\n\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n\n   By all accounts, the conspiracy was sophisticated and global.\nRoche, BASF and Rhone-Poulenc control more than 80 percent of the\nworld vitamin market.\n\n\n   The three companies have admitted forming a cartel in 1990 that\nlasted until this year and that included most of the world's\nsmaller producers.\n\n\n   In its indictment, the Justice Department said that executives\nfrom the companies met secretly to set prices and carve up the\nmarket. According to the government, the conspiracy involved people\nat many levels of management and was operated with the smoothness\nof a single company _ ``Vitamins Inc.,'' in one government\ncharacterization.\n\n\n   The big question Friday was how Roche, which had already run\nafoul of the Justice Departme",

It comes just\nmonths after the companies agreed to pay record fines in settling a\ncriminal complaint from the Justice Department.\n\n\n   The seven companies had been accused in both cases of plotting,\nfor nearly a decade, to artificially inflate the prices of the raw\nvitamin blends that go into everything from milk and breakfast\ncereal to animal feed. The blends involve vitamins A, C and E and a\nvariety of the B-complex vitamins, including beta-carotene.\n\n\n   The class-action case was brought by direct purchasers of bulk\nvitamins, including some of the world's largest food, beverage and\nanimal feed companies, like Kellogg, Kraft and Tyson Foods.\n\n\n   The settlement payments are expected to compensate those\npurchasers, rather than ordinary consumers.\n\n\n   As indirect purchasers of raw vitamin mixtures, consumers have\nbeen overpaying for everything from vitamin tablets to the small\nportions of vitamins added into everyday foods. But although\nlawyers involved in the case say consumers may be compensated as\npart of state class-action suits pending against the vitamin\nmakers, few think any such settlements would be as large as the\nprivate settlement that was announced Wednesday.\n\n\n   The vitamin makers, several of which have already settled\ngovernment charges in Canada, are also facing antitrust\ninvestigations in Europe.\n\n\n   As a result of the conspiracy, which lasted from 1990 to 1998,\nthe seven companies had already agreed to pay nearly $2 billion in\ngovernment and class-action settlements for fixing the prices of\nvitamins in the United States.\n\n\n   The companies that settled Wednesday are Roche of Switzerland,\nBASF of Germany, Rhone-Poulenc of France, Hoechst Marion Roussel of\nGermany, Takeda Chemical of Japan, Eisai Co. of Japan and Daiichi\nPharmaceutical of Japan. The settlement figure represents a penalty\nof about 20 cents on every dollar in sales by the seven companies\nduring the period in question, lawyers involved in the case said.\n\n\n   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)\n\n\n   Most of the companies have previously said that they regretted\ntheir involvement in the conspiracy and would like to put it behind\nthem. But Wednesday, most of the public statements simply\nacknowledged the facts of the settlement.\n\n\n   ``This is a substantial step for us in resolving the pending\nlawsuits,'' a spokesman at BASF said.\n\n\n   Lawyers involved in the class-action case, however, hailed it as\na milestone, one that helped break up an international cartel that\ncontrolled 90 percent of the U.S. vitamin market and more than 70\npercent of the global market and reached virtually every household\nin the world.\n\n\n   ``This case has helped stop a conspiracy that was organized in\nEurope and implemented in the U.S., that fixed prices and carved up\nour markets for about a decade,'' said Jonathan Schiller, a lawyer\nat Boies &AMP; Schiller, one of the firms involved in the suit.\n\n\n   The class-action lawyers are still pursuing suits against a\nsmaller group of vitamin producers that deal in niacin and choline\nchloride.\n\n\n   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)\n\n\n   The case goes back to the mid-1990s, when Justice Department\ninvestigators and private antitrust lawyers began pursuing\naccusations that the big vitamin makers were meeting regularly in\nhotels around the world to fix prices and eliminate competition,\naccording to lawyers involved in the investigation.\n\n\n   The case broke open this year after Rhone-Poulenc stepped\nforward as part of the plea agreement with the Justice Department.\nRoche and BASF then acknowledged taking part in a much broader\nconspiracy that executives sometimes brazenly dubbed Vitamins",

JOSEF HEBERT, Associated Press Writer\n\n\n   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans said they wanted to ''send a\nmessage'' to OPEC oil producers. Democrats called it meaningless\n''feel good fluff.''\n\n\n   But in the end, all but a handful of House members -- Republicans\nand Democrats alike -- voted for a bill Wednesday that both sides\nacknowledged would do little to help Americans deal with the high\ncost of oil, or lower prices.\n\n\n   Instead, the vote may have demonstrated how little power\nCongress has to address the soaring oil and gasoline prices that\ngrip the nation, much less influence foreign oil production plans.\n\n\n   The legislation, although characterized by some lawmakers as\ntepid and inconsequential, passed the House 382-38, marking the\nfirst congressional response to the tripling of oil prices over the\npast 14 months.\n\n\n   The bill, titled the ''Oil Price Reduction Act,'' simply\nrequires the White House to review pricing practices of the\n11-member Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and the\npresident to work with other nations to restrict military\nassistance against countries found to be engaged in petroleum price\nfixing.\n\n\n   Nevertheless, it was touted by supporters as a ''wakeup call''\nand a ''clear message'' to the Clinton administration and OPEC,\nwhich meets next Monday to consider new oil production levels, that\nthis country is angry over the run-up in oil prices.\n\n\n   It ''spotlights OPEC's price-fixing activities,'' declared Rep.\nBenjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., the measure's chief sponsor.\n\n\n   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., ridiculed the measure as ''feel good\nlegislation'' that does little beyond requiring reports --\ndocuments, he added mockingly, that ''already have them quaking in\nKuwait and quivering in Venezuela.''\n\n\n   But when it came time to vote, Frank cast a ''present'' -- not\nwanting to endorse the legislation, but also not eager to be seen\nvoting on the wrong side in the oil cartel versus American consumer\ndebate.\n\n\n   There were 187 Democrats who voted with Republicans for the\nlegislation, including some who were highly critical of the bill\nduring a two-hour debate.\n\n\n   ''Sometimes people laugh at Congress. This is a day for\nlaughing,'' Rep. Martin Frost, D-Texas, declared, chastising the\nRepublican majority for pushing the ''meaningless'' legislation,\nwhich he earlier in a news release described as ''feel good\nfluff.'' Still, Frost voted for the bill.\n\n\n   Senate Republicans, meanwhile, were planning a largely symbolic\nvote of their own on a proposed ''gas tax holiday,'' possibly early\nnext week, in an apparent attempt by the GOP leadership to try to\ngain some political advantage on a high-profile pocketbook issue.\n\n\n   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., this week quietly\nfiled two gasoline tax bills -- one to suspend the 4.3 cent-a-gallon\nincrease that Congress approved in 1993, and another to suspend the\nentire 18.4 cent federal levy -- with a test vote planned for early\nnext week.\n\n\n   Although the Senate cannot initiate tax legislation, the vote\ncould revive efforts to cut the federal gasoline tax. A tax\nrollback recently ran into trouble in the House, where some\nlawmakers said it would take too much money away from highway\nconstruction.\n\n\n   Both sides used Wednesday's House debate for partisan attacks\nover the conduct of America's energy policy.\n\n\n   The bill will show OPEC ''that not all branches of this\ngovernment are asleep at the wheel,'' said Rep. Porter Goss,\nR-Fla., accusing the Clinton administration of sitting by idly for\n18 months as prices soared. Other GOP lawmakers accused the White\nHouse of imposing an energy policy that has stifled domestic oil\nproduction.\n\n\n   Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, the majority whip, accused the\nadministration of ''tin cup diplomacy, running around begging OPEC\nto open their valves'' while accusing the White House of ignoring\ndomestic oil producers.\n\n\n   Democrats shot back that it has been the Republican majority in\nCongress that has blocked legislation promoting",

Klein, who launched\nthe case to break up Microsoft and won record criminal fines\nagainst international price fixers, will leave government at the\nend of this month.\n\n\n   ''The time has come to seek new challenges,'' Klein said in a\nstatement Tuesday. ''I have done what I set out to do here, and our\nwork is on the right track.''\n\n\n   Klein, 53, intends to take time off and then begin a search for\nhis next job, Justice Department spokeswoman Gina Talamona said.\n\n\n   Klein ''will not be wanting for suitors. His job search could be\none of the great auctions,'' predicted Professor William E. Kovacic\nof The George Washington University Law School.\n\n\n   During Klein's tenure, which began Oct. 18, 1996, the government\nblocked or altered about 170 mergers. In 220 criminal price-fixing\ncases, 52 executives were sent to prison, corporations paid $1.7\nbillion in fines and individuals paid another $21 million.\n\n\n   Kovacic ranked Klein among the three most influential chiefs\never to head the Justice Department's antitrust division, along\nwith Thurmond Arnold in the Roosevelt administration of the late\n1930s and early 1940s and William Baxter in the first Reagan\nadministration in the early 1980s.\n\n\n   ''He will be remembered as the man who brought the antitrust\ndivision back into the courtroom after about 15 years of living on\nsettlements, guidelines and speeches,'' Kovacic said.\n\n\n   Klein will leave before the courts render a final verdict on the\nMicrosoft case, but he won the first round. U.S. District Judge\nThomas Penfield Jackson ruled after a trial that Microsoft\nillegally used monopoly power to thwart innovation by competitors\nand ordered it split into two companies.\n\n\n   Microsoft appealed the verdict and the Supreme Court is to\ndecide soon whether to hear the appeal directly, as Klein and\nJackson proposed, or to have the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for\nthe District of Columbia hear the appeal first, as the company\nprefers.\n\n\n   The full impact of Klein's litigation campaign won't be known\nuntil appellate courts finally resolve the Microsoft case and\nKlein's cases against American Airlines for predatory action\nagainst low-cost competitors and against Visa and MasterCard for\nlimiting competition in credit cards.\n\n\n   ''Joel Klein has been a champion for America's consumers. He has\nfought tirelessly for marketplace competition, and Americans have\nenjoyed better products, more choices and lower prices as a\nresult,'' said Attorney General Janet Reno.\n\n\n   In cracking a worldwide vitamin price-fixing cartel, Klein's\ndivision obtained the largest criminal fine in Justice Department\nhistory for any kind of crime: $500 million levied against F.\nHoffmann-La Roche, a Swiss firm. BASF, a German firm, paid a $225\nmillion fine in the vitamin case.\n\n\n   The U.S. firm Archer Daniels Midland paid $100 million for\nfixing the prices of food and feed additives lysine and citric\nacid. For fixing the price of graphite electrodes used in mini\nsteel mills, SGL Carbon AG, a German firm, paid $135 million and\nUCAR, a U.S. firm, paid $110 million.\n\n\n   Opposition from Klein's division led to abandonment of an $11\nbillion merger between Lockheed Martin and Northup Grumman in the\ndefense electronics and strategic aircraft industries. WorldCom and\nSprint dropped their $129 billion telecommunications merger after\nKlein and his staff objected to increased concentration in\nlong-distance, Internet backbone and business data services.\n\n\n   In the last four years, Klein signed antitrust cooperation\nagreements with Australia, Brazil, the European Union, Israel,\nJapan and Mexico.\n\n\n   The department announced that Klein's principal deputy, Doug\nMelamed, 54, will replace him as acting assistant attorney general\nin charge of the antitrust division.\n\n\n AP-NY-09-19-00 1602",
