      "content": "QUEST TO TAME ENERGY OF STARS REVIVES \n\n\n\n   PLAINSBORO, N.J. _ In its heyday it was a palace among physics\nlaboratories, with an enviably fat budget, ample support staff and\nthe prestige that comes to research institutions working at the\ncutting edge in solving global problems. But today, the Princeton\nPlasma Physics Laboratory, still a leader in hydrogen fusion\nresearch, is so short of cash that it can no longer afford even a\nreceptionist.\n\n\n   However, a dry spell of discouragements and spending cuts for\nfusion research may be ending. With their backs to a financial\nwall, specialists in the field are banding together to pursue the\nelusive goal of harnessing thermonuclear fusion, the process that\ndrives the sun and hydrogen bombs.\n\n\n   Leaders in the field say the new spirit calls for lean,\nselective financing of small-scale experiments as well as the large\nones that have dominated the field's history, increased cooperation\nbetween long-standing competitors, and a lot of patience.\n\n\n   Proponents of hydrogen fusion, the joining together of hydrogen\nnuclei to produce useful energy, have suffered too many\nfrustrations over the years to hope for too much too soon. Fusion\nenergy will not come tomorrow. But it could become a reality in the\nmid-21st century, believers say, and slow the carbon dioxide\npollution of the atmosphere by the burning of fossil fuels _ a\nproblem that may be leading to disastrous global warming.\n\n\n   Pressed by tight budgetary constraints imposed by Congress,\ncompeting fusion laboratories have begun sharing and coordinating\ntheir research to a greater extent than ever and have drafted\nguidelines for allocating their limited resources as they would an\ninvestment portfolio, giving major financing to the most promising\nprojects but gambling some funds for high-risk but potentially\nfruitful experiments.\n\n\n   Next month fusion scientists and engineers from around the world\nwill hold a meeting in Snowmass, Colo., to discuss all the devices\nand proposals currently on the table. It will be the first meeting\nof its kind, according to its co-chairman, Dr. Michael E. Mauel of\nColumbia University, and it signals a growing realization that if\nfusion energy is ever to become a reality it will require global\ncooperation rather than endless competition between nations and\nindividual laboratories.\n\n\n   The main obstacle to accelerated research fusion, many\nscientists say, is the disincentive created by low fossil fuel\nprices.\n\n\n   ``Right now,'' said Dr. Robert J. Goldston, director of the\nPrinceton Plasma Physics Laboratory in New Jersey, ``a bottle of\ntable water costs more than a bottle of gasoline. But cheap oil\nwon't last forever, and in any case, the burning of fossil fuels\nmay be contributing to global warming. Fusion, which could produce\nenormous amounts of energy at reasonable cost with only negligible\namounts of radioactive waste and no pollution of the atmosphere,\nmay be our only practical alternative to fossil fuels.''\n\n\n   No one doubts that hydrogen fusion can be achieved. Huge pulses\nof fusion power have already been generated by experimental fusion\nreactors in the United States and Europe. The trouble is that until\nnow, conventional generating plants have had to supply more energy\nto kindle a thermonuclear pulse than the pulse itself produces.\n\n\n   No one has yet been able to squeeze thermonuclear fuel tightly\nenough and long enough to ignite a self-sustaining fusion reaction.\n\n\n   In the sun, energy is produced when hydrogen nuclei fuse to\nproduce helium, a heavier element. But for hydrogen nuclei to\novercome their mutual electrostatic repulsion and get close enough\nto fuse, they must have very high velocities, that is to say, they\nmust be very, very hot.\n\n\n   Scores of different reactor designs have been built, tested and\nabandoned over the years, most of which belong to one of two main\ncategories: magnetic confinement, the squeezing of plasma by\nmagnetic fields; and inertial confinement, the squeezing of hot gas\nby the implosion of miniature hydrogen bombs.\n\n\n   A magnetic confinement device uses",

Its analyses have prevailed\nin lawsuits against the Energy Department, mostly involving\ncontaminated nuclear-weapons plants, and led to out-of-court\nsettlements.\n\n\n   In its new, 92-page report, to be issued Wednesday, the group\nwarns that fusion research like that now under way by the\ngovernment could be used to develop a new generation of hydrogen\nbombs and that it is thus illegal under the test ban. Some 150\ncountries, including the United States, are signers of the treaty.\n\n\n   The Energy Department, which runs the research program, strongly\ndenies the institute's accusation. The department said Tuesday that\nits fusion research would produce no new weapons and instead was\nmeant to help keep the nation's existing nuclear stockpile in good\nworking order, as well as to help harness nuclear fusion for\npeaceful energy production.\n\n\n   Dr. Ray Kidder, a former nuclear-bomb designer at the Lawrence\nLivermore National Laboratory, who reviewed the institute's report\nfor technical accuracy, praised the group's work as rigorous and\nthorough, and said the issue of a possible treaty violation was\nimportant.\n\n\n   ``This question needs to be taken seriously and discussed in an\nopen forum, and some decisions made about it,'' Kidder said in an\ninterview Tuesday. He added that he and two colleagues had prepared\na proposal for limiting pure-fusion research and that the proposal\nwould appear in a coming issue of Physics Today, a professional\njournal.\n\n\n   One of his colleagues, Dr. Frank von Hipple, is a former adviser\nto the Clinton White House who now works at Princeton University.\nHe has warned that pure-fusion research could result in devices\n``compact enough to be used as weapons,'' a prospect taken\nincreasingly seriously.\n\n\n   Dr. Hans Bethe, a Nobel laureate who was a main architect of the\nfirst atomic bomb, a half-century ago, wrote President Clinton last\nyear to warn of the dangers of ``pure-fusion weapons.''\n\n\n   The institute's criticism focuses on a sprawling federal program\nthat, in all, involves a dozen or so new major scientific projects\nat the nation's weapons laboratories and will cost roughly $4.5\nbillion a year for at least 10 years.\n\n\n   The ostensible aim of that program is to shift national efforts\naway from developing nuclear arms and toward maintaining stockpiles\nin good condition, using computer simulations and a battery of\nother advanced techniques to ensure the arsenal's potency.\n\n\n   But the institute says in its report that the fusion-research\naspects of the colossal effort are so ambitious that they violate\nthe Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, long a holy grail of arms\ncontrollers.

      "content": "ENGINEERING STUDIES\n\n\n   Some scientists and engineers have argued that fusion energy is\ninherently impractical because a fusion reactor costing billions of\ndollars would quickly wear out. The flood of very high-energy\nneutrons produced by hydrogen fusion penetrates metal and disrupts\nits crystalline structure, causing it to expand and become\ndangerously brittle. If the neutron bombardment were to reach the\nmetal wall of a reactor's vacuum chamber, the entire chamber could\neventually collapse, destroying the reactor.\n\n\n   Most of the latest reactor plans call for capturing the neutrons\nin a metal ``blanket'' (probably made of lithium) surrounding the\nhot plasma fuel. The neutrons would heat the blanket, and this heat\nwould be transferred to a steam boiler to power a conventional\nturbine. The lithium blanket and some other internal components of\nthe reactor would wear out in a few years, but could be\nperiodically removed and replaced at relatively modest cost. The\nmain part of the reactor would be spared. &QL;\n\n\n   INERTIAL CONFINEMENT\n\n\n   Besides compressing and igniting fusion fuel magnetically, the\nfusion reactions could also be ignited by an implosion as in\nhydrogen bombs.\n\n\n   In an inertial confinement reactor, the mixture of deuterium and\ntritium fuel is encapsulated as a thin frozen coating on the inside\nof tiny plastic hollow spheres. For each shot, a sphere is encased\nin a metal ``hohlraum,'' a chamber about the size of a pencil\neraser placed at the focus point of 192 powerful lasers.\n\n\n   When the lasers hit the hohlraum, it emits a blast of X-rays\nthat vaporize and compress the fuel sphere it encloses, imploding\nthe sphere and raising the temperature of the fuel inside it to the\nignition point, 100 million degrees Celsius or so. During the brief\nfusion reaction that ensues, the immense energy it produces is\nabsorbed by a surrounding metal ``blanket,'' which transfers heat\nto a steam-powered electric generating plant.\n\n\n   This will be the basis of the $1.2 billion National Ignition\nFacility under construction at Lawrence Livermore National\nLaboratory in California. Because experiments using the machine\nwill help to monitor the combat readiness of America's arsenal of\nnuclear weapons, part of its financing comes from the Department of\nEnergy weapons program. &QL;\n\n\n   Z PINCH\n\n\n   A variant of inertial confinement fusion called a ``Z pinch'' is\nunder development at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque,\nN.M.\n\n\n   This device would implode little thermonuclear fuel capsules\nlike those the Livermore laboratory is developing, but without\nlasers. Instead, scientists have invented a cylindrical array of\nvery fine tungsten wires and a gigantic capacitor, a device that\ncan store and instantaneously discharge huge electric charges.\n\n\n   When the Sandia capacitor is fired, it sends a current of 20\nmillion amperes through the fine wires in the Z pinch, and the\nwires are converted into super-hot plasma. The plasma is driven\ninward upon itself by the huge magnetic field produced by the\nsudden current. The collision of the imploding plasma generates a\ngigantic X-ray pulse and this, it is hoped, can implode fuel\ncapsules to reach ignition.\n\n\n   The Z pinch and a more powerful successor planned by Sandia, the\nX-1, will not ignite a sustained reaction but should produce a\npulse of fusion.",

      "content": "SYSTEMS DESIGNED TO HOLD A HOMEMADE SUN \n\n\n\n   Scientists have developed a variety of devices and systems in\nwhich they hope to be able to compress hydrogen to the densities\nand temperatures needed to sustain thermonuclear fusion reactions.\nAmong them are these: &QL;\n\n\n   TOKAMAKS\n\n\n   Tokamaks, reactors that are shaped like doughnuts and occupy\nlarge buildings, are chambers from which air has been removed and\ninto which is injected a diffuse plasma of hydrogen isotopes,\nespecially mixtures of deuterium and tritium. The plasma, a hot,\nelectrically charged gas, is compressed within the doughnut by two\nsets of magnetic fields, one in which the magnetic field circles\nthe doughnut the long way around and the other in which the\nmagnetic field lines run the short way around the doughnut tube.\n\n\n   By varying the geometry and strength of the fields, they can be\nadjusted to produce a uniform compressive force on the plasma. But\neven with uniform compression, turbulence and instabilities develop\nin a tokamak's plasma, cooling it and enormously complicating the\ngoal of achieving sustained fusion.\n\n\n   To ignite fusion, the compressed plasma in a tokamak must be\nraised to the temperature of the Sun, and various strategies have\nbeen developed for this. Part of the necessary heating is achieved\nsimply by compressing the plasma. Another technique involves\npassing an electric current through the plasma, thus heating it in\nthe same way electricity heats a toaster wire.\n\n\n   Heating can also be achieved by ducting microwave energy into\nthe plasma, and another technique heats the plasma by shooting\nbeams of neutral particles into it from an accelerator. Once fusion\nis initiated, helium ions (also called alpha particles) produced by\nthe fusion of hydrogen nuclei transfer their energy to the plasma\nand help to heat it.\n\n\n   Dozens of tokamaks have been built and tested in many countries.\nAlthough the United States withdrew from a project called the\nInternational Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor _ a huge tokamak\nthe planning for which has already consumed $1 billion _ Russia,\nEurope and Japan are continuing some work on the machine. But\nprospects for financing the project to completion seem bleak.\n\n\n   Meanwhile, the largest existing tokamaks continue to produce\nimpressive fusion pulses. The Joint European Torus in England\nachieved a record for fusion power in a burst of 20 million watts. &QL;\n\n\n   SPHERICAL TORUS MACHINES\n\n\n   These are similar to tokamaks, in that they compress plasma fuel\nwithin toruses using interlocking magnetic fields. But they have\nmuch thinner cores than ordinary tokamaks, giving them a shape more\nsimilar to that of an apple than a doughnut. Their more or less\nspherical shape permits more efficient compression of plasma than\ncan be achieved in a conventional tokamak.\n\n\n   A small spherical torus built and tested in Britain has already\nproved to have a very high ratio of plasma compression to magnetic\nfield strength. Improving this ratio is a major goal of all\nmagnetic confinement fusion devices.\n\n\n   The Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory has built a somewhat\nlarger spherical torus reactor that is scheduled to begin an\nexperimental program in August. Scientists believe that this type\nof reactor, with a tight magnetic field passing through its core,\nmay be able to compress plasma and reach fusion conditions more\ncheaply than is possible with conventional tokamaks.\n\n\n   Princeton's National Spherical Torus Experiment will not achieve\nfusion, but it will allow operators to experiment with a wide\nvariety of conditions. &QL;\n\n\n   STELLARATORS\n\n\n   Like tokamaks, these are more or less doughnut shaped, but their\nmagnetic fields are designed to shape the compressed plasma into a\nwarped helix with many kinks. Unlike a tokamak, a stellarator need\nnot be perfectly symmetrical. Its configuration is believed to\ncontrol plasma turbulence more efficiently than does a tokamak. Oak\nRidge National Laboratory and the Princeton laboratory hope to get\nfederal financing next year to build a small stellarator of\nadvanced design. &QL",

Michael Campbell, associate director for lasers at Lawrence\nLivermore National Laboratory in Livermore, Calif., left his\nposition but remains an employee of the laboratory on leave, a\nlaboratory spokesman said. Campbell is recognized as one of the\nworld's leading experts in ultra-high-energy lasers.\n\n\n   Livermore's director, Dr. Bruce Tarter, said Campbell's\nresignation had been for strictly personal reasons.\n\n\n   The Livermore laboratory, operated by the Department of Energy,\nconducts research in nuclear weapons and nonmilitary projects,\nincluding the development of nuclear fusion as a source of power.\n\n\n   Campbell held a pivotal position at Livermore as director of a\n$1.2 billion program to build the National Ignition Facility, which\nwill conduct research in weapons and fusion and play an important\nrole in assuring that America's aging nuclear arsenal is ready for\na war.\n\n\n   The main weapons research at the installation will focus on the\nStockpile Stewardship and Management Program, which monitors the\nreadiness of the nation's nuclear warheads, in part with\nmathematical models and laboratory experiments. Since the signing\nof the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in 1993, the United States has\nbarred test explosions of real nuclear weapons, and has sought to\ndevelop alternative methods of testing.\n\n\n   Campbell will be replaced by George Miller, Livermore's\nassociate director for national security. Miller is expected to\nundertake a far-reaching evaluation of the status of the National\nIgnition Facility.\n\n\n   Jeff Richardson, a laboratory spokesman, said Monday that\nCampbell had falsely allowed the laboratory to believe he had a\ndoctorate from Princeton University, but that Campbell's reasons\nfor resigning had nothing to do with the installation.\n\n\n   ``In fact,'' Richardson said, ``Mike had completed his Ph.D.\ncourse work when he joined Livermore in 1977, but he never finished\nhis dissertation.''\n\n\n   Asked whether a doctorate was required for holding Campbell's\nposition, Richardson said, ``We require all senior managers to hold\na doctorate or its equivalent in experience.''\n\n\n   He added that Livermore's former director, John Nuckolls, did\nnot have a doctorate.\n\n\n   Livermore press releases during the last several years have\nalways referred to Campbell as Dr. Campbell, and he apparently did\nnothing to correct the title.\n\n\n   Campbell could not be reached for comment either at his office\nor his home in Danville, Calif.\n\n\n   The author of many scientific papers, Campbell received the\nDepartment of Energy's 1985 Excellence in Weapons Research Award,\nthe 1990 American Physical Society's Award for Excellence in Plasma\nPhysics, and the 1994 E.O.

This allows the engine to\nburn cooler and leaner (that is, with more air in the mix).\n\n\n   The device is quite simple: Fuel enters a chamber, mixes with\nair, and then is zapped with electricity. That creates a plasma _\nan electrically-charged gas _ which then causes carbon from the\nfuel to join with oxygen from the air. This leaves a mixture of\ncarbon monoxide and hydrogen, both of which can be burned up by the\nengine.\n\n\n   ``It's well known that hydrogen improves the environmental\nqualities'' of a conventional engine, said Cohn, who is director of\nMIT's Plasma Science and Fusion center. The hard part has always\nbeen producing the hydrogen.\n\n\n   Although the first tests of the device connected to a\nconventional engine are just beginning at the US Department of\nEnergy's Oak Ridge National Laboratory, calculations based on lab\ntests of the device by itself show that it should reduce nitrogen\noxide emissions _ a major component of smog _ by 90 percent. ``A\nnumber of major car companies have talked to us,'' he said, ``both\nUS and foreign.'' But he said it would not be appropriate to name\nthe companies at this early stage of discussions.\n\n\n   ``The principle of what he's talking about is sound and\nattractive,'' said Daniel Sperling, director of the Center for\nAdvanced Automotive Research at the University of California at\nDavis. But, he said, there are some unanswered questions, such as:\nhow cheaply can it be manufactured, and what kind of maintenance\nissues might it encounter?\n\n\n   But an even bigger question, Sperling said, is how much need\nthere is for such a device in the first place. Since new cars _ and\nespecially the newer cars coming in the next few years _ are\nalready vastly cleaner than their predecessors, ``the demand for a\ndevice of this kind is not nearly as great as 10 years ago.''\n\n\n   The progress _ which Sperling attributes in large part to strict\nregulations such as California's air-quality rules _ has been far\ngreater than virtually anyone expected. ``The new cars, for all\npractical purposes, are zero-emitting,'' he said. ``It's\nextraordinary what they've done.''\n\n\n   Cohn agrees that the new cars are much cleaner, but points out\nthat the major companies are still spending hundreds of millions of\ndollars in a quest for even cleaner cars. Also, some trucks and\nbuses _ where much greater improvements are needed because their\nlarger engines produce more emissions _ run on conventional\nspark-ignition engines, and thus could use the new device.\n\n\n   Besides offering cleaner emissions during ordinary operation,\nsaid Cohn, with his device the engine can be set to run on\nvirtually pure hydrogen during startup _ the period when the\ngreatest emission of pollutants usually occurs, because the car's\ncatalytic converter has not yet warmed up to its operating\ntemperature. Those startup emissions would be drastically reduced\nby such a system, he said. Already, Volvo has been working on a\ndifferent technique for providing pure hydrogen to the engine\nduring this startup period.\n\n\n   ``This device could greatly reduce air pollution from cars,\ntrucks, and buses, using present internal combustion technology,\nwithout a major increase in costs and without any inconvenience to\nthe driver,'' Cohn said.\n\n\n   But that's just one of the potential benefits of the device,\nCohn said in an interview. Dubbed the ``microplasmatron,'' it could\nalso allow a variety of unconventional or unrefined fuels _\nincluding natural gas, diesel, and even ordinary vegetable oil _ to\nbe used in car engines.

The\nBallard cell is simply refueled with compressed hydrogen when it\nruns low.\n\n\n   If the skeptic in you is wondering where these cars with Ballard\nfuel cells are and where this compressed hydrogen will come from,\nconsider this: DaimlerChrysler has a prototype car on the road in\nGermany and plans to put fuel cell cars on the market by 2004,\nalong with Toyota and General Motors.\n\n\n   Shell, Texaco and Arco are working on developing the fuel\ninfrastructure with compressed hydrogen necessary to run these\ncars.\n\n\n   Sound too good to be true? Considering that it was developed by\na few scientists and engineers working for next to nothing in a\nlittle Canadian town, such an energy source does seem almost\nunbelievable.\n\n\n   Which makes for a terrific book, written by journalist Tom\nKoppel.\n\n\n   ``The Ballard fuel cell promises nothing less than to solve some\nof the world's worst air pollution problems,'' he writes. ``Yet, it\nall began with a handful of people working on shoestring budgets\nfor a tiny Canadian company, Ballard Power Systems, in a\nlittle-known city of North Vancouver.''\n\n\n   Development and implementation of the Ballard fuel cell is\ndiscussed in Koppel's book, ``Powering the Future: The Ballard Fuel\nCell and the Race to Change the World'' (John Wiley &AMP; Sons, 276\npages).\n\n\n   Geoffrey Ballard, a citizen of Canada and the United States\nthrough his parents, did not set out to find an environmentally\nfriendly energy source, Koppel writes. Ballard became interested in\nthe idea when he was director of research for the newly formed\nconservation office of the Army during the energy crisis of 1973.\n\n\n   Ballard quickly realized that conservation was not a practical\nmeans to solve air pollution problems or U.S. dependence on foreign\noil. Instead, a cleaner energy source had to be discovered, he\ndecided.\n\n\n   So Ballard quit his well-paid job to start a company to create\nsuch an energy source. Tight money forced Ballard and his wife and\nchildren to start a restaurant to finance his dream, Koppel writes\nas he deftly chronicles the ups and downs of such an\nentrepreneurial effort.\n\n\n   ``In short, taking the Ballard fuel cell to where it is today\ntook inspiration, perspiration, and a heavy dose of serendipity,''\nhe writes.\n\n\n   Interestingly, as the company began to succeed, so did its\nstock. Now 35 percent owned by DaimlerChrysler and Ford, Ballard\nPower Systems stock is up tenfold in the past three years. Daimler\nand Ballard also agreed to create a separate company called Ballard\nAutomotive that would be owned jointly and would market the fuel\ncells and fuel cell engines made by DBB.\n\n\n   Although Ballard is a millionaire several times over, money may\nbe the least of his interests.\n\n\n   As he told students graduating from the University of Victoria,\nBritish Columbia: ``Do not be patient. All things to do not come to\nthose who wait. Challenge the normal. Question conventional wisdom.\n... Dare to be in a hurry to change things for the better.''\n\n\n   Ballard was in a hurry, and his urgency may help us all breathe\na little better.\n\n\n   (Visit the Star-Telegram's online services on the World Wide\nWeb: www.star-telegram.com) &QL; \nnn",

      "content": "FIRM'S `SNIFFER' UNITS FRAGRANT WITH POTENTIAL\n\n\n\n   LOS ANGELES -- Five years ago, over frankfurters and beer at a\nhot dog stand, aerospace consultants David Haberman and David\nWalker decided to take a chance.\n\n\n   The pair had learned of a technology developed at Sandia\nNational Laboratory in New Mexico and available for\ncommercialization that used an air-sniffing computer chip to detect\nhydrogen gas. Believing hydrogen would play a growing role in\nindustry, and that existing sensors were too expensive and bulky to\nkeep pace, Walker and Haberman created DCH Technology Inc. to bring\nthe technology to market.\n\n\n   The rest, as they say, is history.\n\n\n   Well, not quite. After five years, the Valencia-based company's\nthree standard-bearer products are starting to gain acceptance. But\nso far, DCH has generated little in the way of sales, with 1998\nrevenues of $215,000 and a net loss of more than $4 million. The\ncompany's stock, which peaked as high $8.25 following its initial\npublic offering in 1996, closed Friday at $1.\n\n\n   Still, Walker and Haberman say they are confident of the firm's\nprospects. ``We have no debt, the founders remain in control of the\ncompany and our products are quite good,'' said Haberman, DCH's\nchairman and vice president of planning.\n\n\n   At least a few others agree. James Stock's Stock Tips, a Las\nVegas-based investor newsletter, declared the company was ``farther\nalong than they've ever been to meeting their corporate goals'' and\nsaid it may be one of the market's best-kept secrets.\n\n\n   At the heart of the DCH game plan is the sensor chip itself.\nDeveloped at Sandia, a U.S. Department of Energy research lab, it\nconsists of a thin layer of palladium nickel alloy sandwiched on\ntop of an integrated circuit. When it comes into contact with\nhydrogen atoms, even at minute levels, the alloy spits protons\ndirectly into the integrated circuit's logic cells.\n\n\n   Using that same basic technology, DCH has developed a hand-held\ndevice for hunting down leaks, a model for installation on\nhydrogen-powered devices, and a version for use in permanent\nlocales where hydrogen might seep out, such as at a nuclear power\nplant or waste-treatment center. Together, the three applications\nhave a potential market of $200 million, the company estimates.\n\n\n   By outsourcing the manufacturing of the sensors to industrial\ngiant Allied Signal, DCH has managed to keep its staff and capital\ninvestments down. The company's staff of 11 consists primarily of\nengineers working to refine the sensor and develop new\napplications.\n\n\n   Haberman and Walker, meanwhile, have been working to\nestablishing relationships with a bevy of blue chip names they hope\nwill result in 1999 sales of between $3 million and $4 million. A\nDCH sensor flew aboard a NASA space shuttle mission last year to\ntest the device's extraterrestrial applications. Westinghouse\nrecently certified the technology for use at a Russian nuclear\npower plant it is retrofitting. And Northrup Grumman Corp. is using\nDCH products in its metallurgy division. Other customers include\nFord Motor Co., Lockheed Martin Defense Systems and the U.S. Naval\nMedical Research Institute.\n\n\n   Still, the fact remains that demand for hydrogen sensors of any\nsort is limited. While the element is a key ingredient in the fuel\ncells that environmentalists believe will one day power cars,\nhydrogen sensor sales currently total in the thousands worldwide,\nnot millions. But if just two or three companies opted to include\nDCH devices on a broad basis -- say, in every fuel-cell car Ford\nproduces -- it would mean a windfall for the company, Haberman\nsaid.\n\n\n   With increased sniffing of DCH by investors and customers alike,\nHaberman said things look positive. ``We've been distinctly poor at\ncommunications . . . but the neat part is the phone keeps ringing''\nfrom potential customers, he said. ``It just seems like\neverything's clicking and coming together.''\n\n\n   X X X",

It uses the reaction of\nhydrogen and oxygen to generate a continuous stream of electricity\nfor days on end with no help whatsoever from a battery.\n\n\n   Fuel cells were once seen as future power sources for cars,\nbuses and power stations, but inventors are now proposing them for\nthe subkilowatt world of portable electronics. They may soon come\nto the aid of soldiers, police officers and even everyday commuters\nwho are weary of the inconvenience of their battery packs,\nrechargers and spare AAs.\n\n\n   Some experts say the latest fuel cells may provide a power\nsource that weighs far less, and lasts far longer, than any battery\non the market, in part because of their efficient use of hydrogen.\n\n\n   ``Fuel cells have a simply amazing ability to extract energy\nfrom the hydrogen atom,'' said Dr. Christopher Dyer, a senior\nmember of the technical staff at Motorola Labs in Tempe, Ariz., who\nis the inventor of a fuel cell designed for use in portable\nelectronic devices.\n\n\n   The principle of every hydrogen-based fuel cell is that when\nhydrogen is joined to oxygen, forming water, energy is produced.\nThe energy takes the form of electricity and some waste heat. The\nbyproducts, depending on the source of the hydrogen, are a bit of\nwater vapor and, often, carbon dioxide, which is vented from the\nfuel cell.\n\n\n   Give the fuel cells enough hydrogen, plus the oxygen that is\nprovided free in the atmosphere, Dyer said, and they could power\ndevices like cell phones for days, weeks or even months. The\nhydrogen that drives these small marvels will probably be provided\nby methanol, a compound commonly known as wood alcohol that\ncontains hydrogen, Dyer said.\n\n\n   ``A liter of methanol should provide enough electricity to run a\nlaptop for more than a week,'' Dyer said. ``A lithium ion battery\nof comparable volume has a tenth of that energy.'' Lithium ion\nbatteries, commonly used in laptops, each provide about three hours\nof energy.\n\n\n   Fuel cells have another advantage besides a high energy output,\nDyer said. They can be replenished quickly, unlike batteries, which\nrequire a slow recharging. Dyer imagines that owners of cell\nphones, laptops and pagers will someday refuel their devices by\noccasionally slipping in a new ampul of methanol.\n\n\n   ``Methanol is inexpensive,'' Dyer said. ``Ampuls of it could be\nbought from a supermarket.''\n\n\n   Fuel cells are not new devices, although the intense recent\ninterest in them is. They were demonstrated in the 19th century and\ndeployed more than a century later to power NASA's space vehicles.\nBut the internal processing required to produce that continuous\nstream of electricity high in the sky proved too expensive for\ndaily applications.\n\n\n   That is changing now, as engineering advances have gradually\nlowered costs. At the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency in\nArlington, Va., Robert Nowak, a program manager, said research\nsponsored by the agency would aid the overladen American soldiers\nwho routinely carry 20 to 30 pounds of batteries on their missions.\n\n\n   ``Fuel cells begin to look very attractive when you consider\nwhat you need in the equivalent battery power to run a computer,\nradio and other gear soldiers must often take with them,'' he said.\n\n\n   But Nowak has not entirely banished batteries from the fuel\ncells his agency has helped to develop. Like many people in the\nfield, he supports a hybrid, or dual, system that uses both a\nbattery and a small fuel cell. The battery provides peaks of power\nwhen needed, and the fuel cell keeps the battery recharged.\n\n\n   ``In principle this means you will only add fuel to the cell\nfrom time to time,'' Nowak said. ``The battery will supply any\ntransient power that exc",

With\nconsumption growth, the situation is getting worse, the report\nwarned.\n\n\nThen what should be done? \"Sustainable energy can be used as an\ninstrument for creating rural jobs, e.g. through bioenergy, and\nnew technologies offer opportunities for affordable and vastly\nimproved energy services,\" said Thomas B.

Decentralized sources\nof electricity would make possible entrepreneurial and small-scale\nbusiness ventures, the report added.\n\n\n\"Wind power is technologically ready to be deployed as a major\noption for providing electricity,\" said the report. Photovoltaic\ncells in small-scale, stand-alone power applications and solar\nthermal electric power today provide important renewable energy\nsupply options.

But its\nexpected construction costs at the Lawrence Livermore National\nLaboratory have doubled to $2.1 billion, and critics in Congress\nhave begun to wonder aloud if the project is worthwhile.\n\n\n   Since 1992, when the United States abandoned nuclear tests, the\nnational laboratories have vied to devise ways to simulate nuclear\nexplosions in hopes that these methods will allow them to determine\nwhether stockpiled warheads are still usable.\n\n\n   Officials at the Energy Department, which runs both Sandia in\nAlbuquerque and Lawrence Livermore in Livermore, Calif., publicly\nrebuked Sandia, saying its criticism was inaccurate and, in any\nevent, should not have been made in public.\n\n\n   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said the Sandia criticism was\n``totally out of line and inconsistent with the nation's stockpile\nstewardship policies.''\n\n\n   Richardson said the cost overruns would be handled with money\nfrom defense programs, and largely within Livermore's existing\nbudget.\n\n\n   ``The labs are very competitive with each other, and this\noutburst is typical lab belly-aching that is sometimes aimed at\njockeying for appropriations at the expense of each other,''\nRichardson said. ``While we have contained the rivalries in the\npast, it seems that NIF is too big a pot to ignore.''\n\n\n   Under pressure, Sandia tempered its stance late Thursday,\nissuing a more conciliatory statement on the project.\n\n\n   But opponents of the laser seized on the original statement to\nadvance their argument that the project was unworkable. ``The\nobjections have been echoing around the weapons complex for the\nlast couple of years,'' said Christopher Paine, a senior researcher\nat the Natural Resources Defense Council. ``They're now being\npublicly stated.''\n\n\n   The National Ignition Facility would consist of 192 individual\nlaser beams converging on a tiny pellet of nuclear fuel to generate\nfusion energy _ a vastly scaled-down version of one element of a\nhydrogen bomb.\n\n\n   The laser, like other parts of the stockpile stewardship program\nat Sandia, Livermore and Los Alamos National Laboratory, would\nallow scientists to approach the harsh conditions in bombs for\nstudy. But the project, which has been under construction since\n1997, has encountered a series of problems, including the\nresignation of its director, construction delays and ballooning\ncosts.\n\n\n   Those problems led to the critical statement on Tuesday from Tom\nHunter, a senior vice president for defense programs at Sandia.\n\n\n   Delays and overruns at the laser project ``will disrupt the\ninvestment needed to be made at the other laboratories,'' Hunter\nsaid. ``This causes us to question what is a reasonable additional\ninvestment in the NIF.''\n\n\n   Even though Sandia had contacted reporters with those\ncriticisms, the statement Thursday called their release\ninadvertent. Hunter is quoted in the release as saying that\n``public divisiveness is not helpful in finding good solutions,''\nbut he did not directly contradict the criticisms.\n\n\n   Rod Geer, a Sandia spokesman, said that ``the concern still\nexists'' on how the various parts of the stockpile stewardship\nprogram will fit together financially.\n\n\n   Clay Sell, a staff member on the Senate Appropriations\nCommittee, said that the cost overruns were placing the project in\njeopardy. ``Absolutely, it's in danger as a program,'' Sell said.\n\n\n   Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, who is a member of the committee, said,\n``the project's costs appear to be rising sky-high,'' adding that\n``Congress needs to take more decisive action to prevent further\nmoney down the drain.''\n\n\n   Richardson said, ``W",

      "content": "WORLD MOVING SLOWLY TOWARD ENERGY FREE OF CARBON \n\n\n\n   Even as the world's expanding population and economy increase\natmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide that scientists say\nare warming the earth, the global energy system is moving steadily\naway from the carbon-rich fuels whose combustion produces the gas.\n\n\n   Experts say that atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide may be\ndouble those of the pre-industrial era by the end of the next\ncentury. But they also say the levels would be much higher except\nfor a trend toward lower-carbon fuels that has been going on for\nmore than 100 years, but has been largely unnoticed except by a\nsmall band of energy specialists.\n\n\n   The question now, they say, is whether the trend can be\naccelerated enough to stave off or lessen what many scientists\nbelieve is a potentially disruptive global warming.\n\n\n   For nearly a century and a half, fuels with high amounts of\ncarbon have progressively been replaced by those containing less.\nFirst wood, which is high in carbon, was eclipsed in the late 19th\ncentury by coal, which contains less. Then oil, with a lower carbon\ncontent still, dethroned King Coal in the 1960s.\n\n\n   Now analysts say that natural gas, lighter still in carbon, may\nbe entering its heyday, and that the day of hydrogen _ providing a\nfuel with no carbon at all, by definition _ may at last be about to\ndawn.\n\n\n   As a result, the experts estimate, the world's economy today\nburns less than two-thirds as much carbon per unit of energy\nproduced as it did in 1860. In the United States, they estimate,\nthe trend toward lower-carbon fuels combined with greater energy\nefficiency has, since 1950, reduced by about half the amount of\ncarbon spewed out for each unit of economic production.\n\n\n   But because economic growth and population growth have been so\nrapid over the decades, overall atmospheric concentrations of\ncarbon dioxide have steadily risen, to the point that the\nconcentrations may well have doubled by the year 2100. Mainstream\nscientists say that this much carbon dioxide could warm the earth,\non average, by 3 to 5 degrees Fahrenheit. By comparison, that is\nabout half as much as it has warmed since the depths of the last\nice age 18,000 to 20,000 years ago. A change of this magnitude\nwould likely have widespread consequences for the world's climate,\nweather and human life.\n\n\n   Now, as representatives of 150 governments meet in Bonn,\nGermany, in the latest round of global talks on measures to further\nreduce carbon-dioxide emissions, analysts both in and out of\nindustry say that the next quarter-century is shaping up as a\nperiod of technological and economic ferment offering a chance to\naccelerate the trend toward a low-carbon economy and, eventually, a\nno-carbon one.\n\n\n   In Bonn, the delegates are trying to work out the details of an\nagreement forged two years ago in Kyoto, Japan, that could speed up\nthe trend. Their work is not expected to be finished for at least a\nyear, and the Kyoto agreement still must be ratified by a\nsufficient number of countries after that.\n\n\n   However that may turn out, ``the decarbonization of the energy\nsystem is the single most important fact to emerge from the last 20\nyears of analysis'' of the system, said Dr. Jesse Ausubel, an\nexpert on energy and climate at Rockefeller University in New York\nCity. He predicts that this evolution will produce a carbon-free\nenergy system by the end of the 21st century.\n\n\n   Among some recent signs of the trend are these:\n\n\n   _ The federal Energy Information Administration reported last\nweek that emissions of carbon dioxide by the United States had\nincreased by an average of 1.37 percent a year in the 1990s _ only\nabout half the 2.6-percent rate of growth in economic production.\nAnalysts say the discrepancy is evidence that the economy is being\ndecoupled from carbon.\n\n\n   _ The agency reported this month that the same is generally true\nin China, the biggest consumer and producer of coal in the world,\nwhere coal production has been reported to be dropping lately.\n``China has dispelled a commonly held notion th",

If a cloud begins\nto contract because of its own gravity, its interior heats up as\ngravitational energy is converted to heat energy, reaching millions\nof degrees, and nuclear reactions begin that change one element\ninto another, releasing energy.\n\n\n   The pressure tends to expand the cloud back out, Walborn said,\nbut eventually equilibrium is reached. ``That is what a star is,''\nhe said, ``a mass of gas at equilibrium between gravity's inward\npressure and outward pressure from nuclear reactions.''\n\n\n   A star has a finite lifetime because it is burning fuel. For 90\npercent of its life, it burns hydrogen into helium.

(AP) -- Armed only with encyclopedia diagrams and a  \nfew college courses in physics, Howard Morland set out 20 years ago \nto discover the secret of the hydrogen bomb. \n\n\n\tHe came close, so close that the federal government fought to  \nstop the Madison-based magazine The Progressive from publishing his \nfree-lance article, ``The H-Bomb Secret: How We Got It, Why We're \nTelling It.'' \n\n\n\tThe Cold War was still on and federal officials were worried  \nabout the national security risk of letting the bomb secrets out of \nthe bag. \n\n\n\tAfter The Progressive refused a request that it censor the  \narticle itself, the government went to court. On March 9, 1979, it \nwon a temporary restraining order under the 1954 Atomic Energy Act \nthat delayed publication for six months. \n\n\n\tThe government said the article threatened ``grave, direct,  \nimmediate and irreparable harm to the national security of the \nUnited States,'' even though it conceded that individual components \nof the article, gleaned from public libraries and tours of nuclear \nfacilities, were not restricted. \n\n\n\tThe issue might seem melodramatic in today's era of freewheeling  \ninformation dissemination across the Internet, where people can \neasily access ``The Terrorist's Handbook'' or ``The Anarchist \nCookbook'' on the World Wide Web. Several Web pages deal with \nmaking hydrogen or atomic bombs. \n\n\n\tBut The Progressive case was only the second in American history  \nthat temporarily upheld prior restraint of publication. The first \ninvolved the Nixon administration's attempt to stop newspapers from \nprinting the Pentagon Papers, the classified study of U.S. \ninvolvement in Vietnam -- which the U.S. Supreme Court eventually \nallowed to be published. \n\n\n\tThere have been prior restraint cases since 1979, but none based  \non national security, said David Rudenstine, a law professor at \nCardozo Law School in New York. \n\n\n\tEditors of The Progressive argued that none of the information  \nin their article was really secret and that the piece would help \ndemystify nuclear theory. \n\n\n\t``We realized that by not breaking any laws, not getting any  \nscientist drunk, not getting any government secrets, you could \nfigure out the deepest, darkest secret that the government must \nsurely have, such as how to build a hydrogen bomb,'' said Sam Day, \nThe Progressive's managing editor at the time. \n\n\n\tDay, 72, still a writer in Madison, said the article didn't  \nenable anyone to actually build a hydrogen bomb, since that costs \n``billions and billions of dollars.'' \n\n\n\tThe Progressive eventually prevailed, but by then the government  \nhad dropped its case because another publication had printed key \nbomb-making steps. \n\n\n\tMorland says he pursued the article as a ``missionary or  \nevangelist'' in the campaign to abolish nuclear weapons. \n\n\n\t``My motivation was a very strongly held belief that the entire  \nhuman race ... had discovered that the creator had played a huge \njoke on us,'' Morland said in a telephone interview from his home \nin Arlington, Va. \n\n\n\t``When we got smart enough to figure out nuclear forces, would  \nwe be wise enough to handle that knowledge? It's a test and there \nis only one right answer: permanent abolition of nuclear weapons \nfor all time,'' said Morland, 56. \n\n\n\tThe historical consequences of the Progressive case have been  \nmodest because it never reached the Supreme Court or challenged the \nboundaries of the Atomic Energy Act, but it did have implications \nfor freedom of the press. \n\n\n\t``This was a significant victory for the magazine and a  \nsignificant victory for the First Amendment,'' said Brady \nWilliamson, a lawyer for The Progressive. ``Practically speaking, \nthe government cannot prevent journalists from writing articles \nbased on essentially accurate information.'' \n\n\n\tPublication didn't have any apparent impact on nuclear  \nproliferation. \n\n\n\t``It surely hasn't led to anyone reading his article and buying  \na book and then designing a hydrogen bomb. So it didn't do what",

The \nprime controllers on two of the three main engines were knocked out \nby the half-second short, and the backup controllers kicked in. \n\n\n\tCollins discovered a popped circuit breaker aboard Columbia late  \nSaturday, which leads NASA to believe the short occurred either in \nthe engine controller or in the electrical wiring that leads to it. \n\n\n\tBecause the three main engines are not used after propelling the  \nshuttle into orbit, neither problem will affect the rest of \nColumbia's five-day flight, Hale said. \n\n\n\tCollins and her crew went about their business Sunday,  \nconducting science experiments and chatting by ham radio with the \nthree cosmonauts on Mir, as flight controllers in Massachusetts \nkept track of the free-flying Chandra X-ray Observatory and flight \ncontrollers in Houston pored over the shuttle engine data. \n\n\n\t``There's always risk in space flight,'' Collins told a radio  \ninterviewer. ``Our job is to minimize the risk.''",

      "content": "COMPANY PLANS FUEL CELLS FOR THE HOME BY 2000 \n\n\n\n   LATHAN, N.Y. _ Plug Power LLC says it has developed a cleaner,\ncheaper and more reliable way of getting electricity into the\naverage home.\n\n\n   Plug Power announced it expects to bring a $3,000\ndishwasher-sized power source that can supply all the electricity\nneeded to run the average home by 2000.\n\n\n   Environmentalists and government energy-policy architects\nattending Wednesday's announcement agreed the fuel-cell technology\nis a good idea. They like the way fuel cells can produce\nelectricity in a clean, contained process that doesn't generate air\npollution the way coal-fired plants do, and that is also more\nefficient in generating power.\n\n\n   ``We are very interested in promoting this technology not only\nto consumers, but to municipalities around the state,'' said Daniel\nR. Mackay, representative of the New York Conservation Education\nFund.\n\n\n   The idea behind fuel-cell technology is to take a common fuel,\nsuch as natural gas or propane and convert that into hydrogen gas.\nEarly models are starting with hydrogen gas.\n\n\n   Hydrogen molecules are actually split into electrons and\nprotons, with the electrons providing the power that can be\nconverted into electricity for the home. The protons left over\nreact with oxygen in the air and create water, which is emitted\nfrom the fuel cell as exhaust. Thin membranes are used as a sort of\nstaging for the whole process.\n\n\n   ``It never stops to boggle my mind that a little Saran Wrap-type\nmaterial can give you 300 to 400 amps of power, and your average\ntoaster uses 15 amps of power,'' said William Ernst, vice president\nand technical director of the Latham, N.Y.-based Plug Power.\n\n\n   Fuel cells are manufactured to match the specific energy needs\nof different categories of consumers. Plug Power's first product\nwill produce 7,000 watts of power, more than enough to handle the\nenergy demands of a 2,000 square-foot home, according to the\ncompany.\n\n\n   Already, a modest brick-faced ranch belonging to a company\nemployee is using a demonstration model fuel cell now.\n\n\n   Company employees admitted visitors to the home Wednesday to\nshow how computers, televisions, kitchen appliances, lights and air\nconditioners can all be powered at the same time from the fuel\ncell.\n\n\n   Because the electricity is actually produced right on the home\nsite with a delivered fuel such as natural gas or propane from a\nhome tank, it doesn't have to be transmitted through power lines\nand poles that can be felled in storms.\n\n\n   Plug Power said the power produced by a fuel cell could be 20\npercent cheaper than that provided by major utility companies.\n\n\n   In addition, heat expended by the fuel cell can be used to heat\nwater in the home.\n\n\n   Plug Power President Gary Mittleman said he expected utility\ncompanies to distribute the systems to residential customers when\nthe first product, the Plug Power 7000, comes onto the market in\n2000.\n\n\n   Utility companies may own the product, install it on customer\npremises and charge for the electricity produced, he said. As the\nmarket evolves, customers might buy their own models, perhaps even\nfrom appliance dealers.\n\n\n   Other companies also are trying to produce this technology and\nto get into related markets. Some companies, for instance, are\nfocused solely on fuel cells for cars.\n\n\n   Connecticut-based Onsi Corp. produces fuel cells for commercial\nbuildings that require more power.\n\n\n   GE Power Systems distributes power-generation units for small\nindustrial units, and so goes after a different segment of the\npower market, according to a spokeswoman.\n\n\n   So far, Plug Power is well-positioned to be the leader in the\nU.S. residential market, said Jean M. Redfield, president of DTE\nEdison Electric, which is one of Plug Power's two corporate\nparents.\n\n\n   Plug Power also has its eye on markets in China, Latin America\nand other countries where some regions lack extensive power-grid\nsystems, executives said, as well as industrialized nations that\nare grappling with air-pollution problems.\n\n\n   Plug Power is a joint vent",

The goal: to find living microbes living\ndeep in the Earth.\n\n\n   Within moments the air becomes oppressively hot. This is one of\nthe farthest-reaching excavations in the world, burrowing more than\ntwo miles toward the center of Earth.\n\n\n   At the bottom of the mine, radioactivity and heat from the\nplanet's core raise the temperature of the stone in the tunnels to\na searing 120 F, and the atmospheric pressure is double that on the\nsurface.\n\n\n   Oxygen rarely exists naturally so far underground, and only a\nconstant rush of forced air from the surface disperses poisonous\nmethane and hydrogen seeping from the rock. Pumped-in jets of water\nhelp keep workers from slowly cooking to death.\n\n\n   Geologist T.C. Onstott, a Princeton professor, pulls a water\nbottle from his knapsack and takes a swig. To him, the heat and\nclaustrophobia are merely aggravation. Real worry for the team of\nscientists, as well as the miners, centers on ``seismic events'' _\nhigh-pressure cave-ins that kill.\n\n\n   It is difficult to obtain samples from wells that have not been\ncontaminated by air or water from the surface. Onstott decided he\nhad to find a way to visit the microbes himself. The mine he chose\nto explore is part of a sprawling manmade underworld started on a\nSunday morning in 1886 when an Australian prospector found a\ngold-rich outcrop on the present site of Johannesburg.\n\n\n   Like a nose peeping out of the covers, that outcrop was just the\nstart. Since then, three-quarters of the gold ever mined has come\nout of the region. The most recent shaft at East Driefontein took\n15 years to excavate _ and that was just the vertical hole.\n\n\n   For his journey into this biosphere, Onstott rounded up an\nall-star crew of microbiologists. They included: Bill Ghiorse, who\nled Environmental Protection Agency research into subsurface\nbacteria that eat toxic waste; Duane Moser, a lab wizard and avid\nspelunker; Svetlana Kotelnikova, a Russian scientist working in\nSweden; Mary DeFlaun of Envirogen, an environmental technology\nfirm; and Jim Fredrickson, who has isolated many deep-bacteria\ncultures while working at the Pacific Northwest National\nLaboratory.\n\n\n   At East Driefontein, Onstott and his team would spend three\nmonths gathering samples at a depth where no microbe hunters had\nventured before: The No. 5 Shaft bottoms out at 11,222 feet.\n\n\n   On this scouting mission, the elevator slowly comes to a halt at\n6,120 feet and the researchers walk through a short tunnel to a\nsecond elevator that takes them to the mine's deepest diggings. At\nthe bottom, the group boards a miniature train for a half-mile ride\nthrough the dark as a giant air pipe roars overhead.\n\n\n   The train stops at a dark hole in the wall: the stope, or mining\nface.

KENDALL, 72, DIES; HUNTED DOWN QUARK \n\n\n\n   Dr. Henry Way Kendall, one of three physicists who shared a\nNobel Prize for confirming that tiny particles called quarks were\nthe basic building blocks of matter, died on Monday while on an\nunderwater photography shoot in Wakulla Springs State Park, south\nof Tallahassee, Fla. He was 72 and lived in Sharon, Mass.\n\n\n   The local authorities reported that Kendall, an experienced\ndiver and underwater photographer, had joined a team from National\nGeographic magazine but was working by himself before his body was\nfound a few feet from shore. An autopsy was being performed.\n\n\n   Kendall was also known for his work with the Union of Concerned\nScientists, an advocacy group that he helped found in 1969 and led\nas chairman since 1973.\n\n\n   Kendall and his colleagues won the 1990 Nobel Prize in Physics\nfor experiments that confirmed the existence of quarks, the\ninfinitesimally tiny packets of energy that make up protons and\nneutrons, which were once thought to be matter's fundamental\nparticles. Dr. Richard E. Taylor, a Canadian professor at Stanford\nUniversity, and Dr. Jerome I. Friedman, a fellow scientist at the\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology, were recognized with\nKendall.\n\n\n   Their work from 1967 to 1973 validated what had been\nhypothesized independently in the early 1960s by Dr. Murray\nGel-Mann and Dr. George Zweig at the California Institute of\nTechnology. Gell-Mann named these elusive particles ``quarks'' on a\nwhim, borrowing the word from James Joyce's ``Finnegan's Wake.''\n\n\n   Kendall, Taylor and Friedman, who first met as graduate students\nat Stanford, conducted their research at the Stanford Linear\nAccelerator Center using a two-mile-long particle accelerator able\nto boost beams of electrons to an energy of 22 billion\nelectron-volts. They directed the beams at targets containing\nliquid hydrogen.\n\n\n   The purpose was to achieve a special kind of collision that\noccurs when electrons hit protons (which constitute the nuclei of\nhydrogen) at certain energies. Initial results were ambiguous. But\nas the three fine-tuned their instruments, the results clearly\nshowed that both protons and neutrons contained hard, electrically\ncharged, point-like particles corresponding to the quarks foretold\nin theory.\n\n\n   That confirmation allowed physicists to proceed confidently with\ndeveloping what is known as the standard model theory of matter.\nThe Nobel Prize panel applauded their feat as a ``breakthrough in\nour understanding of matter.''\n\n\n   In his role with the Union of Concerned Scientists, Kendall\nopposed President Ronald Reagan's ``Star Wars'' anti-missile\nproject, and he challenged the concept that such a system could\ndefend American cities from nuclear attack.\n\n\n   Kendall consistently warned of the dangers of nuclear weapons,\nspace-based arsenals and radiation leaks from nuclear power\ngenerators. His organization also studied the greenhouse effect, a\nwarming of the earth's climate as a result of emissions of\nheat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide. Kendall helped to brief\nPresident Clinton on the subject.\n\n\n   Kendall, who was born in Boston, graduated from Amherst College\nin 1950 and received a Ph.D. in nuclear physics from the\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology in 1955. He was a National\nScience Foundation Fellow at MIT at the time. He lectured at\nStanford before joining the MIT faculty in 1961, rose to full\nprofessor in 1967 and was named as the J.A. Stratton Professor of\nPhysics in 1991.\n\n\n   His research interests covered nucleon structure, high-energy\nelectron scattering, and meson and neutrino physics. He was a\nfellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science\nand the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the recipient of\nthe 1981 Leo Szilard Award of the American Physical Society and a\n1982 Bertrand Russell Society Award.\n\n\n   Kendall is survived by a brother, John, also of Sharon.",

Fuel cells convert hydrogen and oxygen\ninto electricity to power a vehicle.\n\n\nFuel cell energy generated from hydrogen is the easiest to\nproduce, eliminates all carbon dioxide emissions, and produces\ngreater efficiencies than gasoline, diesel or methanol,\nDaimlerChrysler said.\n\n\n\"Necar 4 is a major breakthrough in fuel cell because we've\ndeveloped a very powerful fuel cell system small enough to be\npackaged in a compact car,\" said Dr. Ferdinand Panik, head of\nDaimlerChrysler's fuel cell project.\n\n\n\"With Necar 4, we have already proven that fuel cell technology\nis viable,\" said Bob Eaton, chairman of DaimlerChrysler. \"Now, we\nare working to make the technology affordable for every consumer.\"\n\n\n\"Fuel cells have the potential to be the most attractive\nalternative propulsion system for the long term,\" said Juergen\nSchrempp, also chairman of DaimlerChrysler.\n\n\nDaimlerChrysler officials said the concept car would be\nreplaced with Necar X, which would run on methanol. Methanol\ncontains hydrogen and is the auto industry's favored fuel to power\nfuel cells.\n\n\nBut DaimlerChrysler engineers say there is still a lot of work\nto be done before next year, when they aim to develop a fleet of\ndemonstration cars based on the Necar X.\n\n\nFor example, the car is 1,100 pounds heavier than an equivalent\ngas-powered car because of the fuel-cell technology. Engineers say\nit must be 660 pounds lighter.\n\n\nThe fuel cells are also 10 times too expensive, engineers say.\nFor example, using current technology, a mass produced fuel cell\ncar would cost about 30,000 U.S. dollars just for the fuel cell\nhardware alone.\n\n\nOther companies -- including Ford Motor, General Motors and\nHonda -- also said they hope to market fuel cell vehicles by 2004.",

      "content": "SCIENCE NOTES AND NEWS \n\n\n\n   Bouncing Buckyball\n\n\n   To the list of remarkable properties of those single-molecule\nspheres of carbon atoms known as buckyballs can be added another:\nThey bounce.\n\n\n   Scientists at the University of California at Berkeley and the\nLawrence Berkeley National Laboratory have controlled the movement\nof a buckyball by making it the centerpiece of a tiny transistor.\n(Buckyballs consist of 60 carbon atoms and are more formally called\nbuckminsterfullerenes, in honor of the inventor of the geodesic\ndome, which has the same kind of structure.)\n\n\n   In a typical transistor, like those found by the millions on a\ncomputer chip, a voltage from a gate electrode controls the current\nthat flows between two other electrodes, known as the source and\ndrain, across a semiconducting material. In the Berkeley\ntransistor, a buckyball sits between the source and drain\nelectrodes, and the current flows one electron at a time.\n\n\n   Depending on the energy of the electron, it will either be\nreflected from the buckyball (thus, the transistor is ``off'') or\nit will hop across to the other electrode (the transistor is\n``on,'' allowing current to flow). And at certain energies, the\nresearchers report in Nature, when the electron hops across, it\nstarts the buckyball bouncing between the electrodes.\n\n\n   The researchers suggest that this coupling between the\nelectron's energy and the movement of the buckyball may have\neventual applications in very precise control of electron flow in\nmolecular-scale devices. In the meantime, bouncing buckyballs may\nbe a curiosity, but perhaps not a surprising one. After all, a\nbuckyball's structure of 12 pentagons and 20 hexagons is just like\nthat of a classic soccer ball.\n\n\n   Tiniest Fullerene\n\n\n   A sphere of 60 carbon atoms is not the smallest fullerene\npossible. That distinction belongs to one made up of 20 atoms\narranged in 12 pentagons, with no hexagons. (Those who paid\nattention in school know that this structure is called a\ndodecahedron.)\n\n\n   The problem with this fullerene was that no one had ever seen\nit. There were even doubts that it could exist, given the strain\ncaused by the high degree of curvature of such a sphere.\n\n\n   Those doubts have now disappeared, thanks to work by chemists in\nGermany and the United States, who report in Nature that they have\nproduced the smallest fullerene, although only in its gas phase and\nonly fleetingly.\n\n\n   The researchers made the molecule using dodecahedrane, which has\nthe right 20-carbon structure as its core but comes with hydrogen\natoms attached. By gently stripping off the hydrogen atoms in a\ntwo-step process, they were able to produce the fullerene.\n\n\n   El Nino's Child: Cholera\n\n\n   El Nino has been blamed for a many things, from destruction of\nmillion-dollar hillside homes in California to shrinking marine\niguanas on the Galapagos Islands.\n\n\n   Now, researchers from Cornell and the universities of Maryland,\nBarcelona and London have come up with a new reason to curse El\nNino: They have linked it to cholera outbreaks in Bangladesh.\n\n\n   Using mathematical models and data on cholera cases collected\nover 18 years at a hospital in Dhaka, Bangladesh, the researchers\nanalyzed the role of climate and previous levels of the disease on\noutbreak patterns. They found that cholera reached a peak every 3.7\nyears over the 18-year period, the same frequency as El Nino\nevents, in which warming waters in the eastern Pacific disrupt\nweather patterns worldwide.\n\n\n   Cholera is caused by a bacterium that thrives in plankton in\nbrackish water and in estuaries. The researchers, in a report in\nScience, suggest that warming of these waters caused by El\nNino-related atmospheric changes increases bacteria levels and the\nrisks of human contamination. They note there is an 11-month lag\nbetween an El Nino and a rise in cholera cases, which makes sense\ngiven that it takes time for the ocean warming in the eastern\nPacific to bring about climate changes in South Asia.",

The goal: to find living microbes living\ndeep in the Earth.\n\n\n   Within moments the air becomes oppressively hot. This is one of\nthe farthest-reaching excavations in the world, burrowing more than\ntwo miles toward the center of Earth.\n\n\n   At the bottom of the mine, radioactivity and heat from the\nplanet's core raise the temperature of the stone in the tunnels to\na searing 120 F, and the atmospheric pressure is double that on the\nsurface.\n\n\n   Oxygen rarely exists naturally so far underground, and only a\nconstant rush of forced air from the surface disperses poisonous\nmethane and hydrogen seeping from the rock. Pumped-in jets of water\nhelp keep workers from slowly cooking to death.\n\n\n   Geologist T.C. Onstott, a Princeton professor, pulls a water\nbottle from his knapsack and takes a swig. To him, the heat and\nclaustrophobia are merely aggravation. Real worry for the team of\nscientists, as well as the miners, centers on ``seismic events'' _\nhigh-pressure cave-ins that kill.\n\n\n   It is difficult to obtain samples from wells that have not been\ncontaminated by air or water from the surface. Onstott decided he\nhad to find a way to visit the microbes himself. The mine he chose\nto explore is part of a sprawling manmade underworld started on a\nSunday morning in 1886 when an Australian prospector found a\ngold-rich outcrop on the present site of Johannesburg.\n\n\n   Like a nose peeping out of the covers, that outcrop was just the\nstart.

      "content": "`JUST SIX NUMBERS': GETTING DOWN TO EARTH WITH THE ASTRONOMICAL \n\n\n\n   Famous cosmology books that offer to explain the universe to the\nastronomically inept like myself have always ended up disappointing\nme. Stephen Hawking's ``Brief History of Time'' may have been the\nleast understood best seller of all time. Steven Weinberg's ``First\nThree Minutes'' didn't sell as well as Hawking's book, but it\ncompeted with it in the difficult-to-wrap-your-mind-around\nsweepstakes. In light of that, I opened Martin Rees' ``Just Six\nNumbers: The Deep Forces That Shape the Universe,'' another\nastronomical overview for laymen, with some trepidation.\n\n\n   I needn't have. Rees' book is not easy; portions of it are even\nquite elusive. Still, it manages to be both a deep and an\naccessible book, and it answers a lot of the questions produced by\nnatural wonderment.\n\n\n   The main idea of ``Just Six Numbers'' is that the universe is\namazingly fine-tuned, and that if certain basic features were\nmathematically just a little bit different, we wouldn't be here,\nand neither would much else in the present universe. The force that\nholds the atomic nucleus together _ Rees' epsilon _ is one example,\nsince, if it were just a bit larger or just a bit smaller, there\nwould be no stars. Or, if the force of gravity were only slightly\ndifferent, the universe would never have come into existence. Rees,\nan English cosmologist who holds the title of astronomer royal at\nCambridge University, explains why these various numbers account\nfor the universe as it formed over the last 10 to 12 billion years\n_ and he gives us some sense of what will happen to it in the\nfuture (a prediction based on another of his six numbers).\n\n\n   Most compelling, Rees also shows the deep and powerful\nconnections between ourselves and everything else, the way our\nexistence and the nature of the universe are part of one consistent\npicture. Perhaps it is obvious to some that if the Andromeda Galaxy\nweren't there, neither would we be, but to me that revelation\nbrought a mystical, almost spiritual frisson. We are, Rees tells\nus, quite literally made of stardust. ``We cannot understand our\norigins without the cosmic context,'' he writes at the beginning of\nhis cosmological-mathematical-philosophical rumination. If you\napply yourself at something more than a casual level to his\nnontechnical, layman-friendly prose, you can pretty much understand\nwhat he means even when the concepts get, as it were, pretty\nstratospheric.\n\n\n   Rees answers basic questions like this: Why could we exist only\nin a very big universe? If the universe weren't something on the\norder of 10 billion light years across, life on earth would be\nimpossible. This is because it took some 4.5 billion years for\nhuman life to develop here on earth from the original single cell\norganisms, and it took just as long for the earliest stars to have\nproduced the materials that make up our life.\n\n\n   ``The very hugeness of our universe, which seems at first to\nsignify how unimportant we are in the cosmic scheme, is actually\nentailed by our existence!'' Rees exclaims. ``The expanse of space\nis not an extravagant superfluity; it's a consequence of the\nprolonged chain of events, extending back before our solar system\nformed, that preceded our arrival on the scene.''\n\n\n   Rees then gives a capsule history of cosmic formation, showing\nhow the original element, hydrogen, transmuted into all of the\nothers, up to the biggest, most complex naturally occurring one,\nuranium. ``Supernovae have created the `mix' of atoms that the\nearth is made of and that are the building blocks for the intricate\nchemistry of life,'' Rees writes. When they exploded, they showered\nthe universe with the debris that, eons later, ended up in the\ngaseous swirl that, eons after that, formed the sun and the planets\nof our solar system. This cosmic history explains why there is a\ngreat deal of carbon and iron in the world but very little gold. It\nis because the elements in their natural state exist in the same\nproportions as they were created during the eventful life cycles of",

      "content": "EARTH MAY HAVE LONG-LOST SISTERS \n\n\n\n   WASHINGTON _ Several Earth-like planets, created billions of\nyears ago during the formation of our solar system, may be\nwandering in deep space harboring conditions that could sustain\nsome form of life, according to a new theory proposed by a\nprominent planetary scientist.\n\n\n   These orphan worlds, ejected from the solar system by\ngravitational forces during its tumultuous beginnings, may have\nretained atmospheres rich in molecular hydrogen even as they were\nflung into the dark void of interstellar space, said Dr. David J.\nStevenson, a professor of planetary science at the California\nInstitute of Technology.\n\n\n   The rogue planets, instead of being cold, icy masses meandering\namong the stars as some astronomers have believed, could be warm\nbodies with dense, insulating atmospheres that trap enough volcanic\nheat to sustain water oceans and some types of simple life forms,\nhe said in an interview.\n\n\n   ``The idea of Earth-sized bodies being ejected when the solar\nsystem formed is not new,'' Stevenson said, ``But instead of being\nuninteresting frozen balls of barren matter, I am proposing that\nthey could have acquired a dense atmosphere and maintained it to\nact as an insulating blanket to sustain Earth-like temperatures in\nthe absence of sunlight.''\n\n\n   The idea that life could exist in such seemingly inhospitable\nconditions has been bolstered in recent years by the discovery of a\nvariety of unusual creatures living in lightless, sulfurous\nenvironments at the ocean floor, warmed by heat from undersea\nvents. These discoveries have fueled speculation that life might\nexist elsewhere in the universe, though possibly in forms that\nwould seem strange to ordinary humans.\n\n\n   Stevenson described his theories in the current issue of the\njournal Nature. Stevenson said that if planetary systems around\nother stars formed in similar ways, then there could be billions of\nsuch interstellar planets flung into space. If life can develop and\nbe sustained without sunlight on these planets, he wrote, ``it is\nconceivable that these are the most common sites of life in the\nuniverse.''\n\n\n   Stevenson said his idea of dark, life-sustaining planets moving\namong the stars is drawn from linking several accepted concepts of\nplanetary theory and his own calculations. ``This is just an idea,\nbut it comes together plausibly,'' he said.\n\n\n   Dr. Jack J. Lissauer, a specialist in planet formation at the\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration's Ames Research\nCenter in California, said Stevenson's idea is an ``interesting''\none that extends earlier work by numerous other scientists. ``David\nStevenson put all these parts together and has raised the\npossibility of something that is really far out, but not\nridiculous,'' he said, ``It makes some sense.''\n\n\n   Dr. Alan P. Boss, a solar system specialist at the Carnegie\nInstitution of Washington's Department of Terrestrial Magnetism,\nsaid the new theory ``is a logical extension of what people have\nproposed for a long time about the early solar system.''\n\n\n   When the solar system was formed about 4.5 billion years ago\nfrom primal gases and dust coming together, Boss said, the process\nproduced multiple cores that tried to become planets near the\norbits of Jupiter and Saturn. Some of these bodies became parts of\nthe giant planets when drawn in by their gravity, he said, while\nothers passed nearby and were flung away in a slingshot effect that\npropelled them out of the solar system.\n\n\n   This process was responsible for knocking about a trillion small\nbodies out of the infant solar system, causing them to form a giant\nsphere of debris in deep space that surrounds the sun and its\nplanets. This debris, called the Oort cloud, is believed to be the\nsource of most comets that enter the solar system.\n\n\n   ``If the Oort cloud was formed by many small bodies being\nknocked out of the solar system, it is not a great leap to imagine\nlosing a few Earth-sized bodies the same way,'' Boss said.\n\n\n   According to Stevenson, there were about a half-dozen Earth-like\nplanets in Jupite",

When aluminum reacts with water at high\ntemperatures, the aluminum oxidizes releasing energy and hydrogen\nin the process. This reaction releases four times as much energy as\nburning gunpowder.\n\n\n   The key to varying the speed of the bullet lies in the light\nweight of the propellant, making it suitable for handguns.\n\n\n   However, the reaction is difficult to get started, says\nTaleyarkhan. ''The aluminum forms a protective oxide layer, and\nit's tough to get rid of the barrier.'' Taleyarkhan has managed to\ndestabilize the oxide with an additive so the reaction can start.\nHe refuses to say what the additive is, because patents are\npending.\n\n\n   Because a charge made out of aluminum slurry is so light,\nTaleyarkhan has been able to put four separate charges into a\nshotgun cartridge. By controlling how many of the charges in the\ncartridge fire and at what time, Taleyarkhan's team can manipulate\na projectile's speed. They can even accelerate a bullet so gently\nthat it can be made out of very fragile materials.\n\n\n   ''We've shot little fluid slugs, bath balls with perfume, paint\nballs, Jello slugs _ everything I come across, I use,'' says\nTaleyarkhan.\n\n\n   Pocratsky says it should be possible to link a rangefinder to\nthe control mechanism, so that rubber bullets will automatically be\nfired with a reduced charge at close range. &QL;\n\n\n   &UR; (This article is excerpted from New Scientist, a weekly science\nand technology magazine based in London.) &LR;  &QC;",

      "content": "JUPITER'S STORY WEATHER IS LIKE EARTH'S, ONLY MORE SO \n\n\n\n   The weather on Jupiter seems always stormy. Lightning flashes\ndeep in the enveloping gas clouds. Eddies of atmospheric turbulence\nbob along the margins of jet streams, feeding energy into titanic,\nlong-lived whirlpools.\n\n\n   Thunderheads tower more than 30 miles above surrounding clouds,\nand new observations reveal that moist heat rising in these stormy\nupdrafts probably supplies the energy driving most Jovian weather.\n\n\n   Scientists analyzing photographs taken by the Galileo\nspacecraft, orbiting the largest planet in the solar system, have\nconcluded that this moist convection of thunderstorms on Jupiter is\nsimilar to that on Earth _ only more so _ but is generated by heat\nfrom a completely different source: from deep in the planet, not\nfrom sunlight.\n\n\n   Other scientists said the new findings, reported in the current\nissue of the journal Nature, appeared to solve the mystery of how\nJupiter gets the energy for such a constantly stormy weather\nsystem, although many questions remain unanswered.\n\n\n   A team of astronomers led by Dr. Peter J. Gierasch of Cornell\nUniversity found the most telling evidence in images, from visible\nand infrared light, of the south equatorial belt, a region west of\nJupiter's Great Red Spot, a seemingly permanent storm in the\nsouthern hemisphere.\n\n\n   Lightning was visible there before dawn. A few hours later, a\ncluster of huge Earthlike storms developed there. The scientists\nestimated that the vertical transport of heat by such storms\ncorresponded to the flux generated by the planet's internal heat\nsource.\n\n\n   ``We therefore conclude that moist convection is a dominant\nfactor in converting heat flow into kinetic energy in the Jovian\natmosphere,'' Gierasch's group wrote.\n\n\n   In another report, a group led by Dr. Andrew P. Ingersoll of the\nCalifornia Institute of Technology in Pasadena said the lightning\npreceding the storms was a critical clue indicating the presence of\nlarge amounts of water in the deep clouds. Nothing else, they\nnoted, could condense at depths of as much as 60 miles below the\nupper layer of the atmosphere.\n\n\n   ``So we can use lightning as a beacon that points to the place\nwhere there are rapidly falling raindrops and rapidly rising air\ncolumns _ a source of energy for the eddies,'' Ingersoll explained.\n``The eddies, in turn, get pulled apart by shear flow and give up\ntheir energy to these large-scale features. So ultimately, the\nGreat Red Spot gets its energy and stays alive by eating these\neddies.''\n\n\n   On Earth, violent storms like hurricanes and cyclones are fueled\nby the warm ocean. The water is heated by sunlight, which drives\nall terrestrial weather. But Jupiter is 5 times farther from the\nSun than is Earth and sunlight is only 4 percent as strong there as\non Earth, not enough to generate the observed tempests.\n\n\n   Scientists have long assumed that Jupiter's internal heat\nsomehow churns the thick atmosphere. Because of the heat reservoir\nof highly compressed hydrogen at its core, the planet generates\nnearly 70 percent more heat than it absorbs from the Sun. But how\ndid that heat rise from the depths to drive Jovian weather?\n\n\n   Moist convection had been proposed as the mechanism, said Dr.\nAlvin Seiff of the Ames Research Center in Mountain View, Calif.,\nbut there was no firm evidence until now.\n\n\n   In an accompanying journal article, Seiff said the new research\nrepresented ``a notable advance in our knowledge of Jupiter's\nweather by demonstrating that moist convection occurs and\ntransports significant amounts of energy.''\n\n\n   But he said, ``Much work remains for us to gain a broad\ndescription of Jupiter's fluid behavior.'' One remaining\nuncertainty is what circulation is like deeper below the outer\nlayers of the planet's thick clouds.",

Secrecy was so heavy there that his driver's\nlicense listed a number, not a name.\n\n\n   In an interview in 1975, Schreiber emphasized that he and other\nAmerican atom-bomb scientists had had few misgivings during World\nWar II about the destruction that their research would lead to.\n\n\n   ``It was a survival war,'' he said. ``If there was anything to\nbe done, we wanted to do it.''\n\n\n   By the summer of 1945, he was part of a group of Los Alamos\nscientists that has been called one of the greatest collections of\nscientific brainpower ever assembled in one place.\n\n\n   In July 1945, he and his co-workers completed the final assembly\nof the world's first atomic bomb, ``The Gadget.'' It was set off on\nJuly 16, 1945, atop a tower roughly 120 miles south of Albuquerque.\n\n\n   That explosion, at 5:29 a.m., raised the curtain on the nuclear\nera. It also created an enormous flash of light that made the\ndesert brighter than at noon.\n\n\n   ``You could almost see through your eyelids, it was so bright,''\nSchreiber recalled to an interviewer in 1980 during a 35th\nanniversary reunion at Los Alamos of 600 people who had helped\nconstruct the bomb. They met on the beautiful mesa where they had\nbuilt it.\n\n\n   Later he became part of the scientific team that was sent to\nTinian in the western Pacific to put together the two nuclear bombs\nthat were dropped on Japan. That island, which American forces had\nconquered in 1944, became the takeoff site for the aircraft that\ndropped the bomb called Little Boy on Hiroshima on Aug. 6, 1945,\nand the bomb called Fat Man on Nagasaki on Aug. 9, 1995.\n\n\n   ``He really was the key person involved for the assembly of the\nNagasaki bomb,'' Jim Danneskiold, a Los Alamos National Laboratory\nspokesman, said.\n\n\n   Afterward, Schreiber said that his work on Tinian had helped\nsave the lives of American troops by making an invasion of Japan\nunnecessary.\n\n\n   After World War II, he decided to continue working at Los Alamos\nbecause, he said in the 1975 interview, of the ``heady atmosphere''\nthere, and because he could not see himself tied to the routine of\ncollege teaching.\n\n\n   In the book ``Dark Sun: The Making of the Hydrogen Bomb'' by\nRichard Rhodes, (Simon &AMP; Schuster, 1995) Schreiber is quoted with\nhis recollections of the period after the atomic bombs were\ndropped: ``That was the time one realized that it would be\nimpossible to simply say, those are fine gadgets, they ended the\nwar and now let's just lock everything up and forget about it.\nReally one had to live with this situation from here on.''\n\n\n   In the war's aftermath, he was named a group leader in the\nweapons division of what is now Los Alamos National Laboratory. In\n1946, he was observing some sensitive assembly work by a colleague,\nLouis Slotin, when they and others were accidentally exposed to\nradiation. Slotin died, but Schreiber and several others survived.\n\n\n   In 1951, Schreiber was named the leader of the laboratory's\nweapons division, which went on to do important work on the\ndevelopment of the first hydrogen bomb.\n\n\n   In 1951, a timetable was set for those who were, as Rhodes put\nit in his book, ``to design and deliver a first experimental\nH-bomb'' for a test in November 1952. He wrote, ``it was clear from\nthe beginning that the test device would be lar",

Cosmetic specialists say it's good\nfor the skin, and that hydrogen peroxide cream helps water and\noxygen penetrate the skin better. But not everyone agrees.\n\n\n   ``There's no scientific evidence to support the belief that\noxygen facials do anything for the skin,'' says Dr. Mitchel Goldman\nof Dermatology Associates in San Diego. ``Oxygen is actually toxic\nto skin cells. That's why most cosmetics contain antioxidants,\nincluding vitamins C, A and E.''\n\n\n   Oxygen reacts easily with other substances and causes metals to\nrust. Hemoglobin in the blood contains iron that oxidizes or\n``rusts'' in order to combine with oxygen in the lungs and carry it\nto all the body's cells. There, oxygen oxidizes food to yield\nenergy.\n\n\n   But oxidation of the body's own cells speeds aging. It's also\nlinked to heart disease and cancer.\n\n\n   That's why antioxidants, like vitamins C, A and E, found\nabundantly in fruits and vegetables, have become so popular. They\ndestroy harmful molecules called free radicals that are produced by\noxidation. Free radicals disrupt the DNA inside cells and advance\naging.\n\n\n   ``The skin does better in a nonoxygen environment,'' says\nGoldman. ``That's one of the reasons why I advise my patients to\nuse antioxidant creams for their skin.''\n\n\n   Cosmeticians have a different take on the role that oxygen plays\nin skin care.\n\n\n   ``When the oxygen gets into the skin, the cell regeneration\nspeeds up,'' says Joyce Carboni, whose Skinsational Spa in\nCarlsbad, Calif., specializes in oxygen facials. ``We apply\nhydrogen peroxide cream to the face to help oxygen penetrate the\nskin and get into the cells.''\n\n\n   ``The relaxation that you get when you spend time giving\nyourself a facial is absolutely incredible,'' says Bucalo. ``It's\nabout what's next, and what's new. I'm available and willing to try\nanything these ladies have in mind for me.''\n\n\n   ``Oxygen is extremely hydrating and healing to the skin. We've\nseen the results,'' adds Carboni.\n\n\n   The oxygen facial begins with cleansing. The client receives a\nmild facial scrub with jojoba beads or an enzyme peel. A thin film\nof 2 percent hydrogen peroxide cream is then applied. A plastic\nwrap or facial steamer may be used for the next 10 minutes. Then a\nmask containing hydrogen peroxide is placed over the skin for\nanother 15 to 20 minutes.\n\n\n   To complete the facial, a hydrogen peroxide finishing cream is\ngently massaged into the skin.\n\n\n   ``The best thing about a facial is the therapeutic message,''\nsays Goldman. ``It can perhaps promote lymphatic drainage.''\n\n\n   Cosmeticians say the skin absorbs oxygen like a sponge, but\nmedical opinion says otherwise.\n\n\n   ``There's a limit to how much oxygen your body can absorb,''\nsays Dr. John C. Nelson, of the American Medical Association. ``The\noxygen carrying capacity of the blood cannot be increased, except\nby increasing the number of red cells.''\n\n\n   Red cells contain hemoglobin molecules that bind oxygen in the\nlungs and deliver it to the body's cells as needed. Nelson says\nonly people suffering from heart or respiratory diseases benefit\nfrom extra oxygen. Regarding oxygen facials or oxygen-infused\nbeverages he says, ``To the extent that these are used as social or\nentertainment types of activities, I think there's no detriment.''\n\n\n   Surgery patients commonly receive 30 percent oxygen during and\nafter surgery (air is only 21 percent oxygen) because the lungs\ndon't work as well under anesthesia.

Other \nautomakers are working on similar fuel-efficient hybrid cars or \nhave produced working models. \n\n\n\tThe P2000 has the passenger room, trunk space and acceleration  \nof a Taurus, with 40 percent less weight. The car is made mostly of \naluminum and other lightweight materials, and weights about 2,000 \npounds, Ford engineers said. \n\n\n\tFord has not said it would put the car into production in the  \nfuture. Domestic automakers are struggling with the cost of such a \nvehicle and have kept their research costs confidential. For \ninstance, aluminum is three to five times as expensive to use as \nsteel, pound for pound. \n\n\n\t``This is not some sort of high-expense low-volume small vehicle  \nwe're working on. We want to hit the mainstream of the market with \na family sedan. That's a little bit of a tougher order,'' said Mike \nTamor, Ford's project leader of hybrid electric vehicle design. \n\n\n\tThe engine has an important advantage over the hydrogen fuel  \ncell future cars some other automakers are designing: It can be \nrefueled at a gas station that also sells diesel fuel. \n\n\n\t``What's significant is that we have a full-size family sedan  \nthat gets double the mileage of today's typical automobile and is a \npractical car for today's needs,'' said Dan Reicher, the Energy \nDepartment's assistant secretary of the office of energy efficiency \nand renewable energy. \n\n\n\tToyota already has a hybrid gas-electric vehicle on the road in  \nJapan, called the Prius. The four-seat compact car gets 66 mpg, and \nToyota expects to introduce it into the U.S. market next year. \n\n\n\tAlthough Energy Department officials are excited about other  \nhigh-mileage hybrids, they say the P2000 is different because it \naims for the mass market with a full-size car that seats five \npeople. \n\n\n\t``All the knowledge we have developed in this hybrid program is  \ndefinitely going very heavily toward supporting product \ndevelopment'' for the mass market, Tamor said. \n\n\n\tFord and General Motors Corp. have said they do not plan to have  \na hybrid car in production until the next century. One hurdle left \nis making sure a mass-marketed, fuel-efficient family car is about \nas affordable as today's cars. \n\n\n\t``In order to be out there in large numbers, it has to be at a  \nprice that the customers are willing to pay,'' Tamor said. \n\n\n\tFord is delivering the car under the Hybrid Propulsion Systems  \nDevelopment Program, a joint program with the Energy Department \nthat domestic automakers undertook to double the fuel economy of a \nmidsize sedan in city driving -- or to around 50 mpg, department \nofficials said. \n\n\n\tThe department since has set its sights on a more ambitious goal  \nof a family car that gets 80 mpg. But Reicher calls the 60 mpg car \n``a major step'' toward that goal, demonstrating practical \ntechnologies that can be used in mainstream cars in the coming \nyears. \n\n\n\tDaimlerChrysler AG is expected to have a hybrid car ready for  \nthe Energy Department to look at in December, Energy officials \nsaid. \n\n\n\tThe Ford hybrid power system involves a small diesel engine that  \ndoes most of the low-speed driving while an electric battery is \nused to help with climbing hills and sudden acceleration. The \nbattery also recaptures about half of the energy used in braking. \n\n\n\tTo conserve even more power, the engine turns off while the car  \nis idling at traffic lights. When a dri",

It's fusing.\n\n\n   Burning is a chemical reaction that involves the electrons in\nthe outer shells of atoms in the fuel. Oxygen is part of what's\nnecessary for the chemical reaction. But the sun and other stars\ncreate their energy by fusing the nuclei at the center of hydrogen\natoms.

      "content": "MYSTERIOUS PROCESS BREAKS DOWN WATER MOLECULES  \n (FOR RELEASE THE WEEK OF MON., NOV. 16, 1998)\n\n\n\n   The words ``mysterious'' and ``bizarre'' don't often come up in\nconversations among chemists. But that's how they are describing a\nway to split water into hydrogen and oxygen at room temperature\nusing a simple catalyst. Japanese researchers now say that the\nenergy needed to break the bonds that hold water molecules together\nseems to come from stirring the liquid.\n\n\n   When Kazunari Domen and his colleagues at Tokyo Institute of\nTechnology first reported last February that a powdered cuprous\noxide catalyst could split water at room temperature, chemists sat\nup and took notice This reaction usually takes place at 3000\ndegrees C and is driven by light. If its efficiency could be\nimproved, hydrogen would become much more attractive as a cheap,\nclean fuel.\n\n\n   Domen initially thought that the energy driving the\nlow-temperature reaction came from light_a mechanism chemists could\njust about live with. But now he reports that the reaction\ncontinues in the dark for hundreds of hours. The quicker the\ncontainer is stirred, says Domen, the more hydrogen and oxygen are\nproduced.\n\n\n   Domen believes that the mechanical energy is converted to\nchemical energy without first being converted to thermal energy.\n``This is the first example of mechanical energy being converted\ninto chemical energy by catalysis,'' he says. But Domen cannot\nexplain how this works.\n\n\n   To most chemists, the idea is heresy. And the prospect of\nproducing a source of fuel by a mechanism no one understands evokes\nmemories of the ``cold fusion'' saga of 1989. But Domen's results\nwere carefully reviewed before they were published. He has also\navoided making any bold claims about practical applications.\n\n\n   ``A lot of colleagues were incredulous, but I think Domen is a\nvery serious scientist,'' says Michael Gratzel of the Swiss Federal\nInstitute of Technology in Lausanne.\n\n\n   Gratzel suspects that something more mundane is occurring,\nhowever, such as friction between the catalyst and the glass\ncontainer causing a buildup of electrical charge. The resulting\ntiny sparks could break down small amounts of water. ``There's an\neasy way to rule that out,'' he says. Dissolving a salt in the\nwater would change its conductivity and the amount of gases\nproduced.\n\n\n   Arthur Nozik, a chemist at the National Renewable Energy\nLaboratory in Golden, Colorado, doubts if the effect is really\ncaused by catalysis. ``I wouldn't be surprised if they are actually\nusing up some of the metal oxide,'' he says. Nozik suspects that\nthe cuprous oxide might react with water, liberating hydrogen. The\noxygen could come from small quantities of the gas dissolved in the\nwater.\n\n\n   Domen says that less than 5 percent of the energy from stirring\nappears to end up splitting water, producing a small amount of\nhydrogen and oxygen gas. But he thinks he can improve the yield by\nlearning more about how the reaction works. ``If we can increase\nthe efficiency by an order of magnitude, then it may be possible to\nthink about practical applications,'' he says.\n\n\n   ``It sounds odd, but maybe it only sounds odd because it's\nnew,'' says Sean McGrady of King's College, London. He likens the\nsituation to the discovery in the 1980s that sound can drive\nchemical reactions, which has led to the burgeoning field of\nsonochemistry. ``When these things show up they always challenge\npeople's conceptions of how energy can get into a chemical\nreaction,'' says McGrady. ``These reports take time to confirm or\nshoot down.''  &QL;\n\n\n   &UR; (This article is excerpted from New Scientist, a weekly science\nand technology magazine based in London.) &LR;  &QC;",

      "content": "Researchers find new evidence of water on the moon\n\n\n\t   WASHINGTON (AP) _ As much as 10 billion metric tons of water may\nbe frozen in soil near the moon's poles, according to new data from\na spacecraft orbiting the moon.\n\t   If that much water is there _ more than 10 times previous\nestimates _ it might one day be enough to build a moon village or\nto fuel rocket ships cruising even deeper into space, experts say.\n\t   ``Our data is very clear _ there is an abundance of hydrogen at\nboth lunar poles, and we interpret that to mean there is water\nthere,'' said Alan Binder, chief scientist for the Lunar Prospector\nspacecraft now orbiting the moon. ``There is at least one billion\ntons of water, but there could be as much as 10 billion tons.''\n\t   That, said Binder, is enough to build a colony on the moon's\nsurface and to operate a rocket service station for journeys\nbeyond.\n\t   ``We knew from the Apollo missions that we could go to the moon\nand build a base there, but we would have to take our water and\nfuel with us,'' Binder said.\n\t   The deposits of water or hydrogen, he said, are ``an enabling\nresource. You could build a colony without it, but this really\nmakes it a lot simpler.''\n\t   In addition to sustaining life in such a colony, water also can\nbe used for rocket fuel by breaking it into its constituent\nchemicals _ hydrogen and oxygen. Propellant for the main engines on\nthe space shuttle, for instance, is hydrogen and oxygen.\n\t   Paul Spudis, a researcher at the Lunar and Planetary Institute\nin Houston, called the discovery significant.\n\t   ``We've debated for 30 years whether or not there is ice on the\nmoon, and now this shows there is,'' Spudis said.\n\t   Spudis was on the science team of an earlier lunar mission _ the\nClementine spacecraft _ that found radar indications of water on\nthe lunar south pole. Now, he said, two different research methods\nhave confirmed the presence of lunar water.\n\t   ``This makes colonizing the moon a lot more attractive,'' said\nEd Weiler, a space scientist at NASA. ``I think before we colonize\nto Mars we need to colonize the moon for practice, so from that\nperspective this is a major discovery.''\n\t   Binder, head of the U.S. Lunar Research Institute, and\nresearchers from the Los Alamos National Laboratory, both in\nCalifornia, report their findings from the Lunar Prospector\nspacecraft Friday in the U.S. journal Science.\n\t   Lunar Prospector was launched in January and has spent months\norbiting the moon, gathering signals with four instruments.\n\t   The craft found water or hydrogen deposits with a device that\nmeasures the energy, or speed, of neutrons. Neutrons form when\nradiation from the sun strikes the moon's surface. They bounce\naround in the soil, then out into space. The energy or speed of the\nneutrons is affected by the chemistry of the soil.\n\t   By measuring the ratio of intermediate-speed neutrons to the\nfast and slow neutrons, the researchers were able to determine that\nhydrogen is present in the lunar soil, Binder said.\n\t   Ice is signaled at both poles, but about 50 percent more appears\nto be around the north pole, the researchers said.\n\t   Binder and other researchers said the most logical form for that\nhydrogen to take is as a constituent of water. And since the moon\nis so cold, the water is certain to be frozen solid.\n\t   All the deposits are in patches within craters that never see\nsunlight. Temperatures there are constantly about minus-250 degrees\nF (minus-156C), said Binder. This keeps the ice in place\n``virtually forever,'' he said. The data suggest the ice is in\nlayers, covered with up to 18 inches of soil.\n\t   Even more ice could be in layers below two feet of soil, said\nBinder.\n\t   Harvesting the ice would involve digging it up and thawing it,\nusing solar reflectors. A chemical process then could separate\nhydrogen and oxygen.\n\t   ``The only trick would be to build equipment that could work in\nthose extremely cold temperatures,'' said Binder.\n\t   Comets smashing into the moon over millions of years probably\ndeposited the water, Binder and Spudis said.\n\t   An impacting c",

      "content": "(ATTN: N.H., N.J., N.Y.)  \n FUEL CELLS MOVE SLOWLY BUT SURELY TOWARD BECOMING BIG BUSINESS \n\n\n\n   CARLSBAD, Calif. _ Jeff Colborn plunged into fusion energy\nresearch in the late 1980s, first at the Lawrence Livermore\nNational Laboratory and then at the Massachusetts Institute of\nTechnology, filled with idealism about fusion's potential for\nrevolutionizing nuclear power generation.\n\n\n   ``I wanted the toughest challenge,'' said Colborn, recalling the\ngoals he had after studying engineering and physics at the\nUniversity of California at Berkeley.\n\n\n   But the entrepreneurial Colborn, who founded a business during\nhigh school selling decals for the motorcycles he and his friends\nraced, fretted that it could take 50 years before anyone could\nbuild a business on fusion. No wonder he is more at home these days\nas founder and chief executive of Metallic Power Inc., a\nlittle-known entrant in the intense race to design and manufacture\nfuel cells, low-pollution devices that generate electrical current\nfrom chemical reactions.\n\n\n   Although they are similar in many ways to batteries, fuel cells\ncan be quickly regenerated by pumping in new chemical fuel. And\nunlike fusion, they are teetering on the edge of becoming big\nbusiness. Several hundred units have been sold already, and some\nanalysts predict a billion-dollar market by 2005.\n\n\n   The last steps are not coming easily, though. No one is making\nmoney yet, and the technology is not ready for potential home-run\nmarkets, like power for vehicles.\n\n\n   The fuel cell companies' slow path highlights the difficulties\nof innovating for the nuts-and-bolts dimension of the economy.\nThough this is not the fusion world it is also not the Internet\nworld, where new services can be up and running within weeks and\nbarriers to entry are low.\n\n\n   ``People have gotten used to the pace of change of information\ntechnology,'' said Vincent R. Shiely, a vice president who oversees\nnew ventures _ including a research partnership with Metallic Power\n_ at Briggs &AMP; Stratton Corp., the largest manufacturer of\nnonautomotive gasoline engines. ``But this is pushing the frontier\nof materials, and there are still basic technology and reliability\nquestions.''\n\n\n   Fuel cell companies are developing everything from replacements\nfor tiny batteries like those used in cell phones and hearing aids\nto highly efficient power plants big enough to fit the needs of\nelectric utility companies.\n\n\n   The challenge is to come up with answers to conflicting demands\nfor, among other things, lightness, reliability, durability and low\ncost.\n\n\n   Metallic Power has been slowed down by annoyingly mundane\nproblems like making its early designs leak-proof. But there have\nalso been scarier roadblocks, as when Colborn and Stuart I.\nSmedley, his chief technology officer, reached the painful\nconclusion that a system they had adapted from other researchers\nfor converting wastes back into recyclable fuel was hopelessly\nunreliable.\n\n\n   Smedley, a former university professor from New Zealand,\neventually came up with a new design that was much simpler,\none-tenth the size, and, perhaps best of all, something that\nMetallic Power's lawyer believes is patentable. But it took many\nmonths.\n\n\n   ``Multiplying the ideal time for each stage by two has turned\nout to be a pretty accurate predictor of what actually happens,''\nColborn said. ``Our schedule has stretched.''\n\n\n   Metallic Power was founded in 1995 but did not produce its\nfirst, primitive prototype until late 1997. The company faces steep\nchallenges. Not only is it a relative newcomer with far less\ncapital than many others; it is also using zinc as its fuel, a\nradically different approach.\n\n\n   Several venture capitalists unfamiliar with the energy business\ngot cold feet after looking closely at Colborn's plans. Among them\nwas a restaurant owner. ``I spent a lot of time driving to L.A. and\neating in his restaurant,'' Colborn said, but the prospect dropped\nout when it came time to sign a check. ``Everybody thinks fuel\ncells are cool, but when they get into it they discover they know\nnot",

The only byproduct, officials say, is hot\nwater.\n\n\n   The new fuel-cell system, the first for a sewage plant in North\nAmerica, has proved to be effective after a year of operation,\nofficials from the New York Power Authority said. The system\ngenerates 200 kilowatts of electricity, enough to supply 60 typical\nhomes, the officials said.\n\n\n   In the process, more than 20 tons of gas that would otherwise\nhave simply been burned off in the open air or wafted away was\nturned into electricity last year, said Shalom Zelingher, the\ndirector of research for the Power Authority. The hot water\ngenerated was used to warm bacteria that help break down the\nsewage. ``This is not just a concept anymore,'' he said.\n\n\n   Fuel cells run on hydrogen, which is contained in standard\nfossil fuels like natural gas and gasoline, and also in methane.\nThey produce no significant pollution because they use a chemical\nreaction to harvest energy from the fuel without burning it,\nZelingher said.\n\n\n   The same process supplies electricity on the space shuttle and\nis finding more uses each year on Earth, with fuel cells powering\nvehicles, factories and, in a few weeks, the New York Police\nDepartment precinct house in Central Park. Two fuel cells will turn\nnatural gas into electricity at the office tower at 4 Times Square.\nOthers are going to be installed in some city hospitals to provide\nuninterrupted power during blackouts, Power Authority officials\nsaid.\n\n\n   But some of the biggest benefits come at a sewage plant,\nofficials said, where the system uses waste methane, which is\nabundant and free, instead of natural gas or some other fuel that\nmust be bought. The systems can also be run with gas from\nlandfills.\n\n\n   New York City environmental officials recently inspected the\nYonkers system and said they hoped to install fuel cells at some of\nthe city's 14 sewage plants, in hopes of recycling some of the 1.6\nbillion cubic feet of gas generated every year. Most of that gas is\nnow burned off in flares at the plants.\n\n\n   Joel A. Miele Sr., the city's Commissioner of Environmental\nProtection, said the device would be particularly welcome at plants\nthat have been plagued with odor problems from the excess gas.\n``Sometimes our plants can be very, very unwelcome neighbors,''\nMiele said.\n\n\n   When engineers from the Power Authority presented their results\nwith the fuel cell, he recalled, ``It sounded like Santa Claus had\ncome early.''\n\n\n   Fuel cells have been around for decades, but because of their\nhigh price and complicated technology they have been relegated\nuntil recently to exotic applications like the space program.\n\n\n   Within the devices, a chemical process causes hydrogen from the\nfuel and oxygen from the air to combine, making water and releasing\nelectrons. The electrons flow across plates like those in a car\nbattery and generate electricity.\n\n\n   The Power Authority supplies electricity to public agencies,\npowering everything from sewage plants and the New York City\nsubways to hospitals, schools and public housing. It has been\ndeveloping alternative power sources to cut the need to build\ncostly new power plants in the region, said Stephen Schoenholz, a\nspokesman.\n\n\n   The fuel cell in Yonkers is a standard commercial 200-kilowatt\nunit made by the ONSI Corporation of New Windsor, Conn., which also\nmakes the fuel cells for the space shuttle. But the Power\nAuthority, together with federal environmental scientists, devised\nan additional filter that first removes impurities from the waste\ngas, like sulfur and nitrogen, that could damage the device.\n\n\n   The system costs $1.3 million, but that price should drop as the\ntechnology becomes more established, company officials said.\n\n\n   The fuel cell test in Yonkers was part",

Partners include auto manufacturers DaimlerChrysler\nand Ford, oil companies ARCO, Shell and Texaco, and fuel cell\ncompany Ballard Power Systems.\n\n\nThe partnership will place about 50 fuel cell vehicles -- cars\nand buses -- on the road between 2000 and 2003.\n\n\nFuel cells create their own electricity through a chemical\nreaction between hydrogen and oxygen. Fuel cell vehicles have the\npotential to compete with conventional cars in passenger space,\nperformance, driving range, safety and cost. In addition they will\nprovide good fuel efficiency and lower noise, vibration and air\nemissions than vehicles powered by internal combustion engines.\nThis combination makes fuel cell the most likely alternative\ntechnology to power the vehicles of the next century, according to\nCalifornia Air Resources Board.\n\n\nIn addition to testing the vehicles, the partnership will also\nidentify fuel infrastructure issues and prepare the California\nmarket for this new technology. Initial demonstration vehicles\nwill run on hydrogen, directly from tanks on board the vehicles.\nSubsequent demonstration vehicles are likely to run on methanol\nfuel. Technology for other liquid fuels such as cleaner form of\ngasoline will be evaluated. A key goal of the partnership is to\ndetermine the best fuel infrastructure for the market entry of\nfuel cell vehicles, which could emerge as soon as 2004.",

      "content": "MOBILE FOAM  \n (FOR RELEASE THE WEEK OF JULY 17, 2000)\n\n\n\n   For years, polystyrene foam has been keeping our coffee hot and\nour beer cold. Now chemists have taught single molecules of this\nplastic a more impressive trick _ how to snatch and store energy\nfrom light in the way that plants do.\n\n\n   The researchers, based as the Los Alamos National Laboratory in\nNew Mexico, are aiming to build a new breed of cheap\npolystyrene-based batteries. They say the batteries could be used\nto provide power for anything from cars to cellphones.\n\n\n   The project is part of continuing efforts by Tom Meyer and his\ncolleagues at Los Alamos to find simple materials that can mimic\nthe complex chemistry of photosynthesis, which allows plants to\nstore energy from sunlight in chemical bonds.\n\n\n   The first step in photosynthesis is the absorption of a photon-a\nparticle of light-by an antenna composed of the green pigment\nchlorophyll. This energy is then used to propel electrons around\nthe chemical bonds of the molecules involved in the reaction,\nultimately stripping electrons from water to make oxygen, and\nadding them to carbon dioxide to create energy-rich sugars.\n\n\n   Meyer's team had already managed to recreate each of these steps\nseparately, using different synthetic molecules that work in\nconjunction with an atom of the metal ruthenium. In his latest\nexperiments, he decided to link these molecules on a polymer\nbackbone.\n\n\n   ``Because polystyrene polymers are so widely used, their\nchemistry is very well understood,'' he says. ``So it was an\nobvious choice for the backbone.''\n\n\n   To test out the new molecule, the researchers zapped a solution\nof it with a laser. As they had hoped, some side chains containing\nthe ruthenium antennas were able to absorb the light energy and\npass it along the polymer chain. When the energy reached another\ntype of ruthenium complex, it was able to do some chemical work,\npushing an electron to a different part of the complex. Mobilizing\nelectrons in this way is what batteries do-supplying electrons from\nan anode that can be drawn around a circuit and back towards its\ncathode.\n\n\n   Michael Wasielewski, a photosynthetic chemist at Northwestern\nUniversity in Chicago, thinks Meyer's choice of polymer was the\nkey.\n\n\n   ``All the right properties are there,'' he says. ``And we\nalready have robust manufacturing technology to work with\npolystyrene. It's a nice piece of work.''\n\n\n   Because polystyrene derivatives are inexpensive to create, Meyer\nthinks his polymer holds great promise for a wide array of devices\n_ such as solar-powered fuel cells that pull electrons from water\nto create hydrogen fuel or to generate an electric current.\n\n\n   For now, his team's main aim is to increase the efficiency with\nwhich the molecules convert energy, which is now hovering around 15\npercent.\n\n\n   ``There's a lot of hard work ahead, but you have to expect\nthat,'' he says. ``After all, it took natural photosynthesis more\nthan a billion years to evolve.'' &QL; \n &UR; (This article is excerpted from New Scientist, a weekly science and\ntechnology magazine based in London.) &LR;  &QC;",

      "content": "BRITISH NUCLEAR CONCERN'S MISSTEPS AT HOME RAISE CONCERNS IN U.S. \n\n\n\n   WASHINGTON _ From simmering tanks of high-level nuclear waste in\nWashington State and plutonium laced with chemical poisons in Idaho\nto production of radioactive gases in South Carolina, the federal\ngovernment's nuclear weapons program has festering technical and\nenvironmental problems like no one else in the country.\n\n\n   With no easy way to solve them, the Energy Department has gone\nto one of the few entities in the world with experience as broad as\nits own: British Nuclear Fuels, part of the nuclear power and\nweapons agency of the British government, now spun off as a\ngovernment-owned company.\n\n\n   But as the British company now known as BNFL prepares to tackle\nthe American problems, an embarrassing lapse has surfaced back home\nin its core business, which is producing plutonium fuel. British\ngovernment inspectors reported in February that for months,\nemployees who were supposed to be performing a final measurement of\nfuel pellets bound for Japanese reactors were instead copying\nnumbers from previous shipments. BNFL executives said workers felt\nthe work was boring and a crew on the night shift had apparently\nfound it easier to falsify the numbers.\n\n\n   Concern over the company's business practices is now affecting\nthe company's contracts with the U.S. government. Energy Secretary\nBill Richardson, in a telephone interview from Algeria, where he is\nmeeting OPEC ministers, said he had ordered his department to send\na team to England to meet with British investigators. ``We are now\nplacing BNFL under extra scrutiny because of these problems,'' he\nsaid. ``I have been uneasy about some of their operations in the\nU.S. If we uncover anything, I will take swift and strong action.''\n\n\n   He added, ``Business as usual is over with BNFL and with all our\ncontractors, but especially with BNFL.'' The situation, Richardson\nsaid, was ``itching for stronger management review.''\n\n\n   The company said the incident with the pellets was an isolated\nproblem. ``We feel very badly about the pellets,'' said David R.\nBonser, a director of the government-owned company, and head of\nwaste management and decommissioning. He said it was a problem\ncaused by ``a handful of people in one of the plants who did things\nthey absolutely should not have done.''\n\n\n   Britain's nuclear installations inspectorate, however, rejected\nthat defense. ``Although various individuals were at fault, a\nsystematic failure allowed it to happen,'' the report, published in\nFebruary, said. ``In a plant with the proper safety culture, the\nevents described in this report could not have happened.''\n\n\n   John J. Taylor, the company's chief executive, has resigned, but\nthe company's problems continue. Sellafield, the plant on the west\ncoast of England where the fuel was made, was never popular with\nneighbors: for years it has dumped radioactive waste into the Irish\nSea; English anti-nuclear advocates and the Irish government would\nlike it shut, and the British government reported that pigeons in\nthe area had become radioactive from the plant's emissions. But now\nthe problem is not just with neighbors, but with customers.\n\n\n   Japan asked the British company to take back the fuel, although\nthe company insists that two automatic systems measured the pellets\nand found their diameter to be within specifications. A German\nutility, PreussenElektra AG, shut a reactor running on the fuel\nthat was not properly measured, and asked for compensation; Germany\nalso suspended imports of additional fuel.\n\n\n   Well before its fuel problem at Sellafield, however, it was\nclear to leaders of the British company that the future\nprofitability of that business was uncertain. As a result, they\nmoved decisively into the United States. With an American partner,\nthe Morrison Knudson Corp., the company acquired many assets of the\nold Westinghouse Corp., which had been a major Energy Department\ncontractor; it also bid directly on Energy Department work at Oak\nRidge, Tenn., and Hanford, in Washington State. And it has hired\nseveral form",

      "content": "CHEMICAL EXPERIMENT SUPPORTS MAVERICK THEORY ON ORIGINS OF LIFE \n\n\n\n   A maverick theory about the origin of life has received striking\nsupport from an experiment that mimicked the violent interactions\nof deep seated rock and common gases during the Hadean epoch, the\ndays when the earth had just formed as a planet.\n\n\n   Researchers found to their surprise that even in these hellish\nconditions they created a chemical known as pyruvate, which is\ncrucial for the metabolism of living cells.\n\n\n   Pyruvate is the fuel for a universal energy-producing process\nknown as the citric acid cycle.\n\n\n   The work, by George D. Cody and his colleagues at the Carnegie\nInstitution of Washington's Geophysical Laboratory, is being\nreported Friday in the journal Science.\n\n\n   The new finding does not explain how or where life began but it\nsupports a theory that proposes a new way of looking at this long\nintractable problem. The theory, proposed by a German patent\nattorney, Guenther Waechtershaeuser of Munich, holds that the\norigin of life should be sought by looking for a metabolism, some\nrepeated cycle of chemical change, that may have taken place on the\nearly earth and that may then have built itself up into more\ncomplex molecules and organisms.\n\n\n   This contrasts with the conventional approach, which is to take\nfamiliar parts of today's cells, like nucleic acids, and try to\nfigure out the conditions in which they may have formed\nspontaneously.\n\n\n   Waechtershaeuser dismisses the latter approach as the broth\ntheory because even when a researcher has found conditions under\nwhich the individual chemical ingredients of life may have been\nformed, it is hard to explain why they should then assemble\nthemselves into living cells.\n\n\n   He calls his own proposal the iron sulfur world theory because\nhe believes that the metallic surfaces, particularly those of the\ncommon mineral iron sulfide, would have been promising\nfacilitators, or catalysts, of the chemical reactions that created\nthe precursor chemicals of living cells.\n\n\n   It is unusual for amateurs, even qualified chemists like\nWaechtershaeuser, to contribute to the specialized worlds of modern\nscience. And his ideas, being only theoretical, did not arouse much\nenthusiasm until 1997 when he showed that an iron sulfur surface\ncould promote the conversion of carbon monoxide to a two-carbon\nchemical important in biochemistry of living cells.\n\n\n   To biochemists, his finding had particular resonance because at\nthe center of many enzymes are iron and sulfur atoms that transfer\nelectrons in ways vital the cell's energy requirements. The idea\nthat living cells result from some primitive chemical cycle that\ngot going on an iron sulfur surface is to them not so alien.\n\n\n   Cody and his colleagues decided to use a special high pressure\napparatus to explore how Waechtershaeuser's proposed system might\nwork in locations like the volcanic vents in the deep ocean. This\nkind of chemistry is a dangerous pursuit since at high pressures\nwater becomes a violent acid and carbon monoxide eats through\nsteel.\n\n\n   ``We set out to explore the ability of minerals to catalyze\nreactions that would be important in a primitive metabolic sense,''\nCody said. Putting iron sulfur, a source of carbon monoxide, into\ntheir reaction tube, ``we came across an unanticipated result,'' he\nsaid, referring to the large amount of pyruvate formed. The tube\nalso contained a hydrogen sulfidelike chemical to mimic the\nhydrogen sulfide produced by volcanoes.\n\n\n   Pyruvate consists of three carbon atoms linked together, and is\nan obvious building block from which sugars and the other\ncarbon-based molecules of life can be constructed.\n\n\n   Waechtershaeuser believes the origin of life lies in a process\nknown as autocatalysis, the emergence of some natural chemical\nprocess, like the pyruvate-producing one, in which the products\nhelp the reaction go faster.\n\n\n   ``Evolution is better and better autocatalysis,'' he said in a\nphone interview Thursday.\n\n\n   If one of these autocatalytic processes started to generate the\nclass of fatty chemicals",

The resulting plasma is electromagnetically energized\nin the central cell by ion cyclotron resonance heating. In this\nprocess radio waves give their energy to plasma, heating it in a\nmanner similar to the way a microwave oven works.\n\n\nAfter heating, the plasma is magnetically exhausted at the aft\ncell to provide modulated thrust. The aft cell is a magnetic\nnozzle, which converts the energy of the plasma into velocity of\nthe jet exhaust, while protecting any nearby structure and\nensuring efficient plasma detachment from the magnetic field.\n\n\nA key to the technology is the capability to vary, or modulate,\nthe plasma exhaust to maintain optima propulsive efficiency. This\nfeature is like an automobile's transmission which best uses the\npower of the engine, either for speed when driving on a level\nhighway, or for torque over hilly terrain.\n\n\nOn a mission to Mars, such a rocket would continuously\naccelerate through the first half of its voyage, then reverse its\nattitude and slow down during the second half. The flight could\ntake slightly over three months, while a conventional chemical\nmission would take seven to eight months and involve long periods\nof unpowered drift en route.",

Stanley Pons and Martin Fleischmann are still true believers,\nas are other scientists and enthusiasts scattered around the globe\nwho still see a glimmer of hope. Even the federal government keeps\na few researchers investigating the topic, though inconspicuously.\n\n\n   Ten years ago today, on March 23, 1989, Pons, then chairman of\nthe chemistry department at the University of Utah, and\nFleischmann, a top British chemist at the University of\nSouthampton, set the world of science on its head by announcing in\nSalt Lake City that they had achieved nuclear fusion at room\ntemperature in a jar of water.\n\n\n   They claimed, in effect, to have tamed the sun, unleashing its\nmight on earth without destructive side effects.\n\n\n   Hailed in headlines as the greatest discovery since fire, cold\nfusion was seen as promising to provide a safe, cheap and virtually\ninexhaustible form of power, ending human dependence on oil and\nredrawing the geopolitical map to make Salt Lake City the energy\ncapital of the world.\n\n\n   Best of all, it was outrageously simple to do. The test\napparatus cost a pittance and centered on palladium rods in a jar\nof heavy water, in which normal hydrogen is replaced by deuterium,\nan isotope of hydrogen that is ubiquitous in sea water.\n\n\n   The two said that an electric current passing through the test\ncell produced excess heat. Somehow, they said, atoms of deuterium\nwere forced to fuse together, paving the way for a new age.\n\n\n   But the dream soon faded. Skeptics rushed forward. And after a\nfew hectic months, cold fusion collapsed as most scientists were\nunable to match the startling results. Heavy blows were landed by\nsuch giants as the California Institute of Technology and a\n22-member federal panel made up mainly of top university\nscientists, which said the reported find was too good to be true.\n\n\n   In particular, it found no credible evidence of bursts of\nneutrons, which the Utah team had claimed as key proof of nuclear\nalchemy.\n\n\n   Frank Close, a physicist with top positions at the Oak Ridge\nNational Laboratory in Tennessee and the Rutherford Laboratory in\nBritain, went further. In ``Too Hot to Handle'' (Princeton, 1991),\nhe charged that crucial evidence in the original claim was so\nskewed as to be ``invented,'' an allegation the two claimants\ndenied.\n\n\n   Surprisingly, despite a decadelong cold bath of criticism, cold\nfusion is still alive today and apparently doing well in the\nscientific underground. Researchers around the globe quietly claim\nsuccess at getting tantalizing results, if not blistering heats\nready to topple the status quo. This hum of low-level work\nconfounds skeptics and delights believers.\n\n\n   ``It's as alive as it's always been,'' Fleischmann, 72, said in\na telephone interview from his home in Britain. Successful tests,\nhe added, continue to show that whatever is happening has to be\nnuclear in nature.\n\n\n   ``It can't be chemical,'' he said. ``The energy quantities are\ntoo large, orders of magnitude larger.''\n\n\n   A Fellow of the Royal Society, the top honorary group for\nBritish scientists, Fleischmann painted a picture of conspiracy in\nwhich cold fusion was killed politically by a cabal of oil- and\nhot-fusion interests, among others.\n\n\n   Over the decades, scientists have spent billions of dollars to\nmimic the sun's hot-fusion reactions on earth. But that research\nhas remained a scientific curiosity, and its practitioners were\nquick to question cold fusion, which in theory was a potential\nrival.\n\n\n   ``We've had incredible disinformation,'' Fleischmann said in the\ninterview. He added that he himself was still exploring cold fusion\nexperimentally, but would not say where or with what success.\n\n\n   The other half of the pair, Pons, 56, left the University of\nUtah in 1991 and now lives in France. Colleagues say he still backs\nthe claims but is bitter over their public denunciation. ``He\ndoesn't want to talk to the press,'' said Jean-Paul Biberian, a\nphysicist at the University of Grenoble who is in contact with\nPons.\n\n\n   Biberian, who said",
