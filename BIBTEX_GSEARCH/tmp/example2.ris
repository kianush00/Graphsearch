AB  - Abstract
Extended shelf life and convenient industrial application have led to increasingly wide use of drying technology in fruits and vegetables processing. However, drying process usually has a negative effect on the active ingredients in fruits and vegetables. In this study, the effects of three thermal drying methods (hot air drying (HD), microwave drying (MD) and combined microwave-hot-air-drying (CD)) on phenolic profiles, their bioaccessibility and antioxidant activity in Rhodomyrtus tomentosa berries were estimated. The total phenolics, flavonoids and anthocyanins contents of CD-berries were significantly higher than those of HD- and MD-ones. CD-berries had higher contents of individual phenolics and showed stronger antioxidant activity than HD- and MD-ones. Conversely, the bioaccessibility of phenolics in HD-berries was remarkably higher than that of MD- and CD-ones, although the latter 2 provided more bioaccessible phenolics than the former after inÂ vitro gastrointestinal digestion. Thus, combined microwave-hot-air-drying (CD) is a more suitable drying technique for Rhodomyrtus tomentosa berries to maintain their phenolics and antioxidant activity.
