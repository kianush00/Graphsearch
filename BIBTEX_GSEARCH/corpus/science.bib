abstract = "Abstract Sea buckthorn (SBT) is an ideal plant for ecological management and thus planted widely in western China. Its fruit is of high nutritional and medicinal values. However, its economic value is far from development because of high cost for harvesting \{SBT\} fruits. Mechanical vibration is one of feasible way to make fruit separation. To design proper vibratory harvesters for tree crops, the vibration harvesting mechanism of \{SBT\} was simulated and analyzed by the finite element method. First, a three-dimensional solid model of \{SBT\} tree was built by Pro/E and imported into ANSYS. Next, modal analysis was performed to determine the natural vibration properties of \{SBT\} tree such as the natural frequency and vibration mode. Finally, harmonic response analysis was applied to determine the steady-state response when a sine load was added to the \{SBT\} tree. The modal analysis results indicated that the first twenty order natural frequencies of \{SBT\} tree varied from 6.6 Hz (the first order frequency) to 31.8 Hz (the twentieth order frequency). Results of harmonic response analysis showed that the application of vibration force to the side branches is effective than to the trunk, with a slight damage to the tree. Moreover, the vibration force applied to the side branches was 58–78 N with a frequencies range of from 20 to 30 Hz, which ensured that the majority of \{SBT\} fruits were harvested from the tree. The simulation analysis results obtained in this study could provide a basis for the design and development of \{SBT\} vibration harvesters. "

abstract = "Abstract Stone fruit is cooled after harvesting to extend its shelf life and prevent postharvest losses. Because it is quickly subject to chilling injuries at inappropriate temperatures, its thermal properties should be known in order to design an optimum cooling process. However, how long does it take for an olive to reach its storage temperature at the stone–pulp interface? This paper proposes approximated equations as a model for predicting cooling times at the stone–pulp interface and for measuring the thermal diffusivity of the pulp and the external heat transfer coefficient. The model is based on a solution in Fourier series for the conduction of heat in spheres with an inner concentric, insulating spherical core, as a model of conduction of heat in stone fruits. "

abstract = "Abstract Freshly harvested fruits and vegetables (produce) are chilled to extend their shelf life but the chilling process increases opportunities for contamination by pathogenic bacteria carried by water through openings such as stem scars. Using tomato as a representative system, a 3D porous medium transport model is developed. The model simulates the transport of water vapor, liquid water, bacteria, and energy in light of convection–diffusion processes driven by pressure gradients from condensation inside as well as by water concentration gradients between the cooling water and that in the tomato. Results show that increasing the rate of cooling (i.e., creating a higher temperature difference) increases the rate of infiltration due to higher-pressure gradients. A higher temperature differential drives bacteria further into the tomato. A less hydrated tomato will incur deeper and more extensive infiltration. Size, permeability, and diffusivity play a less significant role. The novel mechanistic understanding our study provides should aid in designing safer hydrocooling processes. "

abstract = "Abstract The residues from the harvest of persimmon fruit will be thermally valorised by means of high temperature reactions within a spouted bed reactor. With the aim to obtain valuable information for the design of the device, the thermo-chemical processes were simulated by multi-rate linear non-isothermal Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) using \{O2\} as carrier gas. In addition, a set of analyses were carried out using Ar as carrier gas in order to evaluate the influence of the atmosphere (oxidative or inert conditions) on the decomposition of the samples evaluating the reactions of pyrolysis. The release of gases was monitored by Evolved Gas Analysis (EGA) with in-line Fourier Transformed Infrared (FT-IR) analysis. The thermo-chemical reaction was mathematically described through the definition of the main kinetic parameters: activation energy (Ea), pre-exponential factor (ln A) and model and order of reaction (n). The so-called kinetic triplet was calculated through the application of a methodology based on complementary iso-conversional methods. These results will be the initial parameters that will help design the Spouted Bed Reactor and it is envisaged that they will be used in computer simulation software to achieve a better understanding of the process to obtain the optimum operational parameters.
