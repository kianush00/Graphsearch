abstract = "Abstract The strawberry tree (Arbutus unedo L.) fruits are used in small quantities for fresh consumption despite their excellent flavor. The aim of this work was to evaluate the storage ability of strawberry tree fruits for fresh consumption. Harvested fruits were stored in polystyrene foam trays covered with two film types: linear low density polyethylene of 10 μm thickness (PPL) or polyethylene film perforated with holes of 10 mm diameter spaced 50 mm (PP). Through 15 days storage at 0, 3 and 6 °C, fruits were analyzed for quality parameters. The strawberry tree fruits presented relevant qualitative properties and were appreciated by panelists. Color parameters (L*, h°, C*) had higher decrease at 3 and 6 °C than at 0 °C. The °Brix almost did not change and firmness decreased mainly in the first 4 days storage. Ethanol and weight loss increased with temperature mostly from 3 to 6 °C. Strawberry tree fruits are a good source of ascorbic acid, glucose, fructose, anthocyanins and antioxidant activity. Those properties are maintained through 15 days storage at 0 °C followed by 3 °C. Film covers showed no significant differences between them. The temperature of 0 °C was the best for preservation of fruit quality through 15 days shelf-life. "

We evaluated the antioxidant capacity of ripe barberry fruits as compared to pear, orange, apple, strawberry and blueberry. In a second set of experiments ripe barberry fruit was harvested and treated with ethylene and 1-MCP and the changes in ethylene production and respiration rate during storage were assessed. Finally, ripe barberries were harvested and stored at 0, 5 or 10 °C for 0, 3, 7, 11 or 15 days. During this period we determined weight loss, respiration rate, the percentage of rotten and physiologically decayed berries, firmness, sugar content, acidity, pH, anthocyanins, phenolics and antiradical capacity. Barberries showed 10-fold higher antioxidant capacity than apple, orange and pear and superseded four times that of antioxidant-rich fruits such as blueberry. 1-MCP treatments increased ethylene production suggesting that the hormone auto inhibits it biosynthesis. The fruit stored best at 0 °C and this should be the recommended temperature to minimize deterioration and prevent losses of bio-active compounds. The fruits show a non-climacteric physiology, with ethylene biosynthesis being under negative feedback control. Barberries are an extraordinary high source of antioxidants among fruits. "

They are, however, perishable living products that require coordinated actions by growers, storage operators, processors, and retailers to maintain their quality and reduce food loss and waste. Recent advances in shelf life extension have been achieved by the combination of treatments including suitable temperature, humidity, and gas composition that maintain their quality and safety. Fresh produce attributes such as appearance, texture, flavour and nutritional value have been traditional quality criteria, but increasingly safety and traceability are important for all the role players along the supply chain from the farm to consumer. Non-destructive techniques for analysing the quality of fresh produce are valuable tools applicable along the supply chain. Advances in optical methods were touched in this perspective article pointing to new methods to inform the user. Quality deterioration and microbial contamination leading to spoilage and postharvest losses can occur at any of the supply chain stages. Therefore, postharvest treatments are essential to minimise quality loss, microbial spoilage and reduce the risk of pathogen contamination. Various postharvest physical, chemical and gaseous treatments can be applied to maintain fresh-like quality without compromising the sensory and nutritional aspects. The consequences of these techniques on quality and safety of fresh horticultural commodities are highlighted in this paper. Future research should aim at improving organoleptic quality and meeting safety standards of fresh produce at all steps of the supply chain. "

In this study, 251 fresh fruit samples including several varieties of grapes, strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, blackberries, and various citrus fruits were surface-disinfected, incubated at room temperature for up to 14 days without supplemental media, and subsequently examined for mould and yeast growth. The level of contamination (percent of contaminated items/sample) varied depending on the type of fruit. All raspberry and blackberry samples were contaminated at levels ranging from 33% to 100%, whereas 95% of the blueberry samples supported mould growth at levels between 10% and 100% of the tested berries, and 97% of strawberry samples showed fungal growth on 33–100% of tested berries. The most common moulds isolated from these commodities were Botrytis cinerea, Rhizopus (in strawberries), Alternaria, Penicillium, Cladosporium and Fusarium followed by yeasts, Trichoderma and Aureobasidium. Thirty-five percent of the grape samples tested were contaminated and supported fungal growth; the levels of contamination ranged from 9% to 80%. The most common fungi spoiling grapes were Alternaria, B. cinerea and Cladosporium. Eighty-three percent of the citrus fruit samples showed fungal growth at levels ranging from 25% to 100% of tested fruits. The most common fungi in citrus fruits were Alternaria, Cladosporium, Penicillium, Fusarium and yeasts. Less common were Trichoderma, Geotrichum and Rhizopus. "

Another impetus for such a focus on research should be that consumers are looking for the nutraceutical values of fruits and vegetables, that is, their constituents such as carotenoids, flavonoids and other polyphenols, phenolic acids, and other phytonutrients, which are even more susceptible to variations in temperature, relative humidity, concentrations of oxygen, carbon dioxide, etc. An attempt was made equally to exemplify the main horticultural crop species; frequent reference to some of these is related to the level of scientific reports, which relates to their storability (pome fruits vs. stone fruits), short lifecycle (vegetables vs. fruits), and economic importance. An example of physiological mechanisms is climacteric (eg, tomato, apple, or banana) and nonclimacteric (eg, strawberry, citrus, and grape berries) fruits. References to other reviews on specific crops or quality attributes have been made as well. Among the large spectrum of biochemical and structural modifications during the growth and maturation of harvested plant parts, those with a major impact on global quality and storability are referred to and discussed how abiotic stresses affect these. We focus on the role of abiotic factors on processes related to structural modifications of the flesh due to depolymerization of principal components of cell walls and loss of cell turgor, which affect texture. Other important processes discussed at some detail involve modifications of nutritional and organoleptic value of fruits due to an increase in mono- and disaccharides following starch hydrolysis and/or de novo synthesis, biosynthesis of volatile compositions, and the degradation of organic acids. Modifications of color due to a degradation of chlorophyll and accumulation of carotenoids and/or flavonoids in relation to light and temperature levels at the farm level have received increased attention in recent research. Finally, we review how abiotic factors determine susceptibility to pathogens and the response of fruits, for instance, by accumulating defense proteins. This structure enables us to concentrate on the biological processes elucidated by the most recent scientific knowledge. "

In this study, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method was developed to determine concentrations of adenylate, i.e. adenosine triphosphate (ATP), adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and adenosine monophosphate (AMP), in postharvest banana fruits. Boiling water extracting adenylate from banana fruits was suitable because of its high extraction rate and stability. \{HPLC\} method exhibited good repeatability (variation coefficients of 1.51%–3.42%) and recovery rate (93.9%–97.8%). The correlation coefficients of ATP, \{ADP\} and \{AMP\} with peak areas in a range of 1–120 mg/L were 0.999965, 0.999995 and 0.999996, respectively. Through analyzing adenylate concentrations and membrane hydrolysis-related enzyme activities (phospholipase D and lipoxygenase, ab. \{PLD\} and LOX, two key enzymes catalyzing membrane lipid degradation) in banana fruits stored at different temperatures (7 °C, 14 °C and 25 °C), it could be found that appropriate low temperature (14 °C) delayed fruit senescence by maintaining high energy level. Chilly stress (7 °C) accelerated fruit senescence by declining energy supply level, accompanying by activation of membrane hydrolysis-related enzymes such as \{PLD\} and LOX. These results were helpful for elucidating relationship between energy metabolism and senescence regulation during chilling injury in postharvest banana fruits. "

This study attempted to establish robust \{NIRS\} models to predict mango internal quality, regardless of the conditions encountered by fruits on the tree and after harvest. A database involving mangoes (n = 250) from different production years and orchards and which were harvested at different maturity stages and stored at different temperatures for various periods was used to characterize mango quality using NIRS. The large variations measured in mango total soluble solid (TSS) content, dry matter, flesh color and acidity ensured that the dataset considered in this study covered differences in quality levels that can be encountered for the mango cultivar studied. Variable selection procedures and pre-processing techniques were used to improve the performance of the Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) models that accurately predicted the mango quality traits studied, regardless of the origins and storage conditions. The root mean square errors in prediction (RMSEP) were 0.6°Brix, 1.4%, 5.9 meq 100 g FM−1 and 3.16°Brix for the \{TSS\} content, dry matter content, titratable acidity and the hue angle of flesh color, respectively. The results presented in this study confirmed that robust \{NIRS\} models can be developed to predict mango quality by considering the pre- and post-harvest factors involved in fruit quality. Further studies should assess the use of \{NIR\} spectra on fruits to address internal quality variation issues, as well as the ability of \{NIRS\} to predict fruit shelf life and eating quality at harvest.

Traditional packaging can no longer effectively and sufficiently meet today’s needs. The concept of active packaging has been defined as a packaging system actively changing the condition of the package to improve food safety, extend shelf life, enhance sensory properties, and maintain the quality of the products. In order to modify environmental or physiological conditions within the food package, active-packaging systems usually involve scavenging or absorption of undesirable compounds such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, ethylene, flavor/odor, and excessive water. Compounds such as carbon dioxide, antioxidants, and preservatives are added or released into the headspace of the package by other active-packaging systems by using sachets, labels, or films. Moreover, temperature control active packaging is classified as insulating materials and self-heating and self-cooling cans. Conventional active plastic technologies or active sachets are gradually being replaced by active nanocomposites for improving the quality and safety of packaged food products. Active nanocomposite films that incorporating oxygen scavengers could be used for packaging a variety of oxygen-sensitive food products. Also, nanocomposites could be applied as antimicrobial packaging to control undesirable microorganisms in foods. Due to consumer preferences for minimally processed and naturally preserved foods and the food industry’s interest in investing in product quality and safety, active packaging will develop in the future. Further studies are needed regarding different areas of active-packaging systems. "

Uninoculated and inoculated fruits were washed first with distilled water (DW), calcium oxide (CaO), fumaric acid (FA), and \{SAEW\} at \{RT\} for 3 min. Combinations were performed by adding treatment one at a time to \{SAEW\} as following FA + SAEW, CaO + FA + SAEW, and CaO + FA + SAEW + ultrasonication (US) or microbubbles (MB). All the sanitizer treatments resulted in significant (p &lt; 0.05) bacterial reduction compared to \{DW\} used as control. Increasing the treatments in combination from FA + SAEW to CaO + FA + SAEW + US resulted in an increased bacterial decontamination. The cavitation induced by ultrasonication in FA + SAEW solution resulted in a higher additive effect in decontamination of Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Listeria monocytogenes compare to the agitation generated by microbubble generator in FA + SAEW solution. CaO + FA + SAEW and CaO + FA + SAEW + US were effective in improving the microbial safety and quality of apple fruits. However, additional treatment of \{US\} impacted on the quality of tomato fruits during storage at RT. Therefore, a combination of \{SAEW\} with sanitizers (CaO and FA) and mechanical force (Ultrasonication) has the potential to be used in postharvest sanitation processing in the fresh fruit industry.

Discontinuous use of the cooling operation, including 12 h on/12 h off; 10 h on/14 h off; and 8 h on/16 h off, was also investigated. The study showed that the air circulation fan is the major source of heat load. Hence, an attempt to reduce energy cost should first deliberate on reducing the fan operation time.

abstract = "Abstract The successful storage of perishable crops after harvest has been a critical concern in human societies for as long as agriculture has been practiced. Civilizations flourish when their populace has access to a nutritious food supply long after crop harvest. Although advances in technology provide modernity with new or improved methods for better and longer storage, today's challenges are very similar to those the ancients faced: how to retain the nutritive, sensory, and otherwise utilizable value of the crop for as long as possible with minimal loss or degradation. In those societies where food abundance exists, successful storage of the excess harvest is essential for releasing it to the marketplace at the most economically opportune time. Thus, crop storage capacity is one of the most fundamental economic pillars of any civilization. This article focuses on key historical, physiological, and biochemical aspects, as well as related technical and process facets of crop storage science with emphasis on fruits and vegetables. At its conclusion, it is hoped that the reader will understand that with the capacity to store food crops well, societies flourish; without that capacity, they do not. "

Promotion of healthy eating and increasing world population are driving global transactions and consumption of fruits and vegetables; efforts to make the transactions cost-effective, reduce supply chain waste, and carbon footprint are driving the increased use of modified atmosphere packaging and other technologies that preserve fresh produce freshness during such transactions. The principles of the packaging, the benefits, and potential pitfalls are discussed. Ultimately, successful implementation and sustained success of modified atmosphere packaging is dependent on a holistic approach that takes into consideration numerous factors, including, but not limited to a packaging design that provides optimal modified atmosphere conditions and yet is tolerant to inevitable temperature breaches in the supply chain, good carton design that allows for adequate ventilation, sanitation, prompt cooling, and good temperature management throughout the cold chain. Successful control and management of these factors opens up opportunities for use of modified atmosphere packaging for reducing waste in the supply chain, sea as opposed to air freight, season extension, and consistently high produce quality and taste experience for the consumer. Examples of these applications are provided. "

After transportation, cherries were submitted to a commercialisation period. Our results show that modified atmosphere packaging using polypropylene films of intermediate permeability (238 ml \{O2\} m−2 h−1 atm−1 or 423 ml \{O2\} m−2 h−1 atm−1) extends postharvest cherry shelf life up to 15–20 days at 5 °C. Under these conditions acidity levels remain higher, anthocyanin synthesis is reduced, lower level of oxidative enzymes are detected, and texture and sensorial quality improve. Moreover, films of intermediate permeability allow a temporal breakage of the cold chain without any reduction in sensorial quality of the cherries. "

Withdrawal of normal fertilization prior to and at various stages during floral induction did not affect yield and berry size, but marginally advanced flowering and fruit ripening. The successive stages of floral initiation and differentiation were studied and identified by scanning electron microscopy of the uppermost lateral buds of plants grown for six weeks under naturally decreasing autumn photoperiods at temperatures of 9, 15 and 21 °C. Low temperature advanced floral initiation, and advanced and enhanced flowering and berry yield in the following season. However, at variance from earlier studies, the plants eventually initiated flower primordia even at 21 °C. Marginal low temperature and short day conditions during the last days before the temperature treatments were started on 17 September might possibly have reduced the subsequent induction requirements enough to explain this unexpected result. Correlation analyses revealed an over-all positive correlation between fruit weight and drupelet numbers (r = 0.568, P = 0.01). In berries from the early harvests, the number of drupelets per berry increased with decreasing temperature, while the numbers converged to the same level regardless of temperature in the later harvests. Based on the progress of the floral initiation process at the various temperatures, we interpret this to mean that only the early initiated flowers, that gave rise to the early maturing berries, were differentiated during the actual period of controlled temperature exposure, whereas the remaining flowers were differentiated afterwards when all plants were exposed to identical low temperature conditions. Increased femaleness under optimal floral induction conditions is in agreement with results in both monoecious and dioecious plants and circumstantial evidence suggest that, in the raspberry, this might be mediated by changes in gibberellin activity which acts as a male sexual hormone in plants and is known to inhibit growth cessation and floral initiation in raspberry.

Quality and stability of F&amp;V depend on the cultivar, preharvest practices, climacteric conditions, maturity at harvest, harvesting methodology, and postharvest conditions, making shelf life prediction a difficult task when compared with other food products. Postharvest deterioration can be controlled by reducing the storage temperature and respiration rate and by modification of the gas atmosphere surrounding the product which would improve stability and extend the shelf life of fresh produce. Controlled atmosphere and modified atmosphere packaging technologies still remain effective tools for extending the shelf life of F&amp;V; however it can be further enhanced by using novel disinfection techniques, active packaging, and additional hurdles technologies against produce deterioration. Moreover, the stability of any packaging solutions can be well monitored and evaluated by utilizing nondestructive quality techniques. "

In the first experiment the effects of different harvest dates (9 September, 1 October, 22 October and 13 November), in the second experiment five harvest times-of-day (07.00, 10.00, 13.00, 16.00 and 19.00 O’clock) at two dates of harvest (16 September and 17 October) and finally in the third study the effect of picking methods (branch cutting and berry picking) and drying methods (sun drying and shade drying) were studied on quantitative and qualitative indices of seedless barberry. Results showed that the highest fresh and dry fruit yields were obtained at the final harvest date (13 November) in the first experiment. Moreover, the brix, pH and anthocyanin fruit content were increased but total titratable acidity was decreased by delaying in harvest date. Qualitative indices of seedless barberry were in maximum values before sunrise, then were decreased until noon and after that were increased until sunset. The maximum and minimum brix values were obtained at 07.00 and 10.00 (12.7% and 9.7%, respectively).

abstract = "Abstract In the supply chain of fresh fruit and vegetables, large losses may incurred throughout the whole farm to fork route. Food supply chain management is faced with challenges of minimizing the post-harvest loss, while delivering the items directly to the refrigerators in smart homes (i.e. domotics). A substantial value can therefore be added to the criterion function by an immediate, real-time detection of changes in perishability dynamics, including a real-time calculation and communication of the remaining shelf life during transportation from one chain node to another. The changes in the estimated remaining shelf life can, therefore, be matched with the expected remaining transportation time, and so the critical moment can be avoided with a given probability. This can be done by dynamic rerouting in real time, based on previous net present value (NPV) criteria. Such criteria could then we include in the contractually stipulated remaining shelf life requirements at the delivery point. This paper focuses on a novel concept of moving activity cells which represent the moving cargo between the fixed activity cells in the extended material requirements planning (EMRP) model. The changes in \{NPV\} are calculated dynamically from the expected shelf life changes. Such real-time calculations and early reports are enabled by the Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure, where there is a smart device that tracks ambient conditions like temperature, humidity, and gas concentrations. These early estimations allow a better decision making based on first-expired-first-out (FEFO) cold chain management strategies for perishable products. Therefore, the model includes the possibility to deliver the items to the local market if the expected contractually stipulated shelf-life losses become too high. The paper does not intend to discuss the details of IoT or analyse different sensors, but it wishes to show how the \{EMRP\} theory can be used to estimate the changes in \{NPV\} when moving activity cells are included in the model. The smart measurement devices embedded in moving activity cells of cyber-physical system measure the ambient data and broadcast decay acceleration factors and postharvest loss of cargo to the decision support system. The numerical example shows how smart measurement devices embedded in moving activity cells of cyber-physical system help to reduce the post-harvest loss in a supply chain by rerouting when necessary. The paper additionally shows how much such a cyber-physical system improves \{NPV\} by the development of decision-making processes in the real-time, using the IoT as infrastructure, including automatic rerouting in postharvest logistics.

This paper addresses the combined effect of the harvesting time (H1, \{H2\} and H3) with or without 1-MCP (T and C) treatment and the postsharvest storage in different temperature regimes (0 °C, 8 °C and dual temperature regime, 0/8 °C). The ‘Songold’ plum was kept for 30 and 50 days in cold storage and at 20 °C for 5 days after that (shelf-life, SL). For each analysis date, physical and chemical quality parameters were established (weight loss, firmness, colour, total soluble solids and acidity), together with postharvest damage (chilling injuries and decay). In general, the 1-MCP reduced the firmness loss and colour changes (L* and b*), maintaining the acidity of the fruit at rates close to those of the ones at harvest. The use of 1-MCP allows us to market the fruit at a more advanced ripening stage and to store it at a higher temperature without quality loss. Chilling injuries (CI) were the most relevant damages, mainly in \{H2\} at 8 °C after 50 + 5 days. 1-MCP appears to reduce the impact of \{CI\} but not decay. "

Proteomic analysis allowed the identification of 64 proteins regulated by heat treatment. Most of the up-regulated proteins in heat-treated grape berries were related to defense response and redox metabolism, suggesting a physiological adaptation to environmental stress. In addition, the increased expression of proteins associated with carbohydrate and energy metabolism immediately after \{HWT\} provided a molecular explanation for the rapid decline of soluble sugar content observed in heat-treated grape berries, which might be necessary for activation of the energy-demanding defense response to storage environmental stress, thereby reduced postharvest loss during storage at low temperature.

The rapidly growing demand for fresh citrus fruits and their derivative products has prompted researchers to study factors affecting the vitamin C content. This review discusses postharvest factors influencing vitamin C content of citrus fruits. Vitamin C content in citrus fruits can be influenced by several factors such as postharvest treatment, storage conditions as well as oxidative stress. Postharvest treatments such as surface coating, heat treatments, irradiation, and ethylene degreening lead to better vitamin C retention. Additionally, improper temperature management may negatively affect the nutritional quality of the stored produce; vitamin C loss is intensified at higher storage temperatures. Although storage conditions favorable to water loss are known to accelerate vitamin C loss, the effect of low relative humidity (RH) on vitamin C content of citrus fruits has not yet been fully elucidated. Vitamin C retention is also improved when citrus fruits are stored in modified atmosphere packaging and controlled atmosphere (CA). Although the effect of postharvest treatments on vitamin C content has been intensively studied, the influence of chemical treatments warrants more research. "

In this work, the mixed micelle formation between the ionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) and the phenolic acid salicylic acid have been studied at several temperatures in aqueous solution. The critical micelle concentration and the micellization degree were determined by conductometric techniques and the experimental data used to calculate several useful thermodynamic parameters, like standard free energy, enthalpy and entropy of micelle formation. Salicylic acid helps the micellization of SDS, both by increasing the additive concentration at a constant temperature and by increasing temperature at a constant concentration of additive. The formation of micelles of \{SDS\} in the presence of salicylic acid was a thermodynamically spontaneous process, and is also entropically controlled. Salicylic acid plays the role of a stabilizer, and gives a pathway to control the three-dimensional water matrix structure. The driving force of the micellization process is provided by the hydrophobic interactions. The isostructural temperature was found to be 307.5 K for the mixed micellar system.

Cold storage was effective in delaying weight loss, softening and microbial growth and also in maintaining a better sensory quality of the blackberries. What’s more, under refrigeration it was possible to extend the shelf-life of the fruit to up to 8 d. The main limiting factors for shelf-life were microbial growth and loss of firmness at room storage and cold storage, respectively. Based on these results, it would be advisable to harvest the fruit at maturity stage 5 in order to achieve an appropriate fruit size, a high anthocyanin concentration, a better sugars/acids equilibrium, and a better sensory quality and the fruit should be maintained under refrigerated storage.

Depending on the crop and the distance to market, transport can be by land, sea, or air, and the transport time can be a significant part of product storage life. Maintenance of quality during transport is achieved primarily by temperature management, but this can be challenging as it involves attention to loading and in-transit conditions. Other factors that are important during transport include appropriate packaging to minimize bruising and other injuries; application of modified atmosphere storage; attention to product compatibilities such as optimal temperature regimes, odor, and ethylene production and absorption; and chemical contamination of organic products. Requirements to meet procedures during transport to address food safety concerns are becoming increasingly important. "

In grapes (Vitis vinifera L.), light exposure can have a strong effect on fruit quality and commercial value; however, the mechanisms of light action are not well understood. The role of fruit-localized photoreceptors in the control of berry quality traits was evaluated under field conditions in a commercial vineyard in Mendoza (Argentina). Characterization of the diurnal dynamics of the fruit light environment in a vertical trellis system indicated that clusters were shaded by leaves during most of the photoperiod. Supplementation of the fruit light environment from 20 days before veraison until technological harvest showed that red (R, 660 nm) and blue (B, 470 nm) light strongly increased total phenolic compound levels at harvest in the berry skins without affecting sugar content, acidity or berry size. Far-red (FR, 730 nm) and green (G, 560 nm) light supplementation had relatively small effects. The stimulation of berry phytochromes and cryptochromes favored accumulation of flavonoid and non-flavonoid compounds, including anthocyanins, flavonols, flavanols, phenolic acids and stilbenes. These results demonstrate that the chemical composition of grape berries is modulated by the light quality received by the clusters under field conditions, and that fruit photoreceptors are not saturated even in areas of high insolation and under management systems that are considered to result in a relatively high exposure of fruits to solar radiation. Therefore, manipulation of the light environment or the light sensitivity of fruits could have significant effects on critical grape quality traits. "

Because it is quickly subject to chilling injuries at inappropriate temperatures, its thermal properties should be known in order to design an optimum cooling process. However, how long does it take for an olive to reach its storage temperature at the stone–pulp interface? This paper proposes approximated equations as a model for predicting cooling times at the stone–pulp interface and for measuring the thermal diffusivity of the pulp and the external heat transfer coefficient. The model is based on a solution in Fourier series for the conduction of heat in spheres with an inner concentric, insulating spherical core, as a model of conduction of heat in stone fruits. "

The physicochemical properties and film coating efficiency of composite films with different concentrations of gelatin were also evaluated for viscosity, surface tension, pH, work of adhesion and spreading coefficient. The results were indicated that an increase in gelatin contents had an effect on the changes in work of the adhesion and spreading coefficient, and hence the film coating efficiency over a banana skin significantly changed. Among all the concentrations of gelatin, 40% gelatin exhibited the appropriate concentration for application as an edible film coating. Therefore, the composite film based on 60% shellac and 40% gelatin with and without \{PEG\} 400 at 5% as the edible coating solution for extending the shelf life of bananas was further investigated. The coating method of the composite film over bananas was prepared using a dipping technique. The temperature of all coated samples was kept stable at 25 °C for 30 days. Changes in physicochemical and microbiological properties such as colour, titratable acidity, total soluble sugar, weight loss, firmness and total moulds/yeasts counts were also investigated. Composite films, with and without \{PEG\} 400, can be applied as an edible coating for post-harvest fruits, and have beneficial effects on retarding the ripening process. They act as an effectively physical barrier around the fruit resulting in slow decreases in weight loss, softening, amount of acid and sugar and maintaining the quality of post-harvest fruits for more than 30 days, compared with uncoated fruits. Therefore, a composite film based on shellac and gelatin could be utilized and added to the value of fruits and vegetables by prolonging their post-harvest shelf life. "

After treatments microbial growth, weight loss, firmness, titratable acidity, soluble solid content, pH value, vitamin C, anthocyanin and total phenolics and antioxidant activity were evaluated at 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18 days of storage. Furthermore, the levels of zinc and the sensory attributes of treated strawberries were evaluated three days after treatment. Nano-ZnO treatments decreased the microbial load during fruit storage (total mesophilic bacteria in control and 0.5% nano-ZnO treated strawberries were 4.35 and 3.67 Log \{CFU\} g− 1, respectively). Treatments delayed weight loss, retained fruit firmness and maintained anthocyanin, vitamin C, phenol content and antioxidant activity at higher concentration than those of untreated fruit. Fruit sweetness and aftertaste attributes were not affected by treatments but the 0.5% ZnO treated fruit was less luminous (1.6) compared to control (5.6). 0.5% nano-ZnO was the most effective in delaying changes in the ripening and reducing microbial populations among the treatments. These findings indicated that the nano-ZnO might provide an alternative to maintain quality and control decay of fresh strawberries during extended storage. Industrial relevance Strawberries are a highly perishable fruit and postharvest life is limited to 4 days or even shorter at room temperature or 2 weeks at cold storage, therefore finding a method to extend the shelf life of strawberries is important. Modified atmosphere packaging is a useful method but control of spoilage microorganisms is still a problem. Fruit coating has great potential to extend fruit postharvest life and maintain nutritional quality. Nano-ZnO may be an effective alternative. "

abstract = "In rainfed vineyards water deficits play a major role in determining berry yield and composition. Therefore, reliable indicators of vine water status might be of great value for the optimization of grape yield and quality. In the present study the feasibility of using hyperspectral reflectance indices related to plant biophysical properties at predicting berry yield and quality attributes in rainfed vineyards is assessed. The study was conducted on Vitis vinifera cv. Chardonnay in commercial vineyards in the D.O. Penedès region (Catalonia, Spain) over two consecutive years (2007–2008). Field measurements of fractional intercepted Photosynthetic Active Radiation (fIPAR), canopy reflectance, predawn water potential (Ψp) and the canopy to air temperature difference at midday (ΔTmidday) were conducted at the stage of veraison. Yield, Total Soluble Solids (TSS), Titratable Acidity (TA) and the ratio TSS/TA (maturation index, IMAD) were determined at harvest. Contrasted water availability among vineyards prompted considerable variation in berry yield and quality attributes. Across years, higher yield was accompanied by higher \{TA\} (r = 0.59, p &lt; 0.01) and lower \{IMAD\} (r = − 0.63, p &lt; 0.01) while no significant relationship was observed between yield and TSS. Yield was related to canopy vigor (fIPAR) in a variable extend: in 2007, yield was positively related to fIPAR (r = 0.71, p &lt; 0.05) while yield was found to decrease along with increasing fIPAR in 2008 (r = − 0.62, p &lt; 0.05). Contrastingly, \{NDVI\} provided consistent estimates of yield across years (r = 0.57, p &lt; 0.05). These results suggest that \{NDVI\} might be more appropriate to characterize the effects of varying water availability on yield than fIPAR. In addition, yield was found to be related to ΔTmidday (r = − 0.63 and r = − 0.66, in 2007 and 2008, respectively). Accordingly, the Water Index (WI), an indicator of vine water status, provided robust estimates of yield across years (r = 0.61, p &lt; 0.01). The strength of the correlation between \{NDVI\} and \{WI\} vs. yield suggests that yield was influenced by changes in both leaf area (intercepted light) and photosynthesis (stomatal aperture) in a variable extent according to the timing and severity of water deficits in the years of study. Berry quality attributes did not show significant relationships against fIPAR but were related to ΔTmidday. Accordingly, \{NDVI\} did not show significant correlation with berry quality attributes, while \{WI\} was found to be consistently related to \{TA\} (r = 0.70, p &lt; 0.01) and \{IMAD\} (r = − 0.71, p &lt; 0.01) across years. The results obtained suggest that the \{WI\} might provide reliable estimates of berry quality attributes in vineyards experiencing moderate to severe water deficits with potential application in precision viticulture activities such as selective harvesting according to grape quality attributes as well as for ripening assessment.

The effect of storage temperature on nutrient level was also assessed. Fruit from Chile, Peru and Spain and harvested in the respective early, middle and late season were ripened for seven days at 18 or 23 °C. At specific intervals, mesocarp fatty acids and sugar profiles were identified. The oil composition differed according to origin and harvest-time, suggesting oleic acid as a potential marker in distinguishing fruit origin. Chilean fruit had higher oleic content (57–61%) follow by Spanish (54–60%) and Peruvian (40–47%) fruit. In early season fruit d-mannoheptulose content decreased during shelf life from 128 to 23.5 mg g−1 (Chile), from 115 to 33.6 mg g−1 (Peru), from 65.2 to 23.5 mg g−1 (Spain). A similar trend was noted in middle and late season fruit and from the three origins. For the first time a relationship between \{C7\} sugar content and mesocarp softening, fruit maturity and origin was identified. "

For the in vitro test, one-day old C. capitata eggs were exposed to increasing doses of UV-C radiation and stored in a B.O.D. chamber. Applying in vivo tests, ‘Kumagai’ guavas were exposed to artificial infestation by medfly. After infestation, the fruits were subjected to an increasing intensity of UV-C radiation and stored in a B.O.D. incubator at 23.0 ± 0.2 °C for about 20 days. In vitro tests indicated that 1.383 kJ m−2 UV-C on C. capitata eggs was capable of preventing the eclosion of larvae. However, guavas infested by medfly eggs needed 16.0 kJ m−2 of UV-C to prevent pupation. The guavas subjected to treatment with UV-C radiation and stored at a temperature of 8 ± 0.2 °C, obtained much better responses in terms of quality indices than those stored at 22 ± 0.2 °C, which lends credence to the storage temperature being a key factor in maintaining fruit quality.

In the current research, the effect of such treatments on the quality of table grapes (Vitis vinifera L. cv. Sultanina) has been evaluated. Individual berries or bunches of grapes were subjected to a range of temperatures (52.5–58 °C) for various time intervals (18–30 min). Following heat treatment, the fruit was stored at 20 °C and various quality parameters were measured over a 7 day period. Treatments at temperatures of 52.5 or 55 °C for times ranging from 18 to 27 min were found not to significantly affect bunch weight loss, berry firmness, berry colour, total soluble solids or acid concentrations. At higher temperatures (58 °C) or for extended time periods (e.g. 55 °C for 30 min), some negative effects were observed, namely increased weight loss and berry colour darkening compared with control bunches. In most of the treatments, the commercially significant quality defects of berry shatter and stem browning were reduced. It is concluded that vapour heat treatments can be applied to ‘Sultanina’ table grapes for disease control without compromising fruit quality. "

Among them, there are two equilibrium models which do not require expensive solution techniques and can be used to evaluate the process time, grain temperature and grain moisture content variations. This study deals with the evaluation of these models by comparing the simulation results with experimental data. Results showed that both models had good correlations with experimental data and presented a very similar performance. The two evaluated models can be easily implemented in computer programs, contributing to improvements in this process control and guaranteeing the management of grain quality during the storage period.

Harvest dates were before flowering (BF), at full bloom (FB), after flowering (AF) and 6 weeks after full bloom (6FB). Fruit internal quality was assessed by the percentage of juice (PJU), total soluble solids (TSS), titrable acidity (TA) and TSS:TA ratio. On orchard, between the first and the last harvest dates, \{PJU\} and \{TSS\} and \{TA\} decreased whereas TSS:TA increased sharply. \{PJU\} remained quite unchanged until after flowering, where it sharply declined leading to values near the minimum for marketing in 6FB fruit especially for small diameter ones. No clear chilling injuries were noticed even after more than 16 weeks at 6 °C. That temperature induced higher TA, lower TSS:TA ratio values and lower fruit weight loss than at 10 °C. Small diameter fruit weight loss was higher than that of large diameter fruit for both temperatures. For all harvest dates TSS, \{TA\} and TSS:TA were similar at the two tested periods for marketing (early July and end of August). By August, \{PJU\} of \{BF\} fruit was lower and close to the minimum value for marketing. Conversely, harvest date had a clear influence on decay with 30.7% of decay in \{BF\} fruit versus 5.5% in 6FB fruit by the end of experiment (end of August) mainly due to a longer storage duration and not to a higher sensitivity to decay of \{BF\} fruit. For short distance local summer marketing, we recommend to harvest grapefruit after flowering, but not too late, and to store them at 10 °C. "

abstract = "Abstract: Fruit and vegetables (F&amp;V) are living tissues and highly perishable products needing optimal post-harvest technologies in order to maintain their storage stability and extend shelf life. Growing consumer demand for convenience in food preparation and consumption, including product form, packaging, quality preservation, and year-round availability has been driving the F&amp;V marketing system to one with an increased focus on value added and cost minimization by streamlining of distribution. Quality and stability of F&amp;V depend upon the cultivar, pre-harvest practices, climacteric conditions, maturity at harvest, harvesting methodology and post-harvest conditions, making shelf life prediction a difficult task when compared with other food products. Post-harvest deterioration can be controlled by reducing the storage temperature and respiration rate by modification of the gas atmosphere surrounding the product which would improve stability and extend shelf life of fresh produce. Controlled atmosphere (CA) and modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) technologies have evolved in order to provide this benefit to F&amp;V during storage. "

In the present study, 2-butanol (a phospholipase D inhibitor) at different concentrations (0.05%, 0.10% and 0.15%) were applied postharvest to longan fruit stored at ambient temperature (25 °C), and their effects on fruit quality and physiological characteristics were investigated. The results showed that the 0.05% 2-butanol treatment had the most positive effects on fruit quality, with treated fruit showing a significant delay in changes in weight, titratable acidity content and total soluble solids content by day 8. The 0.05% 2-butanol treated fruit had the lowest rate of pericarp moisture loss on day 8 and a significantly lower browning index than the control on day 6. It also maintained higher ascorbic acid contents than in the control from day 2. This treatment maintained high contents of phenolics and flavonoids during 8 days storage, and inhibited browning, pulp breakdown and respiration. These results indicate that the phospholipase D inhibitor 2-butanol could be helpful in postharvest quality maintenance of longan fruit. "

Two important features of the heating systems were tracking of diurnal temperature dynamics, and maintaining relative humidity, hence avoiding the interaction between temperature and vapour pressure deficit. Minimum temperature was unchanged. Compared to controls, maximum ambient temperature was increased between 1.8 and 4.1 °C in treated plots but canopy temperature of treated vines only increased by 0.9–1.1 °C. Elevation of bunch temperature was 2.3–3.2 °C. Increasing temperature around budburst transiently accelerated development in comparison to controls; no phenological changes were detected for other timings of treatment. Yield averaged 4.3 kg vine−1 in 2007–08 and 6.1 kg vine−1 in 2008–09. In both seasons and for all timings of treatment, increasing temperature did not affect yield or its components; lack of yield response did not result, therefore, from compensatory mechanisms, e.g. heavier berries compensating for fewer fruit. The dynamics of berry growth and total soluble solids were largely unaffected by temperature. Under our experimental conditions, the capacity of irrigated Shiraz canopies to partially buffer a 2–4 °C increase in maximum ambient temperature may have been important for the maintenance of yield, and berry growth and sugar accumulation.

Two calcium application timings (from fruit set to veraison and from veraison to harvest) were compared to an untreated control. Clusters were sprayed with calcium chloride as Ca \{EDTA\} 44%. After each calcium application, bunch samples were collected and Ca2+ concentration was measured in berry compartments (skin, flesh and seeds). The main mechanical and chemical characteristics were measured on bunch samples at harvesting and during storage. In addition, the incidence of Botrytis cinerea rots, computed as McKinney index, was evaluated in field on natural inoculum and after harvesting on bunches artificially inoculated and maintained at room temperature. The highest Ca2+ concentrations were detected in skin tissues and after pre-veraison applications. Calcium accumulation in skin and flesh tissues stopped after veraison, whereas it continued up to ripening in seeds since the axial flow, differently from the peripheral, remains functional. In both years, calcium applications to bunches were effective both in maintaining postharvest fruit quality, as shown by flesh firmness and berry breaking force, and in reducing B. cinerea rots during storage. The applications were particularly efficacious if carried out between fruit set and veraison when stomata are functional and the re-translocation of calcium not directly absorbed by the bunches may occur via xylem transport.

To increase the temperatures in the environments of maturing fruit, we fixed electric heating cables around the fruit during the maturation period (6–3 weeks before estimated harvest date). This treatment increased the average temperatures, the daily minimum temperatures, and the daily maximum temperatures by 1.4–2.5 °C, 1.5–2.8 °C, and 0.8–1.7 °C, respectively. The incidences of watercore were statistically increased by heat treatment (P &lt; 0.01). In particular, the incidences of watercore in heated fruit were almost twice those of untreated fruit in Ibaraki in 2008 and Kumamoto in 2009. Furthermore, the fruit treated with higher temperatures showed increased flesh firmness, soluble solids contents, and pH at harvest, although the interactions (treatment × place/year) were also significant. These results imply that parameters of fruit quality, including the occurrence of watercore, are affected by the temperature of fruit during maturation, and that high temperatures give rise to watercore. Accordingly, we attempted to reduce the maximum daily fruit temperatures by putting shade hats over the fruit to see if this would reduce the incidence of watercore. Shade hat treatment decreased the daily maximum temperature by 0.5–2.2 °C during maturation without significantly altering the mean and daily minimum temperatures. Watercore incidence was reduced by shade hats in all experiments, however, the effects were not statistically significant. The temperatures in the tested years were very high, with mean and daily maximum temperatures around control fruit of over 28 °C and 34 °C, respectively. The results of this study suggest that shade hat treatment may not be enough to decrease temperatures around fruit and reduce the incidence of watercore. "

abstract = "Abstract Quality changes in the harvested fruit can be studied from two different angles, namely, postharvest physiology and postharvest pathology. Respiration is the predominant physiological process in harvested fruits. In contrast to most other fruits, citrus fruits are nonclimacteric. Their rate of postharvest respiration is low and does not show a tendency to increase. Detached citrus fruit does not ripen. The rate of respiration is faster at higher temperature. As long as the oxygen supply is adequate, the respiration quotient is close to unity. Respiration quotient values higher than unity indicate that fermentative processes are taking place, in addition to respiration. Respiration can be depressed by decreasing the concentration of oxygen or increasing the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere surrounding the fruit. In essence, this is the technology of “controlled atmosphere.” Another important postharvest change is moisture loss due to transpiration, partially depressed by waxing. Postharvest changes in mechanical properties include softening. Postharvest deterioration of taste and aroma is particularly important in mandarins. Chilling injury is observed most frequently when fruit, previously stored at low temperature for a few weeks, is exposed to ambient temperature. The most common type of chilling injury in citrus is “pitting,” to which grapefruit is particularly susceptible. The most common postharvest pathogens of citrus fruit are fungi and particularly Penicillium digitatum and Penicillium italicum, known as the green and blue molds, respectively. The most commonly applied fungicides are sodium orthophenyl phenate and thiabendazole. Most frequently recommended storage conditions are temperatures of 5–9°C for oranges, 7–12°C for lemons, 9–12°C for grapefruit, 3–9°C for tangerines and mandarins, and 9–12°C for limes, high relative humidity and adequate aeration.

Non-uniform heating and, sometimes runaway heating, have been the major challenges with implementation of this technology. In this study, an experimentally validated computer simulation model was developed to predict the effects of different package geometries, electrode configurations, and use of forced air (60 °C) on improving the heating uniformity of raisins treated with \{RF\} for insect control. Higher temperatures (60–76 °C) were observed in the areas between the edges and corners on the top and bottom layers of the \{RF\} treated raisins held in rectangular and cylinder shaped containers, with lower temperatures (40–52 °C) observed in the central areas of each layer. The heating uniformity was improved by rounding the corners of the containers and reducing sharp edges on the packages, modifying electrode configurations, and applying forced air after \{RF\} heating. These modifications reduced the maximum temperature difference throughout a container of heated raisins to about 5 °C. Approximately 356 min were needed to raise the raisin temperature in a rectangular container from 23 °C to 55–60 °C using only forced air at 60 °C. In contrast, only 6 min of \{RF\} heating followed by 10 min of forced air treatment at 60 °C was needed for a similar filled container to reach a temperature of 55–60 °C. Shortening the electrodes length to 4 cm shorter than the horizontal dimensions of the rectangular containers also improved heating uniformity. This technique can be easily implemented to improve the uniformity of \{RF\} heating in the food industry for the control of insects in packaged dried fruits. Industrial relevance The results in this study provide essential information about the non-uniform heating inside the \{RF\} heated materials packed in containers with sharp areas, edges and corners, such as rectangular and cylindrical shaped containers. Rounding the edges and corners in the containers or bending the top and bottom electrodes is key parameters to control the electrical field inside the \{RF\} system. This technique can be easily implemented to improve the uniformity of \{RF\} heating in the food industry for the control of insects in packaged dried fruits. "

Production of high quality fruits and monitoring postharvest changes during storage and transport are thus primary concerns for exporters to ensure the premium value of fresh mango fruit after distribution. This study aims to demonstrate the applicability of Random Forests (RF) for estimating the internal qualities of mango based on peel colour. Two cultivars, namely Nam Dokmai and Irwin, having different fruit properties and grown in intensively managed orchards in Thailand and Japan, respectively, were used in this study. Postharvest changes in peel colour and fruit quality were observed under three storage conditions with respect to temperature. \{RF\} models were applied to establish a relationship between peel colour and fruit quality, and then tested the applicability based on model accuracy and variable importance computed by the RF. Specifically, this work demonstrates how the variable importance can be used to interpret the model results. The high accuracy and the information retrieved by the \{RF\} models suggest the applicability and practicality as a non-destructive assessment method for the quality of fresh mango fruit. "

This damage can cause considerable postharvest and economic losses, reduce produce quality and result in serious food safety concerns. Understanding the factors influencing susceptibility or resistance of produce to bruising is important in developing strategies for reducing the problem. This review discusses main preharvest factors that could be manipulated by producers prior to harvest in attempts to reduce bruise damage of fresh fruits during postharvest handling. These factors include: (1) genetic (species/genotype); (2) climatic and environmental; (3) seasonal variation; (4) orchard management practices; and (5) effect of fruit properties. A critical discussion of these factors and their relative influence on bruise susceptibility of fresh fruits is presented. Among other factors, orchard management practices such as irrigation and fertilization could be an important strategy to manipulate fruit mechanical strength to enhance resistance to bruising. Future research directions are discussed. "

Pineapple acidity is strongly affected by climatic factors during fruit growth but there is a lack of knowledge about their period of influence. A statistical model was developed to: (i) identify the periods (referred to as “integration periods”) during the flowering–harvest interval during which climatic variables (rainfall, global radiation and temperature) affect titratable acid content (TA) of pineapple fruit at harvest; and (ii) to predict \{TA\} at harvest on Reunion Island. The model was developed in two steps. In Step 1, those integration periods that were best correlated with \{TA\} were identified for each climatic variable. In Step 2, a complete linearized mixed-effect model (GLM) was built to predict \{TA\} based on all candidate variables. Temperature greatly affected \{TA\} in early growth periods, whereas total radiation had a considerable effect in late growth periods. Rainfall greatly affected \{TA\} in both early and late growth periods. In the complete GLM, the climatic variables and the interaction between temperature and rainfall were significantly correlated with \{TA\} at harvest and explained 60% of the variance. Comparison of model predictions and observations from 14 pineapple fields indicated that the model accurately predicted \{TA\} (RRMSE = 0.08). This model should help farmers to select the planting date and flowering induction date in order to optimize \{TA\} in pineapple fruit on Reunion Island. "

The aim of this work was to determine the effect of ethylene on the quality of colored citrus fruit stored under commercial conditions to extend postharvest life, since it protects them from stress causing postharvest disorders such as chilling injury (CI) and non-chilling peel pitting (NCPP). The effect of conditioning mature Navelate and Lane Late sweet oranges (Citrus sinensis L. Osbeck) for 4 days with 2 μL L−1 ethylene at 12 °C, rather than at higher temperatures used for degreening, on the quality of fruit stored at 2 or 12 °C, was examined. The ethylene conditioning (EC) treatment did not increase color but reduced calyx abscission and \{NCPP\} in fruit of both cultivars stored at 12 °C, and also \{CI\} in Navelate fruit at 2 °C. Lane Late fruit did not develop \{CI\} but showed a new disorder in \{EC\} fruit held at 2 °C. This disorder began as scalded areas around the fruit stem end and extended over the fruit surface during storage. \{EC\} had no deleterious effect on the quality of Navelate oranges stored at either 2 or 12 °C. Similar results were found in Lane Late fruit although \{EC\} slightly increased off-flavor perception at 2 °C and the maturity index at 2 and 12 °C. Moreover, \{EC\} slightly increased the content of bioactive flavonoids in the pulp of Navelate fruit but significant differences between control and \{EC\} fruit were only found after prolonged storage at 2 °C. In Lane Late fruit, \{EC\} avoided the initial decrease in flavonoid content found in control samples. Results show, therefore, that \{EC\} at 12 °C may be a tool to extend postharvest life of \{NCPP\} and CI-sensitive oranges, and that the tolerance of citrus cultivars to the combined effect of \{EC\} and non-freezing low temperature (2 °C) should be tested to select the proper storage temperature.

The aim of our research was to highlight in vivo interaction between the number of damaged berries and the conditions for fungus development in relation to \{OTA\} concentration in wine. A survey carried out on the 2005 production from 156 vineyards bordering on the French Mediterranean enabled a link to be made between information on crop management, vineyard characteristics, meteorological data and the \{OTA\} concentration in wine. With humid air conditions during the susceptible berry period of 20 days before harvest, combined with a large number of damaged berries and a temperature conducive to both fungus growth and \{OTA\} production, critical levels of \{OTA\} concentration in wine were observed. Within the range of average daily air temperatures investigated, from 17.2 to 22.8 °C, during the susceptible berry period, 21 °C appeared to be the lower limit below which fungus growth and \{OTA\} production were not sufficient to result in critical levels of \{OTA\} concentration in wine. In our experiment, an average daily air temperature under 21 °C corresponded to an average minimum daily air temperature under 15 °C, below which fungus growth stopped under in vitro conditions. The importance of the berry sugar content before harvest was also demonstrated and our results suggest that the risk of wine contamination by \{OTA\} might be predicted from the number of damaged berries and the berry sugar content, along with climate monitoring.

Compared with black netting, the Pearl netting significantly reduced water loss, decay incidence and titratable acidity, and increased fruit firmness, elasticity, ascorbic acid level and antioxidant activity, but did not change the external quality, except for a decrease in chroma. The effects of the Pearl netting were most pronounced on late-season-harvested fruits. Significant interactions were obtained between the shade netting type and harvest date. Analysis of correlations among the quality traits indicated that increased antioxidant activity and ascorbic acid content were tightly associated with the postharvest fruit quality attributes affected by the Pearl netting. Comparison between climatic parameters under the two netting treatments revealed no significant difference in air temperature and humidity, but the Pearl netting increased not only transmittance of long-waveband light but also light intensity within plant canopy. The findings suggest that the Pearl netting is more effective in maintaining postharvest sweet pepper fruit quality than the traditional black netting, especially at late-season harvests. The effects of the Pearl netting can be related to alteration of antioxidant levels induced by the pre-harvest light environment manipulation. "

abstract = "Abstract Freshly harvested fruits and vegetables (produce) are chilled to extend their shelf life but the chilling process increases opportunities for contamination by pathogenic bacteria carried by water through openings such as stem scars. Using tomato as a representative system, a 3D porous medium transport model is developed. The model simulates the transport of water vapor, liquid water, bacteria, and energy in light of convection–diffusion processes driven by pressure gradients from condensation inside as well as by water concentration gradients between the cooling water and that in the tomato. Results show that increasing the rate of cooling (i.e., creating a higher temperature difference) increases the rate of infiltration due to higher-pressure gradients. A higher temperature differential drives bacteria further into the tomato. A less hydrated tomato will incur deeper and more extensive infiltration. Size, permeability, and diffusivity play a less significant role. The novel mechanistic understanding our study provides should aid in designing safer hydrocooling processes. "

Significant (P ≤ 0.05) differences were observed in fruits treated with \{GA\} 10% and \{CA\} 3% as compared to control. The combined treatment of \{CA\} 3% + \{GA\} 10% significantly alleviated the increase in decay incidence. Furthermore, \{GA\} 10% alone or combined with \{CA\} 3% effectively reduced weight loss, color changes, soluble solid concentration, respiration rate, ethylene production and maintained high firmness, titratable acidity and ascorbic acid. The result of transmission electron microscopy revealed that these treatments also protected the ultrastructure of mitochondria. These results suggest that application of \{GA\} 10% coating combined with \{CA\} 3% might be a simple and effective technique for preserving mango fruit quality during low temperature storage. "

In addition, a set of analyses were carried out using Ar as carrier gas in order to evaluate the influence of the atmosphere (oxidative or inert conditions) on the decomposition of the samples evaluating the reactions of pyrolysis. The release of gases was monitored by Evolved Gas Analysis (EGA) with in-line Fourier Transformed Infrared (FT-IR) analysis. The thermo-chemical reaction was mathematically described through the definition of the main kinetic parameters: activation energy (Ea), pre-exponential factor (ln A) and model and order of reaction (n). The so-called kinetic triplet was calculated through the application of a methodology based on complementary iso-conversional methods. These results will be the initial parameters that will help design the Spouted Bed Reactor and it is envisaged that they will be used in computer simulation software to achieve a better understanding of the process to obtain the optimum operational parameters.

The present work explored the possibility of using radio frequency (RF) heating as a means to increase the internal fruit heating rate in water to control pests. Based on the thermal death kinetics of the Mediterranean fruit fly (Medfly), thermal treatments were designed that could provide quarantine security against fruit flies. The main objective of this research was to study the influence of those \{RF\} heat treatments on the quality of treated fruit. Treated ‘Navel’ and ‘Valencia’ oranges were evaluated for post-harvest quality after 10 days of 4 °C storage. The quality parameters included: weight loss, loss in firmness, color change, total soluble solids, acidity, and change in volatiles. The volatile analysis was done by the SPME-GC/MS technique. The results indicated a significant change in volatile flavor profiles upon \{RF\} heat treatments even when there was no significant difference in the other quality parameters. The reduction in process time due to \{RF\} heating helped in retention of many volatile compounds in comparison with conventional hot water heating. The treatment that raises fruit temperature from 19 to 48 °C by \{RF\} heating in saline water and held then for 15 min in 48 °C hot water would meet the quarantine security without impairing the quality of the treated oranges. However, sensory evaluation for market acceptability of treated oranges should be carried out for complete treatment protocol development. "

However, apple handlers are usually faced with large fruit-to-fruit variability of background colour within a population of fruit. In this study, a stochastic modelling approach was used to describe how the initial fruit-to-fruit variability in the background colour of ‘Jonagold’ apples present at harvest, propagates throughout the postharvest chain. Two hundred and twenty ‘Jonagold’ apple fruit were harvested and stored at 1 °C or 4 °C, under different controlled atmosphere (CA) conditions for 6 months, followed by 2 weeks exposure to shelf-life conditions, during which the background colour and ethylene production of the individual fruit were measured. A kinetic model was developed to describe the postharvest loss of skin greenness, by assuming that the loss was principally due to chlorophyll breakdown, the rate of which was dependent on the endogenous ethylene concentration. Stochastic model parameters were identified, and by treating these parameters as fruit-specific, the model could account for more than 95% of the variability of the data. By treating the stochastic model parameters as random factors, the Monte Carlo method was used to model and describe the propagation of the fruit-to-fruit variability of the background colour within a population of fruit. The model developed in this study might allow better management of variability in quality along the postharvest chain, by predicting how the initial fruit-to-fruit variability within a batch of apples will propagate throughout the postharvest chain, as a function of storage and shelf-life conditions.

The results revealed that mulberry fruit subjected to ozone and precooling treatment had higher levels of titratable acidity and total soluble solids content, better retention in firmness and color, and lower decay rate, respiratory intensity, and polyphenol oxidase activity compared to the control. From the analysis of cell ultrastructure and cell wall components of fruit, ozone and precooling treatments also induced shrinkage of the stomata in the epidermis, inhibited bacteria invasion, reduced water transpiration, and delayed the decomposition of the cell walls and the degradation of epidermal tissues.

Results showed that the physiological responses and quality of fruit were affected by storage condition, with the maximum levels of respiration occurring at higher temperature and extended storage duration. Fruit color and antioxidant capacity varied slightly among storage temperatures, with total soluble solids and titratable acidity decreasing gradually over time at different temperatures. Although storage at 5 °C significantly reduced the total phenolic content of fruit when stored beyond 8 weeks, levels of antioxidant activity in the fruit were not affected. Weight loss was particularly high in fruit stored at 22 °C for 4 weeks, ranging between 20 and 25% for both cultivars. Furthermore, the severity and occurrence of physiological disorders were lower in fruit stored at low temperature but increased with extended storage duration. Considering that fruit stored at 5 °C and 92% \{RH\} had significantly reduced weight loss, low incidence of physiological disorders and best results in maintaining flavor attributes (TSS and TA, TSS:TA ratio), it is recommended that the investigated cultivars be stored at 5 °C and &gt;92% \{RH\} for 8–12 weeks.

To reduce such losses, table grapes are usually treated with conventional fungicides during the season, and cold stored in the presence of sulfur dioxide. However, these applications are not permitted in organic agriculture, and at the same time, there is a growing demand from consumers for fresh fruit free from pesticide residues. The application of essential oils and hypobaric treatments are promising alternatives to sulfur dioxide with minimal environmental impacts and limited concerns about human health risks. The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness for control of postharvest gray mold of table grapes of 24-h exposure to volatiles of essential oils of Rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary), Mentha piperita (peppermint), and Thymus vulgaris (thyme) individually and in combinations with hypobaric treatment at 50 kPa (0.5 atm). Exposure to volatiles of rosemary essential oils under atmospheric pressure and hypobaric conditions reduced by around 65% the incidence and McKinney’s Index of gray mold for table grapes that were then stored at room temperature for 9 d and 5 d, respectively, or that were stored at 4 °C for 7 d and followed by 3 d shelf life at 20 °C. Peppermint essential oils similarly controlled gray mold for grapes stored at room temperature and under hypobaric conditions for 24 h. Panel tasting revealed perception of the essential oils soon after the treatments and 24 h later for grape berries exposed to vapors of rosemary, peppermint, and Lavandula × ibrida (lavender). Then 48 h after treatment, the rosemary and peppermint essential oils were no longer perceived on grapes stored at 4 °C and at 20 °C. Exposure to volatiles of the rosemary and peppermint essential oils alone or in combination with hypobaric treatment might represent an innovative method to control postharvest gray mold of table grapes, although at least 48 h were needed between exposure to volatiles of essential oils and presentation to consumers.

In this study, the effect of low dose gamma irradiation on the post-harvest quality of two varieties of pummelos (Citrus maxima (Burm.) Merr.), an emerging crop of interest in the \{US\} was evaluated. Two varieties of pummelos grown in California were irradiated at the phytosanitary target dose of 150 Gy and a higher dose of 1000 Gy to exaggerate and hence confirm the effects of treatment. The fruit was stored at 12 °C for 3 weeks and at 20 °C for the 4th week to reflect three weeks of sea shipment at the ideal temperature for storage of pummelos and an additional week of retail under ambient conditions. Neither irradiation nor storage affected juice content, organic acids, sugars, peel or pulp color and consumer sensory preference, although numerous volatiles increased in concentration as a result of irradiation treatment. Irradiation caused an immediate reduction in whole fruit and pulp firmness in ‘Chandler’ but not ‘Sarawak’ pummelos at both 150 Gy and 1000 Gy. The quality of irradiated pummelos stored at refrigerated temperature for 3 weeks was similar to untreated pummelos, however, physical handling and exposure to higher temperature resulted in increased peel pitting of irradiated fruit compared to non-treated fruit. The results suggest that irradiation could serve as a potential phytosanitary treatment for Chandler and Sarawak pummelos, provided that the fruit is subjected to minimal handling and not temperature abused.

Analysis of variance showed that storage temperature and containment in microperforated Xtend® bags significantly influenced the nutritional qualities, with significant interaction between temperature and packaging material. Vitamin C, total phenolic and hydrophilic antioxidant contents were not significantly reduced (α = 0.05) at suboptimal storage temperatures of 4 or 1.5 °C in Xtend packaging, compared with those stored at the optimum storage temperature of 7 °C in Xtend® packaging. Aromatic volatiles, which create fruity, spicy, pungent, floral sweet, floral green and bell pepper-like odor notes, were observed. Most of the volatiles decreased in quantity at reduced storage temperatures when Xtend packaging was used. Particularly, 2-isobutyl-3-methoxypyrazine – the source of bell pepper-like aroma notes was found to decrease at lower storage temperatures but the fruits did not lack aroma. Thus quality and aroma of red pepper fruits can be maintained at suboptimal temperatures of 4 or 1.5 °C, which can serve as a quarantine treatment that would simultaneously eliminate Mediterranean fruit fly (Ceratitis capitata).

Listeria monocytogenes is of particular concern as it can multiply even at the low temperatures used to store fresh cut products pre-sale. Current detection methods rely on culturing, which is time consuming and does not provide results in the time frame required. Growth of bacteria on a substrate alters its chemical composition affecting the profile of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted. Use of \{VOCs\} as a detection method has been hampered by lack of sensitivity and robust sample collection methods. Here we use thermal desorption gas chromatography time of flight mass spectrometry (TD-GC-TOF-MS) followed by analysis with PerMANOVA to analyse \{VOC\} profiles. We can discriminate between fresh cut melon cubes inoculated with 6 log CFU/g of L. monocytogenes and uninoculated controls, as well as melon cubes inoculated with &lt;1 log CFU/g of L. monocytogenes stored for 7 days at 4 °C and following equilibration for 6 h at 37 °C.

Some of the edible fruits ripen within a very short period, usually leading to an overabundance of the fruits when harvested. Many of the fruits are consumed fresh, but large quantities of harvested fruits are wasted during peak harvest periods, due to the high temperature and humidity, poor handling, poor storage facilities and microbial infections. Therefore, winemaking from such ripe fruits or their juices is considered as an alternative of utilizing surplus and over-ripe fruits for generating additional revenues for the fruit growers. This review summarizes current knowledge about the usage of fruits other than grapes for winemaking and elaborates their properties; mainly quality, consumption, nutrition, sensory evaluation and health benefits. Hence, production and commercialization of non-grape fruit wines is the basis for the standardization of technologies for reducing post-harvest losses and contributes to the economy of the existing wine industry.

This approach should be applied throughout the year to maintain healthy plants and better soil health. To prevent postharvest losses, we must understand the biological and environmental factors that are responsible for quality deterioration of fruit. Basically, insect pests, microorganism enzymes, temperature, relative humidity, and moisture content are deteriorating the quality of fruit and reduce the shelf life. Most farmers around the world applied traditional insecticides at regular intervals to control insect infestation but there are several alternative methods, for example, orchard sanitation, physical and biological control, trapping and spraying of poison bait, sterile insect techniques, male annihilation techniques, and horticultural ecosystem analysis based integrated pest management of insects along with newer and safest molecules of insecticides, which are economical, ecofriendly, and efficient in control of insect population, as well as optimize yield by preharvest management.

Sorbus fruits were dehydrated in a computer connected parallel air flow type dryer and in a microwave oven dryer. Samples of freshly harvested sorbus fruits were dehydrated under two air temperatures of 50° and 70 °C and at three microwave power levels of PL-1, PL-2 and PL-3. Selected drying air velocity was 0.30 m/s for both temperatures. Sorbus fruits were dehydrated from the initial moisture content of 300 (percentage dry basis) to a final moisture content of 8...10%. During convective drying experiments, product were weighted automatically by the balance per 5...10 minutes. Data were transferred to the computer and processed by a software. During microwave drying, the product were weighted and data recorded manually per 15...60 minutes. The influence of drying method, drying air temperature and microwave power level have also been studied. Hunter L, a, b values system was also used to evaluate changes in total color difference (ΔE) on dried products. The results showed that convective drying air temperature and microwave oven power levels influenced the total drying time, total energy requirement, specific energy requirement and color difference for sorbus fruits. The minimum specific energy requirement were determined as 0.69 kWh/kg and 37.07 kWh/kg for 70 °C and PL-3 respectively. 50° C drying air temperature and PL-1 was found to yield better quality product in terms of color retention of Hunter L, a, b and ΔE. As a result, to reduce drying energy consumption and to keep better color retention, convective drying can be recommended for this application. "

Among other horticultural crops, tomato fruit suffers chilling injury when it is storage under refrigerated conditions. Much effort has been made to understand the mechanisms of generation of this physiologic disturbance, but many aspects need to be clarified yet. Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) cv. “Micro-Tom” is a miniature tomato plant with various properties that make it useful as a model system in plant biology. In this work, the potential of tomato cv. “Micro-Tom” fruit as a model to study chilling injury was investigated. The effect of postharvest chilling was compared on cvs. “Micro-Tom” and “Minitomato”, another variety with fruit of similar size. Green mature fruits cvs. “Micro-Tom” and “Minitomato” were harvested and stored during 4 weeks at 4 °C. It was observed that tomato cv. “Micro-Tom” fruit was clearly tolerant to chilling while tomato cv. “Minitomato” fruit developed severe chilling injury symptoms and avoided ripening. Harvest and chilling altered the length of time between the different ripening stages, the development of red full color and smell. Also, it was shown that harvesting fruits by visual appreciation is a rapid and useful method for distinguishing the different ripening stages during tomato cv. “Micro-Tom” fruit ripening. These results showed that tomato cv. “Micro-Tom” fruit was able to counteract the strain resulting from the imposed chilling stress. Altogether these data indicate that tomato cv. “Micro-Tom” fruit is a good model to study the mechanism of postharvest chilling response and tolerance in tomato. "

The fruit is rich in antioxidants and recommended to be included in the daily diet due to its health benefits such as reduced risk of cardiac disease, anti cancer, and anti viral activities. Maintenance of mango fruit quality during the supply chain depends on many aspects including adequate orchard management practices, harvesting practices, packing operation, postharvest treatments, temperature management, transportation and storage conditions, and ripening at destination. Postharvest losses are high during the supply chain due to harvesting fruit at improper maturity, mechanical damage during the whole chain, sap burn, spongy tissue, lenticels discolouration, fruit softening, decay, chilling injury, and disease and pest damage. The aim of postharvest treatments and management practices in the supply chain is to create suitable conditions or environments to extend the storage life and retain the quality attributes, nutritional and functional compositions. This review summarises the available research findings to retain the overall mango fruit quality and to reduce postharvest losses during supply chain by adopting suitable postharvest novel technologies.

The results show that, for varieties harvested during February, the variety Natura was the best adapted to storage at 4 °C, as its fruits suffered less from chilling injuries, had a lower weight loss, and the levels of metabolites malonyldialdehyde and \{H2O2\} were not as high as in the other varieties. Genetic variation was detected for some of the parameters analysed. The positive correlation among the levels of MDA, H2O2, and chilling injury, as well as the negative correlation among catalase and chilling injury, makes these parameters good indicators of chilling damage in our system.

The 7/8th cooling time of individual clamshells was predicted within less than 3% of the experimental value. In addition, the local performance of the model and its capability to predict the strawberry moisture loss were qualitatively analyzed. The moisture loss was predicted between 73% and 88% of the experimental value. The predicted temperature profile of individual fruits and airflow within clamshells followed the general trends experimentally determined. Finally, the results corroborated that the transport phenomena during force-air cooling applications can be modeled by decoupling the momentum transport from the transport of energy and mass. "

In the present study, the effect of different postharvest temperatures on muscat flavor and the content of aroma volatiles was investigated at 0, 2, 5, and 10 °C for 12 weeks in the berries of ‘Shine Muscat’ (Vitis labruscana Baily × Vitis vinifera Vitis vinifera L.), which has a strong muscat flavor. Furthermore, after 2, 4, and 8 weeks of storage at 0 °C, the grapes were subjected to post-storage conditioning at 10 °C for 14 more days, and changes in the aroma volatile content were investigated. A sensory test showed that after 4 weeks of storage, the muscat flavor obviously decreased at 0 °C, but at 10 °C, the muscat flavor was maintained. Gas chromatography analysis of aroma volatiles showed that the content of linalool, which is one of the causative agents of muscat flavor, dramatically decreased at low temperatures (0, 2, and 5 °C) in comparison with that at 10 °C. During storage, the linalool content was much lower at 0 °C than at 10 °C in both the skin and the flesh. Interestingly, the linalool content, as well as muscat flavor, which decreased during storage at 0 °C, increased after the grapes were subjected to post-storage conditioning at 10 °C. The linalool content of the grape conditioned at 10 °C for 1–14 more days was higher than that of the grape continuously stored at 0 °C. These results indicated that muscat flavor is strongly influenced by postharvest temperature and that low-temperature storage enhances the loss of muscat flavor and the decrease in linalool content, but storage at 10 °C delayed and minimized them. Moreover, these results showed that post-storage conditioning at an increased temperature before consumption would be effective to increase the muscat flavor even after flavor loss during low-temperature storage at 0 °C.

An analysis of the representative colour parameters of this red-violet variety was also determined. The anthocyanin composition was determined using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to diode array detector and mass spectrometry (HPLC–DAD–MS). The contribution of individual anthocyanins to the \{TAC\} value of table grapes was calculated on the basis of their concentration and antioxidant capacity measured as the \{TEAC\} value (slope of the anthocyanin/slope of Trolox). Chromatographic analysis identified six anthocyanins, including pelargonidin 3-glucoside (Pg-3-G), in the skin of Cardinal table grapes. Short-term storage at 0 °C in air had an increasing effect on the concentration of each of the identified anthocyanins. After 3 days at 0 °C, untreated grapes had the highest anthocyanin content (27.55 mg/100 g FW) and displayed the largest \{TAC\} value (52.45 mM TE/100 g FW). Peonidin 3-glucoside (Pn-3-G) was the predominant anthocyanin, and it was mainly responsible for the rise in the calculated \{TAC\} value in untreated grapes. Pn-3-G had a low average \{TEAC\} value (1.73 mM), but its contribution could be explained by the sharp increase in the content of this anthocyanin the first days of storage at 0 °C. In contrast, the Pn-3-G content in grapes at the end of the 3-day \{CO2\} treatment did not change, and both the total anthocyanin content and the calculated \{TAC\} value remained significantly constant in comparison to the levels in pre-stored grapes. In addition \{CO2\} treatment had a positive effect on the amount of Pg-3-G concomitant with a pronounced decline in delphinidin 3-glucoside (Dp-3-G) and smaller decreases in petunidin 3-glucoside (Pt-3-G) and malvidin 3-glucoside (Mv-3-G). These effects of high \{CO2\} levels on the profile of individual anthocyanins were progressively lost when grapes were transferred to air. Indeed, after prolonged low-temperature storage when the colour of the berries become dark violet, similar calculated \{TAC\} values were quantified in untreated grapes and in those exposed to 20% CO2. These data provide new insights about the effect of low temperature and high \{CO2\} levels on the concentration of the individual anthocyanins identified in cardinal table grapes. "

In addition, subcellular location and time-dependent accumulation trends of differentially accumulated proteins associated with fruit quality were analyzed. To understand the relationships between these differentially accumulated proteins and fruit quality changes, composition of organic acids (malic acid, citric acid and quinic acid) and soluble sugars (fructose, glucose and sucrose) were investigated.

Under these stress conditions, plants accumulate \{ABA\} that triggers a response to cope with the adverse environment. In this study, we investigated the implication of \{ABA\} in the acquisition of chilling tolerance in zucchini during fruit postharvest. For that, we have analyzed \{ABA\} biosynthesis and response in fruit of two varieties with different chilling tolerance, ‘Natura’ (cold tolerant) and ‘Sinatra’ (cold sensitive). The results have showed that the biosynthesis of \{ABA\} was induced in ‘Natura’ fruit, with an increase of the abscisic aldehyde oxidase activity (AAO), and consequently an accumulation of \{ABA\} during the first day of exposition to cold. The levels of \{ABA\} showed a significant negative correlation with weight loss and chilling damage, and a positive correlation with firmness. Transcriptional analysis of some genes involved in \{ABA\} signaling and response, such as the \{ABA\} receptors \{PYL1\} and PYL4, the transcription factors AI5L2/ABF3, NAC072/RD26, ATHB7, bHLH112, and the enzymes \{KAT2\} as well as HDA6, a deacetylase involved in histone modification, presented different expression levels between varieties, showing ‘Natura’ the highest expression in most cases at least at short-term storage. Finally, to corroborate the role of \{ABA\} in cold tolerance, 5 mM of sodium tungstate (an inhibitor of \{ABA\} biosynthesis) was applied to ‘Natura’ fruit and 0.5 mM of \{ABA\} was applied to ‘Sinatra’ fruit and their postharvest behaviour at low temperature was followed. The treatment with tungstate induced cold-sensitivity in ‘Natura’ fruit, whereas ABA-treated ‘Sinatra’ fruit improved their quality during the storage at 4 °C. The results obtained point to \{ABA\} as a phytohormone responsible for the acquisition of postharvest cold tolerance. "

Additionally, full slip and clipped Western cantaloupes were equilibrated to 18 °C and then immersed in water at 18 °C containing 6 log CFU/ml of L. monocytogenes (isothermal immersion without temperature differential). Water containing L. monocytogenes infiltrated both full slip and clipped cantaloupes through the stems/stem scars and was then distributed along the vascular system in hypodermal mesocarp reaching the calyx area of the fruit. The current study demonstrated that, under experimental conditions, L. monocytogenes can internalize into cantaloupes during immersion in water contaminated by L. monocytogenes, both in the presence and absence of temperature differential, and that temperature differential moderately enhanced the internalization of L. monocytogenes. The incidence and levels of L. monocytogenes internalized in the middle-mesocarp were significantly affected by harvesting technique but not by cantaloupe cultivar. "

The pattern of stilbene synthase (STS) gene expression and trans-resveratrol levels were also analyzed in grapes during low temperature storage at 0 °C and further shelf-life at 20 °C for 2 days. Our results showed that high \{CO2\} pretreatment was effective for improving appearance of the bunches and maintaining the quality of the berries. In CO2-treated bunches the browning and withering index, the decline in relative water content and the weight loss were also lower than in non-treated ones. The levels of \{STS\} mRNA and the accumulation of trans-resveratrol in CO2-treated grapes were much lower than in the non-treated grapes during low temperature storage. Moreover, the pattern of \{STS\} gene expression and trans-resveratrol content in CO2-treated grapes was consistent with the reduction of natural total decay produced by this pretreatment. This effective non-stressing treatment avoids the induction of trans-resveratrol during low temperature storage until its synthesis is enhanced during shelf-life at 20 °C. "

The antioxidant properties of nectarines were also improved by \{NFT\} storage. The radical scavenging activity, reducing power, antioxidant activity and metal-chelating ability of the pulp were significantly enhanced by \{NFT\} storage at the end of storage.

Both 1-MCP doses were effective in terms of ethylene inhibition during shelf life after cold storage, for both ripening stages. Similarly, lower weight losses, delayed colour changes, reduced softening rate and diminished ripening index were found in 1-MCP treated plums than in controls at both stages of ripeness. Hence, during cold storage and shelf life, the efficacy of 1-MCP on ethylene production, weight loss, pulp firmness and ripening index was dose-dependent, while for colour and respiration rate the dose-dependence was only found during shelf life. The storability of 1-MCP treated plums could be extended up to 4 weeks of cold storage plus 7 days at 20 °C, and only up to 1 week of cold storage plus 7 days at 20 °C for controls. Then, 1-MCP is an effective tool for quality improvement and extension of shelf life in plums, and fruit might be harvested in stage 2 of ripening, at which the most desirable organoleptic attributes had been developed on tree.

They vary strongly with genetic (cultivars) and environmental (climate, soil, and cultural practices together referred to as “terroir”, and vintage) factors. The aim of this work was to determine changes in metabolite fingerprints of grape berry skins of ‘Merlot noir’, ‘Carbernet franc’ or ‘Cabernet Sauvignon’ cultivars harvested in 2002, 2003 and 2004 from five geographical locations in Bordeaux (south-west of France) to better understand the factors influencing the grape berry composition. 1H \{NMR\} spectroscopy was used to determine metabolic profiles of skin extracts of berries harvested at maturity. Before analysis by multivariate statistical methods, spectral data were reduced (sum of intensities over 0.04 ppm spectral domains) and normalized to generate 183 variables describing the entire spectra. Principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares (PLS) chemometric methods were applied to describe sample variability and show clustering of samples. These chemometric methods gave a good separation of samples according to vintages. \{PLS\} allowed us to pinpoint spectral domains corresponding to metabolites contributing to the differences between vintages, including sugars (glucose, fructose and sucrose), organic acids (tartaric, malic, citric and succinic acids), and amino acids (proline, arginine, GABA, valine, alanine, leucine and isoleucine). Conversely, soils classified according to their capacity to provide water to the vines, could not be discriminated by 1H \{NMR\} metabolic fingerprinting of the berries. The vintage effect on grape metabolic profiles prevailed over the soil effect. This emphasizes the fact that a typical vineyard is defined by its most frequent climatic traits such as the seasonal sum of temperatures and water balance. "

Berries were subjectively rated and anthocyanins and phenolic compounds were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to determine storage effects on berry postharvest quality and phenolic compounds. Berries harvested at the shiny black ripeness stage or those stored constantly at 1 °C had lower leakage, decay, and softness and a higher overall rating. ‘Navaho’ fruit had generally better storability compared to the other cultivars. Total anthocyanin content was generally higher in ‘Natchez’ and ‘Navaho’ than in ‘Ouachita’, and increased with storage at 20 °C for 2 d, while shiny black and dull black fruit were similar in anthocyanin content. Cyanidin 3-glucoside was found to represent 87–96% of the total anthocyanin content, and cyanidin 3-rutinoside, cyanidin 3-xyloside, and pelargonidin 3-glucoside were also detected. Total phenolic content increased during storage for all cultivars, especially when berries were stored at 20 °C for 2 d. Hydroxybenzoic acids were the primary phenolic compounds identified in fruit tissues of the three cultivars. Content and proportion of cyanidin 3-xyloside and vanillic acid in ‘Natchez’ were significantly lower than in ‘Ouachita’ or ‘Navaho’ fruit. Results indicate that the fruit of blackberry fruit of these cultivars, when grown organically, could be held with acceptable results when harvested at the shiny black stage of ripeness and stored at 1 °C. Transferring fruit to room temperature for as little as 2 d, even after cold storage, decreased marketability. In contrast, phenolic composition differed among cultivars and generally increased with storage. "

Consequently, great interest is being devoted to develop and optimize alternative postharvest approaches. In this work we tested mild heat treatments for green and red fresh-cut peppers and evaluated their effect on quality maintenance under normal distribution and retail temperatures (4 °C). Pepper sticks (1 × 5 cm) at red and green ripening stages were heat-treated (HT) by immersion in water at 45, 50 or 55 °C (1, 3 or 5 min) and quality maintenance during storage was evaluated. Green peppers were more tolerant to \{HT\} than red fruit. Both green and ripe peppers subjected to hot water dips at 45 °C for 3 min showed lower spoilage than the control. The treatments markedly reduced soft rots (2 and 4 fold for red and green fruit respectively). Hot water dips also prevented shriveling, weight loss, color changes and contributed to maintain lower fruit respiration during storage. The treatments did not alter sugar content, acidity or antioxidant capacity. Despite of the effective control of soft rots only a slight reduction of microbial counts (&lt;1 log \{CFU\} g−1) was found. This suggests that other responses besides biocide effects or microbial wash-off are involved. The treatments delayed pectin solubilization and softening and prevented membrane leakage. Short mild heat treatments (45 °C, 3 min) may be a simple and appealing non-chemical approach to supplement the benefits of low temperature management, extending the shelf life of organic fresh-cut green and red peppers.

The application of \{CHI\} and \{OV\} at sub-inhibitory concentrations (CHI 1/2 MIC + OV 1/4 MIC; \{CHI\} 1/2 MIC + OV 1/2 MIC) inhibited spore germination and caused morphological changes in fungal spores and mycelia, in addition to inhibiting the growth of the assayed fungi strains in artificially infected grapes as well as the autochthonous mycoflora of grapes stored at both room and cold temperature. In general, the application of a coating composed of \{CHI\} and \{OV\} at sub-inhibitory concentrations preserved the quality of grapes as measured by their physical and physicochemical attributes, while some of their sensory attributes improved throughout the assessed storage time.

abstract = "Abstract Citrus is one of the most important fruit crops in Florida and in the world. Diplodia stem-end rot caused by Lasiodiplodia theobromae (synonyms: Botryodiplodia theobromae and Diplodia natalensis) is an economically important postharvest fruit decay that occurs on all types of citrus grown in Florida and other hot, humid tropical and subtropical regions in the world. Postharvest Diplodia stem-end rot develops from latent infections of the fungus established in necrotic tissues of the fruit button (calyx and disk) on citrus trees in groves. After harvest, L. theobromae reactivates, grows and infects the fruit through the natural openings formed between the fruit and button during the button separation upon abscission. Fungal latent infection levels on immature fruit in groves are favored by many factors such as high amounts of deadwood on trees, high temperature, high and frequent rainfall, and less fungicide applied in the grove. Postharvest L. theobromae infection and stem-end rot development can be enhanced by ethylene degreening treatment and excess delay and holding of the fruit before packing and treatment with appropriate postharvest fungicides. The effective control of Diplodia stem-end rot can be achieved through an integrated disease management system with chemical application as the core component during both the preharvest and postharvest stages. This decay control system could include: (1) performing good cultural practices growing citrus trees with minimal amounts of deadwood; (2) delaying harvest for better natural color development or spot picking better colored fruit to minimize the amount of time needed for postharvest degreening treatment; (3) spraying trees with a benzimidazole fungicide (if there is one registered for preharvest use) or drenching fruit with thiabendazole, imazalil or fludioxonil before degreening; (4) minimizing the degreening time and ethylene concentration used; (5) applying fungicides on fruit during packing line processing; and (6) precooling or storing fruit immediately after packing at temperatures of 10°C or less. There are several other citrus postharvest decays that also need to be controlled at the same time as Diplodia stem-end rot. Therefore, the Diplodia stem-end rot control system should be integrated into the overall citrus postharvest decay control system to reduce all citrus postharvest diseases and to protect fresh citrus fruit values.

Strawberries exported to Asia are currently fumigated with methyl bromide for phytosanitary purposes, which exposes strawberries to warm temperatures for several hours and air freight without temperature control, resulting in a shelf life of just a few days in the destination country. Irradiation offers an efficacious alternative to fumigation and can be performed on cold fruit. This study was conducted to compare the quality of strawberries subject to methyl bromide fumigation or irradiation followed by simulated commercial air freight shipment of strawberries to Asian markets and ambient temperature retail display. ‘Amado’ and ‘Marquee’ strawberries were treated with methyl bromide fumigation or gamma irradiation at 400 Gy. The strawberries were wrapped with insulated foil and ice packs for 24 h to mimic commercial air freight conditions then maintained at ambient temperature for two days to simulate retail display. The strawberries lasted only 2 days at ambient temperature, however berries treated with methyl bromide had the highest severity of decay. Irradiated berries were an average of 20% softer than fumigated strawberries and 23% softer than control fruit, however, consumer sensory panels showed no difference in liking for irradiated, fumigated, or control strawberries. Titratable acidity, soluble solids content, color values, and ascorbic acid content were unchanged due to treatments. The marketability of irradiated strawberries was similar to the control and better than the fumigated berries, thus, irradiation at 400 Gy could serve as a viable alternative to methyl bromide fumigation for export of air freighted strawberries.

In the present work, the levels of twelve transcripts encoding proteins involved in cell wall metabolism, as well as the differential extracellular proteome, were examined after a post-harvest heat treatment (HT; 39 °C for 3 days) of “Dixiland” peach fruit. A typical softening behaviour, in correlation with an increase in 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid oxidase-1 (PpACO1), was observed for peach maintained at 20 °C for 3 days (R3). Six transcripts encoding proteins involved in cell wall metabolism significantly increased in \{R3\} with respect to peach at harvest, while six showed no modification or even decreased. In contrast, after HT, fruit maintained their firmness, exhibiting low PpACO1 level and significant lower levels of the twelve cell wall-modifying genes than in R3. Differential proteomic analysis of apoplastic proteins during softening and after \{HT\} revealed a significant decrease of \{DUF642\} proteins after HT; as well as an increase of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPC) after softening. The presence of \{GAPC\} in the peach extracellular matrix was further confirmed by in situ immunolocalization and transient expression in tomato fruit. Though further studies are required to establish the function of \{DUF642\} and \{GAPC\} in the apoplast, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of the events during peach softening and after \{HT\} with a focus on this key compartment.

Strawberry plants were sprayed with 2, 4 and 6 g l−1, chitosan solutions as the fruit were turning red. A second spray was performed after 10 days. Fruit were picked 5 and 10 days after each spray. Harvested fruit from chitosan sprayed plants were challenged with Botrytis cinerea. Chitosan sprays significantly reduced post-harvest fungal rot and maintained the keeping quality of the fruit compared with control. The incidence of decay decreased with increased chitosan concentration and increased with storage period and temperature. The second spray of chitosan extended the protective effect against decay of fruit from subsequent picks. Fruit from chitosan sprayed plants were firmer and ripened at a slower rate as indicated by anthocyanin content and titratable acidity than berries from non-treated plants. Chitosan sprays were not phytotoxic at all the concentrations tested. Chitosan sprays at 6 g l−1 concentration performed twice, 10 days apart, protected the fruit from decay and kept the fruit quality at an acceptable level throughout the storage period of 4 weeks in fruit stored at 3°C. The protective effect of chitosan sprays was more pronounced for fruit from pick 1 than pick 2. Kinetic data on decay and ripening characteristics provided quantitative evidence that chitosan compensates for higher storage temperature and protects against deterioration of lower quality fruit from the second harvest.

Photoselective nets influenced the photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) transmitted through the canopy, with white nets allowing significantly higher radiation to penetrate than red and black nets at all shade levels. After one year of treatment, the rate of flower bud development decreased linearly as % \{PAR\} increased, but the total number of flower buds per cane and terminal shoots increased gradually as light levels increased, reaching an asymptote at 50% PAR. The percentage of mature fruit on a particular date was higher in the control plants and decreased as the % \{PAR\} was reduced. The harvest delay was maximum at the lowest light level (20%) and decreased exponentially with increasing % PAR. Fruit soluble solids increased linearly (r2 = 0.86; P &lt; 0.0001) and fruit water content decreased linearly (r2 = 0.88; P &lt; 0.0001) as % \{PAR\} increased. Fruit yield showed a positive, curvilinear relationship with % \{PAR\} and reached an asymptote at 50% PAR. The interaction between color and shade was not significant. However, fruit quality (fruit weight, soluble solid and firmness) showed significant color × shade and color × harvest time (fruit weight, soluble solids and titratable acidity) interactions. Our results indicate that placing red and white nets over mature plants at intermediate shade levels (40–60% PAR) provide a harvest delay without detrimental effects on return bloom, yield or fruit quality.

The present study revealed that the excellent semi-permeable film of chitosan/nano-silica markedly extended shelf life, reduced browning index, retarded weight loss and inhibited the increase of malondialdehyde amount and polyphenoloxidase activity in fresh longan fruit. In addition, the peroxidase activity of longan fruit coated with hybrid film was lower than that in other treatment fruits. Decreases in the contents of total soluble solids, titratable acidity and ascorbic acid were also significantly inhibited by hybrid films. These data indicated that the chitosan/nano-silica coating might provide an attractive alternative to improve preservation quality of fresh longan fruits during extended storage. "

abstract = "Abstract Low temperature storage has been the main strategy to increase the shelf life of fruits and vegetables by reducing the rate of respiration and minimizing fungal disease growth. However, tropical and subtropical fruits and vegetables stored below 10–12 °C develop chilling injury (CI) following storage beyond the \{CI\} threshold. \{CI\} as a physiological disorder greatly reduces fruits and vegetables quality and frequently renders the product not saleable. The increasing demand for consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables, along with restriction on the use of synthetic chemicals to reduce CI, has encouraged scientific research to develop new technologies based on natural product such as salicylates and jasmonates. Membrane damage and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production are multifarious adverse effects of chilling as oxidative stress in sensitive fruits and vegetables. Chilling alleviating in fruits and vegetables treated with salicylates and jasmonates could be attributed to (1) Enhancing membrane integrity by reducing phospholipase D and C (PLD and PLC) and lipoxygenase (LOX) enzymes activities, enhancing unsaturated fatty acids/saturated fatty acids (unSFA/SFA) ratio probably through increase of fatty acid desaturases (FAD) gene expression and maintaining energy status, \{ATP\} and adenylate energy charge (AEC). (2) Enhancing heat shock proteins (HSPs) gene expression and accumulation. (3) Enhancing antioxidant system activity. (4) Enhancing arginine pathways which led to accumulation of signaling molecules with pivotal roles in improving chilling tolerance such as polyamines, nitric oxide, proline and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). (5) Activation of C-repeat binding factor (CBF) pathway and (6) alteration in phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) and polyphenol oxidase (PPO) enzymes activities. In the present review, we have focused on impacts of exogenous salicylates and jasmonates treatments on postharvest chilling tolerance and mechanisms employed by these safe signaling molecules in fruits, vegetables and cut flowers have also been discussed.

On average 75 ± 2% of the total airflow forced through the system bypassed the clamshells, and 46 ± 5% of the flow rate forced through clamshells bypassed the strawberries. After 1 h of cooling, the average-fruit-temperature per clamshell ranged from 2.4 °C to 8.3 °C between the first and last clamshells along the main flow direction. Within these clamshells, the maximum differences in the volume-average temperature of individual fruits reached 3.5 °C and 5.1 °C, respectively. The results show the potential use of this numerical approach as a design tool to optimize the forced-air cooling process of horticultural products. "

These attributes have increased consumer demand for produce of this type. The commercial success of tropical and subtropical fruits worldwide has favored the development of postharvest technologies and handling techniques for these fruits, especially in developed countries. Some adequate postharvest technologies have now been adopted in developing countries, where most tropical and subtropical fruits are produced and where postharvest technologies were virtually non-existent for many years in the past. For most of these products there have been advances in techniques for harvesting, packing, selection and grading, quality evaluation, transportation (by land, rail, sea and air) and control of storage conditions (temperature, humidity and atmospheric composition) and control of postharvest physiological disorder, insects and microbiological decay. There have also been improvements in methods of packaging, storage and processing. However, in some cases the best methods are not used and need to be made available to stakeholders, especially in developing countries. This chapter describes postharvest technologies and handling practices to maintain the quality of tropical and subtropical fruits. "

Because the loss factor of insect pests, Indian meal moth (Plodia interpunctella) and navel orangeworm (Amyelois transitella), is several times (26–36) greater than that of dried fruits, \{RF\} treatment in particular has great potential for insect disinfection. In this study, the dielectric properties of raisins, dates, apricots, figs, and prunes with water contents of 15–30.2 g/100 g, were determined between 10 and 1800 \{MHz\} over a range of 20–60 °C. The dielectric constant and loss factor of all samples decreased with increasing frequency, but increased with increasing temperature at each frequency. The loss factor of all samples increased with increasing water contents/water activity (0.5–0.7). The penetration depths (dps) of \{RF\} energy in all samples decreased with increasing frequency and temperature. The deep dp (28.4–103.7 cm) at 27 \{MHz\} indicates the potential for developing continuous and large-scale \{RF\} treatments for postharvest insect control in dried fruits. "

At harvest time, fruit were graded in three categories according to the \{IAD\} index (index of absorbance difference = \{A670\} − A720) based on Vis spectroscopy. Physicochemical parameters (soluble solids concentration, titratable acidity and flesh firmness) were measured for the three maturity categories at harvest time and after up to 49 days of storage at 20, 10, 4 or −1 °C. Consumer satisfaction and sensory attributes were also measured on fruit from all three categories at harvest time, as well as on fruit from the intermediate maturity class after storage at the different tested temperatures for up to 49 days. At harvest time, consumer's satisfaction increased significantly with maturity stage at harvest, mainly due to an upper sweetness and flavour perception and higher \{SSC\} value detected in the most mature class. For short storage periods, ‘Big Top®’ nectarines kept at 20 °C received the highest scores for peach flavour intensity and overall acceptance. For longer storage periods, no significant differences among temperatures were observed on sensory quality or consumer satisfaction, except for fruit stored for the longest period (7 weeks), for which higher consumer acceptance was found for fruit stored at −1 °C than at 4 °C. Results also suggested that higher acceptance scores were associated mainly to more intense perception of flavour. "

The anoxia exposure delayed the increase in total sugar content and enhanced total ascorbic acid content during storage. The half-cut pineapple fruit showed that the anoxia exposure completely inhibited internal transparency of the flesh tissue adjacent to core during the storage.

NFT-grown fruits showed darker and greener skin color (higher hue angle and lower lightness) compared with perlite-grown fruit, irrespective of the season considered. During the winter season, the plant transpiration rate was 30% higher in perlite than in \{NFT\} culture, which correlates with higher differences in G* and 40% additional yield in perlite. However, in spring G* was not sensitive enough to discriminate between the two hydroponic systems. In general, fruit quality at harvest in spring was lower than during the winter, due to flesh whitening, higher longitudinal and equatorial calibers, and slightly higher pH, as well as worse epidermal color coordinates (ranging from the dark and dull green color typical of winter fruit to light and a vivid green-yellow color). During the spring season, NFT-grown fruit were less acid than perlite-grown fruit with no apparent correlation with the climatic conditions or fruit nutrition. "

The broad range of conditions under which trees are grown, particularly with regard to climate, soil and agronomical management, can influence this ripening variability. The aims of this study were (i) to determine the variability in fruit ripening among ‘Hass’ avocado grown under different conditions in Chile and (ii) to understand the postharvest fruit-ripening behavior of ‘Hass’ avocado due to the combined effect of several preharvest variables. Preharvest variables were evaluated at 42 experimental sites in Chile during three consecutive seasons. In addition, avocados with over 21% dry matter were collected at each site during each season and stored for 35 d at 5 °C under normal atmospheric conditions before being ripened at 20 °C. Indicators of ripening behavior, such as the softening rate (SOFTRATE), change in peel color (COLO35) and days at 20 °C necessary to reach the ready-to-eat stage (RTE35), were evaluated. As expected, high fruit variability in terms of ripening behavior was observed among the experimental sites and seasons. Multivariate analysis showed that the seasonal mean minimum air temperature, seasonal degree-days, trunk diameter and fruit firmness at harvest had a proportional relationship with postharvest \{SOFTRATE\} and \{COLOR35\} during storage and a significant inverse relationship with RTE35. Conversely, the leaf area index, number of plants per hectare, and irrigation management at the bloom stage had a proportional relationship with \{RTE35\} and an inverse relationship with \{SOFTRATE\} and COLOR35. Moreover, all of the three postharvest ripening behavior indicators were significantly (p &lt; 0.05) estimated by predictive models considering preharvest variables. Therefore, attempting to predict postharvest behavior by considering only a single preharvest variable could be a misleading simplification of reality because several factors, including climate/environmental, agronomic management and physiological variables, influence the ripening behavior of ‘Hass’ avocado fruit.

On the contrary, the effect of the drying air velocity on the total drying time was found less. The minimum and the maximum energy requirement for drying of cornelian cherry fruits were also determined as 11.57 kW h/kg and 39.55 kW h/kg for 70 °C, 0.3 m/s and 50 °C, 0.9 m/s, respectively. As a result, to reduce drying energy consumption, it can be recommended that the drying air velocity must not be more than 0.3 m/s for all different temperatures and the most ideal temperature was found 70 °C for this application.

abstract = "Abstract Hedgerow systems, that have been established in various crops to facilitate mechanical harvesting to reduce costs and more rapid management, are a recent innovation in olive production. They were introduced two decades ago after the crop was grown for centuries as open trees in low-density orchards. The review reveals that N–S oriented hedgerows are the most common and are promoted because each side receives equal daily irradiance under both sunny and cloudy conditions. Conventional wisdom concludes that this leads to higher yield. Plantings away from N–S are justified as adaptations to shape of terrain to achieve more efficient use of land, or to avoid hazards from soil erosion, frost or waterlogging. A central question asks if row orientation could be a design strategy to achieve advantages in management, water use, production and quality, and if so under what combinations of hedgerow dimensions and environmental conditions? The review analyses existing information on the impact of row orientation on quantity and pattern of irradiance on hedgerow surfaces for a wide range of latitudes and structures. The consequent influences on photosynthesis, transpiration and temperature are discussed in relation to hedgerow management, productivity and quality. A summary of 11 studies in various hedgerow crops established that N–S out-yielded E–W by ∼20% in eight cases, while E–W out-yielded N–S in two. There are also reports of advantages and disadvantages to fruit quality, seemingly mediated by responses to higher irradiance and temperature on sunlit hedgerow walls. The evergreen growth habit of olive, together with biannual reproductive cycle and the long period of fruit growth, suggest, among these examples, a potential for a different response to other horticultural crops. E–W or intermediate orientations could be a design tool to manipulate canopy microclimate in temperature and water limited. Testing this hypothesis will require improve the definition of hedgerow foliage structure including porosity, the consequent hedgerow microclimate and its impact on vegetative and reproductive processes that would be aided by development and application of models of hedgerow energy and water exchanges and associated crop responses.

In this work we evaluated the effect of UV-C treatments on quality retention of fresh-cut red peppers. To select the most suitable treatment condition red peppers sticks (5 × 1 cm) were UV-C irradiated (1.5; 3; 5; 6; 10 and 20 kJ m−2) in the inner (I), outer (O) or both fruit surfaces (I + O). UV-C treatments with 10 kJ m−2 I + O were the most effective to reduce spoilage and were used for further evaluations. The selected treatment caused no alterations in sugars, color, acidity or antioxidant capacity and markedly reduced decay, weight loss, softening and pectin solubilization. UV-treated fruit also showed lower respiration rate and electrolyte leakage, indicating improved quality maintenance. UV-C exposure did not exert large direct germicide effects. Instead, histochemical analyses showed that the treatments elicited the superficial accumulation of hydroxycinnamic acid-derivatives (OH-CinAD). Overall, results show that UV-C treatments (10 kJ m−2 I + O) delay pectin solubilization and induce surface accumulation of phenolics and could be useful to complement low temperature storage and extend the shelf life of fresh-cut red peppers.

Mature green lime fruit were treated with water at ambient temperature (control) or with hot water at 50 °C for 3 and 5 min and then kept at 25 °C in darkness. The results showed that hot water treatment at 50 °C for 5 min efficiently delayed the decrease of hue angle values and the contents of Chl a. Activities of Chl-degrading enzymes including chlorophyllase, Chl-degrading peroxidase and pheophytinase as well as Mg-dechelation activity in lime fruit were reduced by hot water treatments. This reduction was more pronounced in fruit treated by hot water for 5 min than in those treated for 3 min. Moreover, heat treatments prolonged storage life by 5 days in fruit treated for 3 min and by 10 days in fruit treated for 5 min. Hot water treatment at 50 °C for 5 min maintained the highest total acidity and delayed the increase of total soluble solids contents during storage. Respiration rate and ethylene production were also reduced by the heat treatments. In conclusion, these results suggest that hot water treatment at 50 °C for 5 min could be a useful method to delay Chl degradation and to maintain postharvest quality in mature green lime during storage at 25 °C.

This has ensured that they have an adequate postharvest life. They are delicate and susceptible to disease, and comprehensive systems have been developed to address these challenges. However, there remains the fact that some of these technologies may have deleterious effects of the environment that represent challenges to sustaining current systems. "

The fruit is usually harvested in its mature-green stage of maturity, using skin colour, titratable acidity and fruit firmness as harvest indices. The fruit is very susceptible to mechanical damage, dehydration and shrivelling, anthracnose rot, softening and chilling injury at temperatures below 12 °C. Postharvest treatments such as modified atmosphere packaging, intermittent warming, 1-methylcyclopropene and hot water dips, and use of adequate packaging may extend its shelf life up to two weeks at 12 °C. The fruit is used fresh and processed (juices, frozen pulps, jams, sweets). This chapter describes basic recommendations for postharvest handling and maintaining quality, and suggests future research directions. "

abstract = "Abstract Fresh fruits and vegetables, destined to be eaten raw or minimally processed only, harbor the risk of conveying pathogenic microorganisms. Factors such as weather conditions, which favor survival or growth of microorganisms, and improper handling during cultivation or in the postharvest chain, can contribute to outbreaks of food-borne illness. Application of chemical sanitizers or physical treatments often shows a limited efficiency or does not meet consumer acceptance. Availability of gentle and effective techniques for disinfection of fresh produce, therefore, is highly desirable. Non-thermal gas plasma (NTP) treatment is a promising novel technique to reduce the microbial load on fresh fruits and vegetables. However, knowledge on practical applicability of \{NTP\} for fresh fruits and vegetables is very limited. In this study, chlorophyll fluorescence imaging (CFI) was used to elucidate suitable process parameters for application of an atmospheric pressure plasma-jet (kINPen 09, \{INP\} Greifswald, Germany) on corn salad, a perishable leafy green. Keeping a distance of 17 mm to the plasma-jet, corn salad leaves could be treated for up to 60 s at a fixed power (8 W) and 5 L min− 1 of argon mixed with 0.1% oxygen. Surface temperature on leaves did never exceed 35.2 °C. Antibacterial tests were performed on corn salad, cucumber, apple, and tomato and achieved an inactivation of artificially inoculated Escherichia coli \{DSM\} 1116 of 4.1 ± 1.2, 4.7 ± 0.4, 4.7 ± 0, and 3.3 ± 0.9 log units, respectively, after 60 s treatment time. Additional tests with a dielectric barrier discharge plasma and indirect plasma treatment within a remote exposure reactor, fed by a microwave induced plasma torch, did not result in equivalent levels of quality retention as observed using the plasma-jet. Industrial relevance Development of gentle non-thermal disinfection methods aims to provide the industry with new tools to actively improve the microbial status of fresh produce beyond the preventive benefits of good hygiene practices and the limited efficacy of post-harvest washing. The presented study shows how cold plasma can be applied to heat-sensitive lettuce leaves without detrimental effects to product quality. The additional microbiological tests offer insights into the antibacterial capacity of cold plasma on different produce surfaces. The results contribute to prompt the development of appropriate large-scale plasma sources to establish a new plasma-based sanitation technique for fresh fruits and vegetables, which should also be implementable into running process lines.

A water reservoir linked to the cooler at the top through a flexible pipe supplied water to fill the gap, thus keeping the coconut fibre continuously wet. Results of the transient performance tests revealed that the cooler storage chamber temperature depression from ambient air temperature varied over 0.1–12 °C. Ambient air temperatures during the test periods ranged over 22–38 °C. The results also illustrate superior performance of the cooler over open air preservation of vegetables soon after harvest during the diurnal operations. Thus, the evaporative cooler has prospects for use for short term preservation of vegetables and fruits soon after harvest. "

The production and quality of fresh fruit and vegetable crops can be directly and indirectly affected by exposure to high temperatures and elevated levels of carbon dioxide and ozone. The rise in atmospheric \{CO2\} levels due to global climate change and horticultural practices has both direct and indirect effects on secondary metabolite synthesis in plants. Temperature increase affects photosynthesis directly, causing alterations in sugars, organic acids, flavonoid contents, firmness, and antioxidant activity. Rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels persistently affected post-harvest quality causing sugar content reduction in potatoes and tuber malformation incidence of common scab. Elevated atmospheric ozone can result in the decline of the photosynthetic rate, growth, biomass accumulation, increment in vitamin C content, and potential reduction in volatile ester emissions in strawberries. Tomatoes exposed to ozone concentrations ranging from 0.005 to 1.0 μmol/mol have resulted in a transient increment in β-carotene, lutein, and lycopene contents. Regardless of global climate changes, new cultivation and processing techniques are required in order to produce sufficient food supplies to meet the basic nutrient requirements of the growing human population.

To meet this goal, the application of plasma processed air (PPA) offers a promising “gentle” alternative to traditional methods, such as pasteurization or the addition of anti-browning compounds. Using ambient air as process gas instead of an expensive noble gas, such as argon, exhibits a substantial improvement for the development of large-scale plasmas at ambient pressure and allows the indirect treatment of larger goods within a remote exposure reactor. In this study the ability of \{PPA\} to inactivate \{PPO\} and \{POD\} in complex food matrices and its impact on quality parameters, such as color, texture and cell integrity directly after freshly cutting and during storage of warm air dried and freeze dried produce was evaluated. The study evidently shows that \{PPA\} processing is capable of reducing the activity of \{PPO\} and \{POD\} in the freshly cut tissue from both apple and potato. Following exposure to \{PPA\} for 10 min the \{PPO\} activity was reduced by about 62% and 77% in fresh cut apple and potato tissue, respectively. POD, as the more temperature-stable enzyme, was even less stable upon \{PPA\} treatment for 10 min and was reduced by about 65% and 89% in fresh cut apple and potato tissue, respectively. Blackening of the potato tissue could be completely prevented by plasma treatment while a browning different from the habitual nature of enzymatic browning occurred upon exposure of the apple tissue to PPA. In both cases, the pH value on the tissue surface dropped to 1.5 while cell integrity and dry matter content were not significantly affected. Industrial relevance The quality and shelf life of freshly cut and dried fruits and vegetables greatly depend on the activity of naturally occurring enzymes which catalyze browning reactions at cut surfaces. This study shows that the application of PPA, as a promising nonthermal “pasteurization” technology, enables the inactivation of \{PPO\} and \{POD\} in complex food matrices. It further describes the impact of the \{PPA\} treatment on quality parameters of the freshly cut tissue from apple and potato and goes beyond on evaluating color, texture and enzyme activity in warm air dried and freeze dried tissue over a storage time of three weeks. The results contribute to the understanding and product-specificity of PPA-induced effects on quality and shelf life of fresh cut and dried fruit and vegetable produce and could be a basis for a possible industrial implementation.

The results showed that low temperature (5°C) strongly inhibited the reduction of firmness and the increase in respiration rate. During storage at ambient temperature (20°C), \{ROS\} had a cumulative process while malondialdehye (MDA) content continued to increase in associated with enhanced membrane lipid peroxidation. Lipoxygenase (LOX) activity was strongly inhibited under the low temperature condition. The activities of succinic dehydrogenase (SDH), cytochrome C oxidase (CCO), and Ca2+-ATPase declined to a certain extent at ambient temperature, while they showed higher activities at low temperature, which may be related to lower membrane lipid peroxidation at low temperature. Higher Ca2+ content at ambient temperature may be responsible for impairment of mitochondrial function, thus, leading to fruit senescence. The results showed that under low temperature condition, the low accumulation of \{ROS\} and the low level of membrane lipid peroxidation could maintain the function of mitochondria that would help to delay the senescence of peach fruits. These suggested a close relationship existed between \{ROS\} metabolism and mitochondrial respiration. It can be inferred that the low temperature helps to delay senescence of peach fruits via suppression of \{ROS\} and related enzymes, maintain better homeostasis of Ca2+ in mitochondria and thus better mitochondrial functions.

It was previously demonstrated that scald is preceded by a metabolomic shift that results in altered levels of various classes of triterpenoids, including metabolites with mass spectral features similar to β-sitosterol. In this study, a key class of phytosterol metabolites was identified. Changes in peel tissue levels of conjugates of β-sitosterol and campesterol, including acylated steryl glycosides (ASG), steryl glycosides (SG) and steryl esters (SE), as well as free sterols (FS), were determined during the period of scald development. Responses to pre-storage treatment with the ethylene action inhibitor, 1-methylcyclopropene, or an antioxidant (diphenylamine), rapid temperature elevation, and cold acclimation using intermittent warming treatments were evaluated. Diphenylamine, 1-MCP, and intermittent warming all reduced or prevented scald development. \{ASG\} levels increased and \{SE\} levels decreased in untreated control fruit during storage. Removing fruit from cold storage to ambient temperature induced rapid shifts in \{ASG\} and \{SE\} fatty acyl moieties from unsaturated to saturated. \{FS\} and \{SG\} levels remained relatively stable during storage but \{SG\} levels increased following a temperature increase after storage. ASG, SE, and \{SG\} levels did not increase during 6 months cold storage in fruit subjected to intermittent warming treatment. Overall, the results show that apple peel phytosteryl conjugate metabolism is influenced by storage duration, oxidative stress, ethylene action/ripening, and storage temperature. "

However, this application method can increase solute concentrations, thereby increasing salinity and raising the electrical conductivity (EC) of the substrate when the nutrients are applied at supra-optimal levels. This can profoundly affect plant photosynthetic capacity and growth. We undertook an investigation to determine: (i) if reduced papaya growth due to salinity is caused by a possible decrease in osmotic potential, a nutrient imbalance, or both, (ii) the sensitivity of stomata of two papaya genotypes to increased EC, and (iii) if increased \{EC\} is detrimental to papaya photochemical capacity. Two different papaya genotypes (Sunrise Golden and Uenf-Caliman 01 hybrid) were fertilized with a nutrient solution with different EC: 1.0, 1.6, 2.2, 2.8 or 3.4 deciSiemens per meter (dS m−1). We found that (i) reduced growth was likely caused by a decrease in osmotic potential of the substrate. Nutrient imbalances were not present and did not account for growth reductions of either genotype under elevated EC, (ii) both genotypes are very sensitive to stomatal effects in response to increased EC, and (iii) an increase in \{EC\} up to 3.4 dS m−1 did not negatively affect the photochemical capacity of either genotype. However, there may have been non-stomatal effects at the Calvin cycle enzyme level. The results of this study show the importance of considering salinity as a relevant abiotic condition for papaya plantations and provide a basis for further field experiments to evaluate effects of high solute concentrations on yield and quality of papaya fruit.

The aim of this study was to define a procedure for disinfesting dates using Radio Frequency (RF) heating. \{RF\} treatments were carried out on dates of the semi-dry Siwi variety, artificially infested with the larvae, pupae and adults of the dried fruit beetle, Carpophilus hemipterus. A pilot-scale radio frequency instrument with 3.5 kW nominal maximum power and a frequency of 27.12 MHz was used to perform the experiments. The internal temperature of the dates was measured during irradiation. An insect mortality assessment was carried out both at the end of \{RF\} treatment and on the following days. The effects of a 4-, 5- and 6-min RF treatment on different stages of C. hemipterus were evaluated, finding that a 6-min exposure ensured mortality of the larvae, pupae and adults of the pest. No significant alterations in moisture content or colour of the treated dates were evident. \{RF\} treatment appeared to be a viable technique for the disinfestation of dates, due to the short treatment time together with the possibility of continuous processing.

Due to the increase of commercial noni fruit products in the global market, an extensive phytochemical comparison of noni fruits and their juice products seems imperative to understand their internal quality. To this end, we developed an \{HPLC\} method, established phytochemical fingerprints, and quantitatively compared the characteristic components in 7 noni fruits and 13 commercial fruit juices originating from the Caribbean, Central America, the Central and South Pacific, and Asia. The results showed that scopoletin, rutin, quercetin, and 5,15-dimethylmorindol were detected in all the samples, although at varying concentrations. Together, these components could be used as a reference for identification and authentication of raw noni fruits and their commercial products. Meanwhile, the variation in phytochemical content in noni fruits and juices may be attributed to the diversity of geographical environments (soil, sunlight, temperature, precipitation, etc.) and post-growth factors (harvesting, storage, transportation, manufacturing processes, formulation, etc.). Further, the variation may also suggest different toxicological and pharmacological profiles. As such, scientific data of efficacy and safety conducted on one noni fruit or juice may not be applicable to all others, including those from the same origins. "

However, the use of chemicals to control postharvest diseases is a public concern with increasing consumer awareness of the dangers associated with the consumption of fungicide-treated commodities. Synthetic fungicides are well-known for their hazardous effects on human health and potential contamination to the environment. Moreover, pathogens are noted to have developed resistance to these chemicals because of their continuous use and abuse. Scope and approach This review focused on the efficacies, potentials and developmental trends of microbial antagonists in the control and biodegradation of OTA-producing fungi in grapes and wine. It outlined the steps and challenges in the development of bioproducts. It also recounted the successes and developments of biocontrol products to date. Key findings and conclusions \{OTA\} production in grapes is caused by the genera Aspergillus and Penicillium, with the species Aspergillus carbanarius as the dominant cause across the globe. The prevalence of OTA-producing fungi in grape vineyards are influenced by temperature, water activity (aw), pH, relative humidity and type of cultivar. Biological control agents (BCAs) have proved successful to control and/or degrade OTA-producing fungi, among which antagonistic yeasts play the leading role. In addition, biocontrol products such as BioSave, Yieldplus, Serenade and Aspire have been developed. Preharvest application is acknowledged to be the best for grapes even a day before harvest because postharvest treatment affects the bloom of the grapes. "

Extensive research has been done in this research area for many decades. Oxygen, CO2, and N2, are most often used in MAP. The recommended percentage of \{O2\} in a modified atmosphere for fruits and vegetables for both safety and quality falls between 1 and 5%. Although other gases such as nitrous and nitric oxides, sulphur dioxide, ethylene, chlorine, as well as ozone and propylene oxide have also been investigated, they have not been applied commercially due to safety, regulatory, and cost considerations. Successful control of both product respiration and ethylene production and perception by \{MAP\} can result in a fruit or vegetable product of high organoleptic quality; however, control of these processes is dependent on temperature control.

The relationship between moisture content and shrinkage in terms of volume and area reduction during drying was satisfactorily explained by a linear model. The results demonstrated that the prediction of papaya shrinkage during drying from top and total surface areas of the sample was possible, but can potentially be improved. Multivariate correlations of computer vision parameters and optical scattering properties showed the enhanced performance for shrinkage prediction. This multi-sensor approach could possibly be applied as a fast, accurate and non-invasive technique for in-line quality control to monitor shrinkage in the production of dried fruits. "

The experiments were carried out by comparing the traditional dipping of fruit with an innovative pilot plant process, designated “thin film” (TF), which is designed to reduce fungicide/water mixture concentration.

Persistence of dormancy after harvest can negatively affect this aspect of seed quality, and seed lots with some degree of dormancy cannot be commercialized. Seed dormancy intensity and duration can vary greatly among sunflower genotypes, but it is also subject to strong interactions with the maternal environment. In this paper we report results of investigations into the effect of temperature during sunflower fruit development on the level of dormancy after harvest. After conducting controlled (greenhouse) and field experiments (sowing dates and plastic tents), we found that higher temperatures during later stages of achene development significantly increased the level of dormancy at harvest and its persistence during storage. The impact of the maternal (thermal) environment on embryo and coat-imposed dormancy was also investigated. Results showed that although maturation under warmer environments reduced embryo dormancy, this effect was overcompensated for by the enhancement of inhibition imposed by the pericarp and the seed coat. In addition, the results obtained suggest that observed changes in dormancy in response to the maternal environment could be at least partially explained by changes in achene and/or embryo sensitivity to ABA. Results presented here should be useful when choosing a proper environment for the production of hybrid sunflower seed of high quality, avoiding high temperatures during later stages of fruit development.

The temperature during fruit ripening conditions berries color intensity. In the main viticulture region of Malbec and Bonarda a 2–3 °C increase in temperature has been predicted for the upcoming years as consequence of the global climate change. In the present study, this predicted temperature raise was simulated under field-crop conditions, and its effect on anthocyanin pigmentation in berries of Malbec and Bonarda was monitored by \{HPLC\} analysis throughout the ripening process, in two growing seasons. Additionally, expression levels of regulatory (MYBA1 and MYB4) and structural (UFGT and Vv3AT) anthocyanin genes were monitored in Malbec berry skins. Although cultivar-dependent time-course variation was observed for total anthocyanin content, in general, the berries of both cultivars grown under high temperature (HT) conditions had significantly lower total anthocyanins (∼28–41% reduction), and a higher proportion of acylated anthocyanins, than their respective controls. Expression of \{MYBA1\} and UFGT, but not MYB4, was correlated with anthocyanin pigmentation at half ripening and harvest, whereas overexpression of the acyltransferase gene Vv3AT was associated with higher anthocyanin acylation in \{HT\} berries. These results suggest that color development and pigment modifications in Malbec berries under \{HT\} are regulated at transcriptional level by MYBA1, UFGT, and Vv3AT genes. These data contribute to the general understanding on the effect of high temperatures on anthocyanin biochemistry and genetic regulation, and may have direct implications in the production of high-quality wines from Malbec and Bonarda.

Effects of calcium treatment combined with cold storage on the physical properties, polysaccharide content and nanostructure of apricots were investigated. Apricots were immersed in distilled water, 1% or 3% w/v calcium chloride, then stored at 5 °C or 10 °C. Storage at 5 °C significantly improved apricot quality and shelf life. Significant changes in the concentration and nanostructure of cell wall pectins and hemicelluloses revealed their disassembly and degradation during apricot storage. These modifications could be retarded by 1% w/v calcium chloride treatment. Meanwhile, the basic width units of apricot cell wall polysaccharide chains were 11.7, 31.2 and 39.1 nm for water-soluble pectin, 11.7, 17.6 and 19.5 nm for chelate-soluble pectin, and 15.6 and 23.4 nm for hemicellulose. The results suggest that texture of apricots can be effectively maintained by 1% calcium chloride treatment and storage at 5 °C. "

Application of post-harvest quality evolution models for perishables in evaluation of cold-chains (non-constant temperatures) and in model predictive control (MPC) poses specific requirements to the models: predictive, causal, stable, irreversible models are required that are valid for non-constant temperatures. In this paper a modelling methodology is presented in which the class of permitted models is limited by the above requirements. The methodology is used to develop a post-harvest mushroom quality evolution model. The resulting model fits well to experimental data collected for mushrooms from three different growers. The model is suitable for use in \{MPC\} and the evaluation of cold-chains with any possibly occurring temperature trajectory. No such model is currently available in the literature. "

Fruit and vegetable flesh temperatures well above 40°C have been recorded in direct sunlight in a wide range of crops in both hot and temperate climates. These high temperatures, both in terms of diurnal fluctuations and long-term exposure, can result in differences in internal quality properties such as sugar contents, tissue firmness, and oil levels, as well as in mineral content differences. Fruit with different temperature histories will also respond differently to postharvest low temperatures and heat treatments used for insect disinfestation. For example, avocado fruit from exposed sites on a tree have less chilling injury, whereas more chilling damage is found in exposed tissues of citrus and persimmons. Mechanisms of high temperature effects on postharvest responses are discussed, including the role of heat shock proteins, membrane damage, and skin characteristics. Differences in exposure of fruit on the tree may be responsible for much of the wide variation commonly found in fruit with regard to at-harvest quality, ripening and postharvest behaviour. "

The fruit were subjected to three different temperatures (6, 10 and 25 °C) with relative humidity of 80% for 24 days. In addition, the activities of polyphenol oxidase (PPO), peroxidase (POD) and catalase (CAT) were measured during storage. The results indicated that a decrease in \{TSS\} in fruit kept at 25 °C was noted, while \{TSS\} remained relatively constant in fruit storage temperature at 10 and 6 °C. A high correlation was observed between the different sugars during storage periods. There was a noticeable decline in sucrose content in pineapple fruit during storage, with a more rapid decrease with higher temperature. The maximum retentions of glucose and fructose concentrations can be achieved with storage of fruit at 6 °C rather than storage at 10 or 25 °C. The effective slowing down of vitamin C and \{TA\} rate of decreases was the fruit stored at 6 °C, followed by 10 and 25 °C. There was a decrease in contents of soluble proteins as storage temperature increased throughout the storage period, and significant differences were found between fruit stored at low temperature and room temperature after 12 d in storage. Storage temperature also significantly affected \{IB\} development, the incidence of \{IB\} was more rapid and with higher intensity in fruit held at 25 °C than 10 °C, and \{IB\} intensity was minimal in fruit held at 6 °C. Additionally, \{PPO\} activity increased with higher storage temperature during 24 days storage. \{CAT\} activity gradually increased at three storage temperatures and in the fruit stored at 25 °C was higher than those at 10 and 6 °C. However, \{POD\} activity was not influenced by storage condition. The results suggest that lower temperature can provide a useful means of maintaining quality and resist \{IB\} development during storage of pineapple fruit. "

Moreover, despite of its relevancy in crop responsiveness to elevated \{CO2\} conditions, plant level C balance is a topic that, comparatively, has received little attention. In order to test responsiveness of grapevine photosynthetic apparatus to predicted climate change conditions, grapevine (Vitis vinifera L. cv. Tempranillo) fruit-bearing cuttings were exposed to different \{CO2\} (elevated, 700 ppm vs. ambient, ca. 400 ppm), temperature (ambient vs. elevated, ambient +4 °C) and irrigation levels (partial vs. full irrigation). Carbon balance was followed monitoring net photosynthesis (AN, C gain), respiration (RD) and photorespiration (RL) (C losses). Modification of environment 13C isotopic composition (δ13C) under elevated \{CO2\} (from −10.30 to −24.93‰) enabled the further characterization of C partitioning into roots, cuttings, shoots, petioles, leaves, rachides and berries. Irrespective of irrigation level and temperature, exposure to elevated \{CO2\} induced photosynthetic acclimation of plants. C/N imbalance reflected the inability of plants grown at 700 ppm \{CO2\} to develop strong C sinks. Partitioning of labeled C to storage organs (main stem and roots) did not avoid accumulation of labeled photoassimilates in leaves, affecting negatively Rubisco carboxylation activity. The study also revealed that, after 20 days of treatment, no oxidative damage to chlorophylls or carotenoids was observed, suggesting a protective role of \{CO2\} either at current or elevated temperatures against the adverse effect of water stress.

Although there is a large number of reports about heat treatments on broccoli heads, the effect of subjecting only the stems to thermal treatments has not been studied yet. One of the main reasons to analyze this approach is that the hormone ethylene is actively produced in the stem cutting area. Different hot water treatments were performed on the first 5 cm of broccoli stems with various combinations of time-temperature. Treatment carried out at 50 °C for 3 min was chosen for further analysis of different quality and senescence parameters, taking into account that broccoli heads presented a delayed change in Hue and L values when compared with controls during storage. While control heads looked yellow, heat-treated samples retained most of their green colour. Furthermore, control heads presented higher weight loss, lower total and soluble protein, and lower total soluble sugar after 3 or 5 storage days, giving evidence of the fact that a heat treatment just on the stem contributes to the delay of broccoli senescence and to the maintenance of the overall quality of the product during storage.

The emphasis is on the temperate cool climate of Western Europe. Physiological processes such as respiration and photosynthesis can acclimate to increasing atmospheric \{CO2\} and temperatures. The effect of increased \{CO2\} on vegetables is mostly beneficial for production, but may alter internal product quality, or result in photosynthetic down-regulation. Heat stress reduces fruit set of fruiting vegetables, and speeds up development of determinate vegetables, shortening their time for photoassimilation. In both cases, yield losses result with an impaired product quality, thereby increasing production waste. A longer growing season, arising from warmer temperatures, allows a greater number of plantings to be cultivated, contributing to greater annual yields. However, some vegetables need a period of cold accumulation to produce a harvest. Despite the increasing potential for winter cultivation in the future, perennials like asparagus might increasingly suffer from a lack of winter chilling. In cauliflower, higher temperatures will likely cause insufficient vernalization delaying head induction. This review may contribute in improving the adaptation strategies of vegetable production to climate change for a sustainable horticulture due to an effective risk management by meeting the problems of possible waste increase; breeding of new heat, drought and pest tolerant cultivars; secure water resources; increase the use of renewable energy sources; stimulating new ideas in innovative technologies; development of new approaches to secure stable yields and improve the product quality of vegetables for a cleaner production. © Elsevier.

No changes in fruit skin color or in flesh acidity were observed as ripening progressed. Ripe fruit had 30% or higher SSC, orange or red flesh (hue angle=52; chroma=45; L=60), acidity of 6–8 mM H+, and flesh firmness (compression force) ≤50 N.

Similar or related disorders were grouped into three categories: disorders in unripe fruit, pathological disorders of ripe fruit (rots) and physiological disorders of ripe fruit. A logistic non-linear mixed effects model and its simplified version with normal errors on the logit linear predictor gave a good general description of relationship between postharvest disorders and dry matter at harvest, storage temperature and storage duration, but not for predictions of disorder for individual orchards. The capacity of the model to predict disorder incidence was limited largely by the variability among orchards and seasons. It is concluded that while the mixed effects model does describe well the relationships of the disorder categories with storage temperature, storage duration and dry matter, any predictions of disorder at the orchard level are likely to have large prediction errors because of the high variability among orchards and seasons. The challenge in the future is to determine, and incorporate into the model, those factors that contribute to the large variation among orchards and seasons. "

Fruit were harvested in three stages of maturity (mature-green primarily, turning and mature) and treated for 1 to 12 h with 0 (control in air) or 1 μL L−1 1-Methylcyclopropene (1-MCP) at 20 °C. The mature-green fruit were subjected to different storage conditions (7, 10, 12, 13, 20 or 27 °C). The treatment of mature-green fruit with 1-MCP for 1 h, and storage at 12 °C for up to 2 weeks prolonged the shelf-life about one week by delaying or reducing the respiration and ethylene production rates, skin colour changes, the loss of organic acids, and softening, with or without a further shelf-life period of 3 days at 20 °C. At 7 °C, 1-MCP also reduced mature-green fruit weight loss and shrivelling. Extending 1-MCP treatment periods at 20 °C to 6 or 12 h caused partial and uneven ripeness. Treating fruit in their post-climacteric stage of maturity had little effect on ripening compared with the mature-green stage. 1-MCP increased the respiration rate and/or the ethylene production in certain combinations of advanced harvest maturities and/or unfavourable storage temperatures. Recommendations for maintaining postharvest quality are harvesting at the mature-green stage, treatment with 1 μL L−1 of 1-MCP for 1 h, and storage at 12 °C for up to 2 weeks. "

B. buxifolia fruit growth and composition presented significant changes during the fruiting period and the studied growing seasons. Fresh and dry weight of B. buxifolia fruits exhibited a typical double sigmoid curve. The first period of rapid growth was from full flower phase till 42–56 days after, while the second phase of rapid growth began around the 56–70 days from full flower and ended approximately 4 months later. On a dry weight basis the maximum fruit biomass (119.5 mg) was reached 112 days after full flower while maximum fresh weight fruit biomass (424.3 mg) occurred by day 84. Evolution of fruit growth was related with the compositional changes evaluated. By day 126 from full flower, soluble solids (24.9°Brix) and anthocyanin concentration (761.3 mg/100 g fruit fresh weight) were at their maximum values, while at this time the total titratable acidity was at a minimum value (2.56%). The results obtained not only contributes to the knowledge of the quantitative content of anthocyanin, a metabolite with nutraceutical value but, gives some tools for the definition of the optimal harvest time of B. buxifolia fruits, what it is important for fruit destination.

abstract = "Abstract Coffee is the major export product of some countries such as Uganda, Burundi, Rwanda, and Ethiopia and is the second beverage widely consumed in the world. The international coffee trade involves about 500 million people in its management, from cultivation to the final consumption. Among some 100 species of the Coffea genus, only C. arabica and C. canephora are economically important worldwide. The basis of the coffee activity success relies on the adoption of good agricultural and processing practices. Harvesting is one of the most important steps that influences coffee quality. Harvesting coffee is particularly challenging because coffee fruit typically does not ripen uniformly. Almost all fine coffee is still picked selectively by hand. Coffee beans must be removed from the fruit and dried before they can be roasted; this can be done in two ways: natural (dry) and wet (washed) methods. Drying operation is the most important stage of the process affecting the final quality of the green coffee. In some regions or in certain years, coffee quality is inferior due to environmental conditions, mainly related to temperatures and relative humidity favoring the development of spoiled microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, and yeast) that had a negative impact on the quality of the coffee. However, some microorganisms like the genus Cladosporium and yeasts are associated with good quality beverages. In all processing methods (dry, wet, and semidry), the objectives of fermentation are to remove the mucilaginous layer rich in polysaccharides (pectin) and to reduce the water content present in the fruits. The fermentation process when well controlled ensures the development of microorganisms that give a high-quality beverage with good coffee aroma. In agricultural products, such as coffee, could have the development of the filamentous fungi and possible mycotoxin production. Coffee bean contamination with ochratoxin A (OTA) may occur throughout the entire production chain and is directly related to the care and quality of the crop management, harvest, postharvest storage, and type of roasting. The types of roasting and particle size interfere with the residual content of \{OTA\} in the beverage. "

The effects of the coatings on the physicochemical and sensory characteristics of cherry tomato fruits during storage were also assessed. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of \{CHI\} against all test fungi was 8 mg/mL, whereas the \{MIC\} for both \{MPEO\} and \{MVEO\} was 5 μL/mL. Combinations of \{CHI\} at 4 mg/mL and \{MPEO\} or \{MVEO\} at 2.5 or 1.25 μL/mL strongly inhibited the mycelial growth and spore germination of target fungi. The coatings comprising \{CHI\} and \{MPEO\} or \{CHI\} and \{MVEO\} at the different tested concentrations delayed the growth of decay-causing fungi in artificially contaminated tomato fruit during storage at either room temperature or low temperature. The assayed coatings preserved the quality of cherry tomato fruit during storage, in terms of physicochemical and sensory attributes.

The goal of this study was to evaluate the combined effect of 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP) and modified-atmosphere packaging (MAP) compared to \{MAP\} alone in maintaining the quality and antioxidant activity of Kulai pepper during low-temperature storage. The enzymatic activities and expression levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and lipoxygenase (LOX) were determined to evaluate the changes in their molecular levels in response to the postharvest treatment. The concentrations of total antioxidants as well as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) were also determined to evaluate the changes in the antioxidant status during storage. The study revealed that a combination treatment (1-MCP and MAP) had a pronounced effect, extending the shelf life of the fruit up to 25 days over \{MAP\} treatment alone with the retention of high antioxidant content. The combined treatment greatly suppressed the production of \{H2O2\} and \{TBARS\} by 29.3% and 57.6% concomitant with an 8-fold increase in \{SOD\} activity and a decrease in \{LOX\} activity up to 75.4% relative to the control. The total antioxidant level increased consistently throughout the storage period. The overall results indicated that the combination treatment of \{MAP\} and 1-MCP provided a sustained protective effect for Kulai peppers stored at low temperature, with the quality of the pepper maintained throughout handling.

Increasing the temperature of the hot air heat treatment (HT) progressively reduced flesh gelling and alleviated chilling injury. However, external and internal browning increased with greater \{HT\} temperatures and duration. Least chilling injury and external browning were observed at 47°C for 0.5–3 h.

Screening anti-browning and anti-bacterial agents is important for preservation of Chinese Olive. Caffeic acid N-nonyl ester (C-9) and caffeic acid N- Heptyl ester (C-7) was synthesized as inhibitors of tyrosinase, which is a key enzyme in browning process. The compound of C-9 could inhibit the activity of tyrosinase strongly and its \{IC50\} value was determined to be 37.5 μM, while the compound of C-7 had no inhibitory ability. Kinetic analyses showed that compound of C-9 has been a reversible inhibitory mechanism below 50 μM and been irreversible mechanisms above 50 μM. For the reversible inhibitory mechanism, the values of inhibitory constants (KI and KIS) were determined to be 24.6 and 37.4 μM, respectively. The results of Chinese Olive fruit postharvest showed that the compound of C-9 could effectively anti-browning and anti-bacterial putrefaction. In addition, this compound had strong antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis and Salmonella. Therefore, C-9 could be a potential anti-browning and anti-bacterial reagent. "

Longan fruit have a short shelf life at ambient temperature. Main determinants of shelf life and marketability are microbial decay and pericarp browning and postharvest protocols have been developed to reduce these defects. Recent research has focused on maintaining high fruit quality. Quarantine issues associated with fruit fly are also being addressed to secure overseas markets for longan fruit, and heat treatments and gamma or ionizing radiation disinfestation protocols have been investigated. In the light of health benefits, functional food products from longan fruit should be developed in the future. "

In this paper, the study of the variations of aroma of oranges, during the storage, and apples, due to the presence of mealiness and skin damage by means of a thickness shear mode quartz resonators- (TSMR) based electronic nose, is illustrated and discussed. Results have evidenced that the electronic nose has enough sensitivity and resolution to distinguish among the various classes and to correctly predict the amount of defects (for apples) and storage days (for oranges).

Successful application of qRT-PCR requires the accurate quantification of relative transcript levels, which strongly depends on the expression stability of the reference genes used as internal controls for data normalization. Plums (Prunus salicina Lindl.) are among the most numerous and commercial important fruit trees. In order to ensure the reliability of gene expression analyses using qRT-PCR in plum molecular biology research, 14 candidate reference genes were selected, and their relative expression levels were further measured by qRT-PCR using samples of plum peels obtained via different postharvest processes. Three statistical algorithms, geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper, were employed to assess the expression stability of each candidate gene. A comprehensive evaluation was generated by the overall analysis approach, RefFinder to infer the final rankings. The results showed that \{CAC\} was the most stably expressed candidate reference gene across all experimental conditions. \{CAC\} and \{UNK\} under the room temperature treatment, CAC, ACT, and \{CLATH\} under the cold treatment, and \{CAC\} and \{ACT\} under all treatments were suitable for accurate gene expression quantification. In addition, relative gene expression patterns of the plant anthocyanin biosynthesis-related structural gene PsANS were evaluated using selected housekeeping genes as internal controls under two treatments to further confirm the usefulness of the selected reference genes. These results indicated that the selection of systematically validated reference genes for specific experimental conditions is necessary to avoid misinterpretation of qRT-PCR data and to obtain accurate and reliable gene expression results.

Date palms grow in several countries, but the industry is still concentrated in the Middle East and North Africa. Over 7 million tons of dates are produced annually, but only about 10% enters world trade. Dates are a nutritious, high-energy food, consumed fresh, dried or in various processed forms. Fruit of some dry date cultivars are not very perishable, and can thus easily be shipped to distant markets and be stored for prolonged periods. In contrast, the shelf life of some moist (soft or syrupy) date cultivars is limited to a few days unless special care is taken to maintain the cold chain between harvest and consumption sites. However, postharvest losses are high due to diverse physical, physiological, pathological and insect problems. Dates adapt very well to very low temperatures, and therefore storage and shipping at low temperatures is the most important method of maintaining quality. Low temperatures significantly reduce losses of colour, flavour, and textural quality; and delay development of sugar spotting, incidence of moulds and yeasts, and insect infestation; and prevent development of syrupiness and souring of soft, moist dates.

Furthermore Chitosan delayed fruit senescence (as expressed by SF/WF ratio) during the long-storage period. All treatments did not affect the overall postharvest quality, nevertheless some compounds (such as total soluble sugar for Chitosan and Thyme; total carotenoids and flavonols for Chitosan; total organic acids, 2-(E)-hexenal, 2-isobutylthiazole and terpenes for Propolis), were better retained than the control during postharvesting period.

Treatment efficacy was diagnosed by the percentage of survivors emerging as adults from fumigated cherries relative to that from non-fumigated control cherries. A kinetic model of sorption was developed based on the measurement of \{MB\} and how calculated exposures varied across the fumigation trials. The model describes how to manipulate the applied \{MB\} dose, fumigation duration, and the load factor so that the resultant exposure is adequate for \{SWD\} control across various pulp temperatures when cherries are fumigated in wooden versus plastic bins. Results are discussed in the context of graduation toward optimized quarantine fumigation schedules for control of SWD, which will promote more strategic technical and economic Quarantine Pre-shipment (QPS) use of MB.

Most of the physiological and biochemical changes during storage and ripening were affected by 1-MCP in a dose-dependent manner. The two higher concentrations 1-MCP treatments extended the storage life, decreased weight loss and delayed the rate of softening, loss of taste, browning incidence in skin color (C* and ho values). 1-MCP treatments also retarded the decline of titratable acidity. During the early stage of storage, total phenolics, total flavonoids, total condensed tannins, ascorbic acid, antioxidant activity and organic acids gradually decreased in all treatments. The reduced changes in the total phenolics, total flavonoids, total condensed tannins, ascorbic acid, antioxidant activity, as well as individual organic acid (malic and oxalic acids) contents showed the effectiveness of 0.4 and 0.6 μL L−1 1-MCP in retarding fruit ripening.

Experiments compared irrigation scheduling using conventional micrometeorology (110% of crop evapotranspiration, ETc) as a control treatment (TCTL), a treatment based on the normal practice of the farmer (TFARMER) and a regulated deficit irrigation treatment (TRDI), which involved irrigating the crop at the same level as the control (TCTL) during the critical periods of the first year (second rapid fruit growth period and 2 months after harvest) and at 60% \{TCTL\} during postharvest. In the last two years (2010 and 2011), the irrigation was scheduled to maintain the signal intensity (SI) of the maximum daily shrinkage of the trunk (MDS, \{SI\} = MDSTRDI/MDSTCTL) at different water stress levels depending on the phenological stage \{SI\} = 1.0 (non-water stress) and \{SI\} = 1.4 (moderate water stress). Most of the time that irrigation scheduling was based on \{MDS\} SI, this parameter varied only slightly around the pre-established threshold values. The information given by the stem diameter sensors and stem water potential (Ψstem) gave −1.5 \{MPa\} and \{MDS\} \{SI\} 1.5 as threshold values not to be exceeded during postharvest, since \{MDS\} and Ψstem \{SI\} values were only linear down to 1.5. The water saved amounted to 17, 15 and 37% of the amount used in the control in the three seasons, respectively. In contrast, the \{TFARMER\} treatment applied more water (about 20 and 5% more than TCTL) during the first 2 years, and 10% less than \{TCTL\} during the third season. "

These symptoms are manifested by skin browning, surface pitting and desiccation and accompanied by increases in electrolyte leakage leading to quality losses and reduced shelf-life. In this chapter, an overview of the chilling injury incidence and its possible minimization throughout appropriate post-harvest treatments is provided, with special emphasis on some innovative tools such as the natural compounds methyl jasmonate and methyl salicylate. These treatments reduced chilling injury and enhanced the content of bioactive compounds and the total antioxidant activity of the arils along storage leading to fruit with enhanced phytochemicals and increased health-beneficial properties to consumers.

Although causes of the disorder are not fully understood, evidence indicates that altered water relations in fruit peel is a major factor inducing peel pitting during postharvest storage. In this work, the effect of commercial packingline and manual processing and subsequent storage under low and high \{RH\} regimes on water, osmotic and turgor potentials in three layers of ‘Marsh’ grapefruit peel (flavedo and internal and external albedo) was investigated. At the end of the storage period at 45% RH, peel water potential was lower in fruit processed on a commercial packingline compared to those processed manually. Transfer of dehydrated fruit to 95% \{RH\} increased water potential of flavedo at the expense of albedo cell layers, which underwent subsequent water loss. Water potential of flavedo in packingline-processed fruit did not recover by transferring to high RH. Osmotic potential in peel tissues did not change as significantly as water potential. As a consequence, turgor pressure decreased in all three peel tissues of fruit stored at 45% RH, this decrease being more pronounced in packingline-processed fruit. In manually wax-coated fruit stored at 45% RH, transfer to 95% \{RH\} induced a recovery of turgor potential. In contrast, turgor pressure did not recover in packingline-processed fruit similarly treated, and severe peel pitting developed. The results suggest that the inability to properly carry out water adjustments after prolonged water stress leads to cell collapse and peel damage. Together, the data link alterations in water, osmotic and turgor potential in flavedo and albedo with the induction of postharvest peel pitting in citrus fruit. "

Most explanatory models are photosynthesis-based models. Important components of photosynthesis-based models are leaf area development, light interception, photosynthesis and respiration. Leaf area is predominantly simulated as a function of plant developmental stage or of simulated leaf dry weight. Crop photosynthesis can be calculated as a function of intercepted radiation or more accurately by considering radiation absorption of different leaf layers in combination with a submodel for leaf photosynthesis. In most crop growth models respiration is subdivided into two components: growth and maintenance. There is reasonable consensus concerning the simulation of growth respiration, but the simulation of maintenance respiration is still an area of great uncertainty, which is especially important for large crops grown under winter conditions at relatively high greenhouse temperatures. \{DM\} partitioning can be simulated by descriptive allometry, functional equilibrium or sink regulation. The most suitable approach depends on the type of crop studied and the aim of the model. As opposed to most agricultural crops, the \{DM\} content of the harvestable product is of great importance to the yield of most horticultural crops. More attention should be paid to the simulation of \{DM\} content. It is concluded that the strong features of explanatory crop growth models are the simulation of light interception and gross photosynthesis, while the weak features are the simulation of leaf area development, maintenance respiration, organ abortion, \{DM\} content and product quality.

Isabella (Vitis labrusca L.) that were caused by Aspergillus niger, Botrytis cinerea, Penicillium expansum and Rhizopus stolonifer were evaluated. The effects of the coatings on physicochemical and sensory characteristics of the grapes were also assessed. The coatings containing chitosan (4, 8 mg/mL) and \{MPEO\} or \{MVEO\} (1.25, 2.5, 5 μL/mL) delayed the mold growth and reduced the incidence of infections caused by all test fungi in grapes during storage at room and low temperatures. The coatings (chitosan 4 mg/mL; \{MPEO\} or \{MVEO\} 1.25, 2.5 μL/mL) did not negatively affect the physicochemical and sensory characteristics of grapes. From these results, coatings containing chitosan and \{MPEO\} or \{MVEO\} are potential postharvest treatments to control common mold infections in table grape cv. Isabella. Industrial relevance In table grapes, the reduction of losses resulting from fungal rot is a major goal of postharvest technology, which seeks to use effective methods to control the contamination and the growth of phytopathogenic fungi. However, the negative consumer perception of synthetic fungicides used for many years to solve the problem of mold infections in table grapes and the development of fungicide-resistant strains have impelled researchers to study the efficacy of natural compounds against postharvest pathogenic fungi. In this context, edible coatings composed of chitosan and essential oils have been considered as an environmentally friendly and added-value technology to control fungal postharvest decay in table grapes because of their biodegradability and lack of phytotoxicity. In this study, the authors evaluated composite coatings that contained shrimp chitosan and reduced amounts of Mentha (piperita L. or x vilosa Huds) essential oil as postharvest treatment to control the occurrence of mold infections caused by fungi in table grape cv. Isabella (Vitis labrusca L.), and their effects on the quality attributes of this fruit during storage. The tested composite coatings are presented as possible alternative technologies to control fungal infections and related post-harvest losses in table grape cv. Isabella. "

The aim of this work was the investigation of the Corvina anthocyanin profile changes during ripening. The experiment took place in 2015, in two vineyards located in Valpolicella (Italy) with different training systems (Guyot and pergola). Micro-meteorological survey, carpological characterization, chemical analysis and transcriptional studies were carried out to clarify the anthocyanin biosynthesis regulation. Air and grape temperatures and global solar radiation inside the canopy were measured during the season. Grape samples were collected at seven stages of berry development from bunches hang until harvest. Berry growth was followed by volume increase. At the beginning of the lag phase, anthocyanin quantification and characterization by spectroscopy and \{HPLC\} were carried out. The expression level of structural and regulatory genes of anthocyanin pathway was studied via real-time RT-PCR. At color appearance, the di-substituted anthocyanins prevailed. During ripening, it was observed a progressive increase of tri-substituted, methoxylated, and acylated pigments. A clear correlation among expression of anthocyanin biosynthetic gene, UDPglucose:flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferase (UFGT), transcription factors, MybA1 and MybA2, and total anthocyanin content during berry development has been identified. Chalcone synthase, flavonoid 3′-hydroxylase (F3′H) and flavonoid 3′,5′-hydroxylase (F3′5′H) genes of the flavonoid pathway showed high correlation as well. The proportion changes between tri- and di-substituted anthocyanins were associated with an increasing ratio of F3′5′H/F3′H gene transcription during ripening. The \{AOMT\} genes were expressed with a maximum at the onset of ripening, coherently with the rapid increase of methoxylated anthocyanin proportion in this stage. "

A decrease of the diameter was clearly visible in samples stored at 20 °C after 3 weeks and a coarse contour of the pericarp appeared after 40 days. Accumulation of water in the pericarp was found, suggesting a migration towards the outer regions occurs and that the fruit water loss due to evapo-transpiration is slower than the migration process. Samples stored at 0 °C showed no relevant changes in dimension and structural features for the whole period considered except after removal to shelf life. The observed variations of the internal morphology were correlated with the transverse relaxation times of defined areas and with softening of fruits. Measured \{T2\} profiles showed double-exponential decays, a fast- and a slow-relaxing component, indicating the existence of two different types of water molecules within cellular tissues: strongly and weakly bound, respectively.

This is primarily consumed locally, while only a small quantity is exported. However, the shelf life of Mukunuvenna is as low about 3-4 days due to leaf yellowing and wilting. Consumers prefer green and turgid leafy vegetables and thus the loss is considerably high after wilting and yellowing. Ethylene is a critical problem in leaf senescence. Minute concentrations such as 1 μL/L ethylene can affect leaf yellowing significantly. Thus, an ethylene blocker, 1-Methylcyclopropene (1-MCP), which is now commonly being used in the fruit industry, can be considered as an effective solution for extending the postharvest life of A. sessilis. It is not toxic and environmentally friendly thus safe with edible produce. The present study was done, with the objective of investigating effects of 1-MCP on postharvest life and sensory qualities. Two experiments were conducted for several dosages (concentration × time) to investigate the shelf-life performances and processed A. sessilis samples were used to check sensory qualities such as taste, smell, texture and colour. Samples treated with 1-MCP showed high levels of chlorophyll, lower yellowing and higher overall quality. Postharvest life of treated samples increased by 1 full-day (25% increase) under the room temperature. 1-MCP, 5 ppm for 8 hour duration showed promising results. However, the obtained results did not show a specific treatment combination as the best treatment and 1-MCP did not alter the sensory qualities of the processed product. "

The chitosan suppressed the respiratory rate, fresh weight loss, firmness and skin color with delay in the degradation of chlorophyll. In the treatment with 2% and 3% of chitosan in the solid soluble content and ascorbic acid were reduced; retarded the loss of titratable acidity during 96 h after treatment. These treatment induced significant decreases in the phenylalanine ammonia-lyase activity and significantly increases of peroxidase Activity.

The soluble solids content and weight loss were measured daily and wines were made from grapes when they reached 24.8 and 26.7 °Brix. The soluble solids of grapes increased about 1 °Brix per day; therefore, on the third and fourth day the berries reached the desired concentration; weight loss was 14 and 16%, respectively. Results from berry phenolic analysis indicated that per berry anthocyanin amount remained unchanged during dehydration. The composition of proanthocyanidins isolated from berries changed during dehydration. Volatile compounds in wines made from dehydrated grapes contained more terpenes and norisoprenoids (β-ionone, β-damascenone) when compared to wine made from the original fruit. Wines made from increasingly dehydrated grapes tended to resemble the composition and flavour profile of wines made from grapes left on the vine (i.e. with extended ripening). The results of this study suggest that postharvest flavour changes consistent with changes during fruit ripening can occur in grapes when harvested early and allowed to dehydrate under controlled conditions prior to fermentation.

This area is characterized by low-medium altitude, warm summers with hot day–night temperatures, cold winters and low annual precipitation. Most accessions were surveyed during the last decades from Spanish regions with different climate environments. Agronomic traits included bloom and harvest dates, while morphological traits included different fruit shape and size characteristics. Fruit quality parameters included percentage of over color, chromaticity parameters (L*, a*, b*, C* and h*), flesh firmness, soluble solids content and titratable acidity. Extensive variability was observed for most traits with significant correlations identified between many traits. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed the main sources of variability in the set of accessions evaluated. Based on these sources, the cluster analysis produced six different groups of accessions according to the Ward's minimum variance criterion. Eight groups of synonymies were found which represented 21% of the total accessions studied. On the contrary, some accessions with the same allelic profile exhibit phenotypic differences, suggesting the existence of clonal mutations not detected with molecular markers. This study provides useful information for agronomic, morphological and fruit quality traits from a wide range of accessions grown under the Ebro Valley vulnerable climatic conditions. In addition, the most interesting materials could be used in breeding programs as parental genotypes to obtain apple cultivars with better adaptation to the limiting Spanish agro-climatic conditions.

abstract = "In plants, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGR) catalyses the synthesis of mevalonate from 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A. It has been reported to be the rate-limiting enzyme in sesquiterpene and triterpene biosynthesis and is encoded by a small gene family. The accumulation of α-farnesene in the skin tissue of apple fruit during storage appears to be predominantly through the classical mevalonate pathway and not through the novel glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate/pyruvate pathway independent of \{HMGR\} action. The content of α-farnesene in the skin tissue increased during the first 8 weeks of storage at 0 °C in air, and started declining after 12 weeks. In contrast, \{HMGR\} activity in the total membrane and soluble fractions, was the highest at the time of harvest, but decreased during the first 8 weeks in storage and remained stable thereafter. The potent ethylene action inhibitor 1-methylcyclopropene inhibited α-farnesene evolution and \{HMGR\} activity by 97 and 30 %, respectively. As a first step in studying the molecular mechanism of apple \{HMGR\} regulation, we have isolated and cloned a full-length cDNA (hmg1) as well as a fragment (hmg2), using apple skin mRNA and RT-PCR in the presence of degenerate oligonucleotides designed against conserved regions of plant \{HMGR\} genes. Genomic Southern analysis using probes designed for the 3’-end of the two cDNA clones confirmed the presence of at least two \{HMGR\} genes in apple. The cDNA for hmg1 has an open reading frame of 1 767 nucleotides. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence revealed that the cDNA encodes a polypeptide of 589 residues with a relative molecular mass of 62.7 kDa. The hydropathy profile of the putative polypeptide indicated the presence of two highly hydrophobic domains near the amino terminus. Northern blot analysis confirmed that both hmg1 and hmg2 transcripts possessed a size of 2.4 kb. The two genes are differentially expressed during low temperature storage and in response to C2H4, with hmg1 being expressed constitutively and hmg2 being relatively more sensitive to developmental stimuli and ethylene.

Our previous work has shown that monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDHAR) activity was positively correlated with fruit resistance to cold storage in introgression lines of tomato, Solanum lycopersicum. We have produced transgenic lines with reduced \{MDHAR\} activity to directly study the impact of this gene on fruit resistance to chilling and the antioxidant pool in two different genetic backgrounds: M82, a processing tomato with low to medium ascorbate levels, and IL925, an introgression line of \{M82\} containing a fragment of the wild tomato Solanum pennellii genome, including the S. pennelli \{MDHAR\} allele. Large decreases in fruit \{MDHAR\} activity were obtained and correlated with slight losses in fruit firmness and fruit ascorbate, an effect that was independent of the genetic background. Fruit colour after chilling was also positively correlated with the redox state of the ascorbate pool and fruit firmness, although at harvest these correlations were less significant. Furthermore, other modifications in fruit of transgenic lines were observed as red fruit showed increased glutathione levels. Therefore manipulation of \{MDHAR\} activity confirms the link between antioxidant protection, fruit tolerance to chilling and fruit ripening at low temperatures, although the strength of the phenotypes indicates that other factors are involved.

Harvested fruit were stored at 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20 °C for 5, 12 and 17 days. Measurements of SSC, firmness, flesh colour, fatty acid composition and electrolyte leakage were performed during the experiment. Kiwifruit did not fully ripen during the 17 days storage at any temperature. The major fatty acid component in ‘Hayward’ kiwifruit consisted of linolenic, followed by oleic, palmitic, linoleic and stearic acid. Membrane permeability and unsaturated/saturated fatty acid ratio increased during storage in all treatments. The highest increase was during the first 5 days and at the lowest temperatures. The increase in unsaturated/saturated fatty acid ratio was caused mainly by a decrease in palmitic and an increase in oleic acids. Stearic, linoleic and linolenic acids had insignificant changes during storage. The main increase in electrolyte leakage and unsaturated/saturated fatty acid ratio occurred during the first storage days and at lower temperatures, probably as a response of the tissue to an adaptation to the new stress storage conditions.

The obtained experimental results classified the drying with solar ventilation drying mode (DSV) and combination drying mode (DCM) in favorable operating conditions needed for the studied case. Measured air drying temperatures ranged between 41.8 and 56.0 °C and 39.3 and 51.2 °C respectively for the two above techniques. The drying duration to obtain the standard moisture content (0.35 kg/kg DM) was respectively 5.25 and 8 h.

Low temperature storage (LTS) is widely used as a postharvest treatment applied to delay senescence in vegetables and ornamentals and ripening in fruits, so upholding their postharvest quality. But the problem of its application to tropical and subtropical fruits and vegetables is the susceptibility of these to chilling injury (CI) at temperatures below 12 ̊C. Chilling injury is a physiological disorder that greatly reduces fruit quality, frequently rendering the product unsellable. To increase the tolerance of produce to \{CI\} and extend storage life, postharvest protocols such as cold storage coupled with heat treatments, temperature preconditioning, intermittent warming, modified and controlled atmosphere storage, ultraviolet (UV) light, and salicylates and jasmonates treatments have been developed. Membrane damage and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production are multifaceted adverse effects of chilling stress in sensitive fruits and vegetables. They have been attributed to the higher \{CI\} tolerance of horticultural products to production and accumulation of heat shock proteins (HSPs), suggesting a central role of \{HSPs\} in the acquired tolerance to chilling stress. This beneficial action of \{HSPs\} is possible thanks to their chaperone activity. Besides chaperone activity, small \{HSPs\} (sHSPs) are able to function as membrane stabilizers and \{ROS\} scavengers or to act synergistically with antioxidant system. sHSPs play a key role in maintaining membrane quality attributes such as fluidity and permeability under chilling stress. In fact, the analysis of sHSPs could be envisaged as an ideal method for the assessment of fruits and vegetables’ tolerance to \{CI\} and for evaluating the efficiency of postharvest treatments in avoiding \{CI\} incidence. This review discusses \{HSPs\} and their language of action in mitigation of \{CI\} and their potential use as biochemical markers to optimize the use of postharvest treatments. It bridges the division between basic and applied research, and proposes the use of \{HSPs\} as biochemical markers of CI. "

In two other \{CA\} units apple fruit were exposed to extremely low oxygen conditions while monitoring the fluorescence signal. The latter spiked when the oxygen level was reduced below 0.2%. The oxygen level was subsequently set to 0.4% in one \{CA\} unit and 0.7% in the other. In all \{CA\} units the temperature and \{CO2\} levels were maintained at 1.2 ± 0.2 °C and 3%, respectively. Instrumental measurements were used to analyze quality attributes of apples at harvest and after 1, 4.5, 7 and 10 months of storage plus 0 day and 7 days of shelf life. Sensory quality was evaluated after 4.5 and 10 months of storage. After 10 months of storage, apples stored in extremely low oxygen controlled atmosphere storage had a better color retention than control fruits. The apple firmness, \{SSC\} and acidity were not affected by the storage condition. Sensory evaluation tests indicated no significant difference between the two storage conditions. Apples removed after 10 months of storage plus 7 days of shelf life were completely free of any disorder in both storage conditions.

In the present paper we compare fruit quality parameters in different zucchini cultivars with the production of ethylene and the expression of two ethylene biosynthesis genes (CpACS1 and CpACO1) throughout postharvest storage at 4, 12 and 20 °C. In fruit stored at 12 or 20° ethylene production and expression of CpACS1 and CpACO1 genes remained very low throughout the whole storage period. Ethylene production was also low at 4 °C, but was induced rapidly upon transfer to 20 °C for a minimum of 4 h. The expression of both CpACS1 and CpACO1 genes was also induced by storage at 4 °C. This cold-induced ethylene is not necessary for triggering chilling injury (CI) symptoms in zucchini, since they were already evident in the cold chambers before rewarming of the fruit and, therefore, before the burst of ethylene. However, the level of the cold-induced ethylene was lower in those cultivars that were more tolerant to CI, and it fell in response to temperature conditioning treatments that alleviate \{CI\} symptoms.

In this study, the economic impact of harvest date on revenue based on percentage pack-out (fruit size/weight and red coloration) and disorder incidence has been investigated using a budgeting model. Fruit were harvested from a commercial orchard weekly for three weeks; \{H1\} (one week before normal harvest), \{H2\} (normal harvest), and \{H3\} (one week after normal harvest). Fruit samples were either untreated or treated with 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP) and stored under controlled atmosphere (CA) conditions (2 kPa O2; 2 kPa CO2) at 0.5 °C and 2 °C. Field bins of fruit were used to assess pack-out percentages. Flesh browning was low at \{H1\} and unaffected by 1-MCP treatment, whereas incidence was highest in fruit from H3, and especially in 1-MCP treated fruit stored at 2 °C. The enterprise budget model shows that net profits for a one hectare high density planting vary slightly between fresh-marketed fruit in the fall, and for fruit stored after nine months in \{CA\} storage, both with and without 1-MCP treatment. Net profits from one hectare are higher for \{H3\} when fruit are marketed in the fall, in comparison to the normal harvest (H2), but at harvest, pack-out was substantially lower for fruit from H1. Fruit quality and pack-out percentages after storage depended not only on the harvest date but also on storage temperature and 1-MCP treatment. Therefore, there is an economic tradeoff between harvest date, occurrence of flesh browning, and likely net profits to producers of ‘Empire’ apples. "

abstract = "Abstract Fruits and vegetables are an integral part of the human diet. Many developing countries such as Tanzania experience post-harvest losses of 40%, and there is little ability to preserve and store foods for off-season consumption due to expensive or unreliable energy and a lack of access to refrigeration. Alternatively, fruits and vegetables can be dehydrated using solar crop dryers. Because many developing countries are in tropical regions, properly dehydrating fruits and vegetables to moisture levels appropriate for storage and off-season consumption can be difficult. In an attempt to overcome the challenges of the high humidity, intermittent clouds, and haze often present in tropical climates, this paper investigates the effectiveness of adding a concave solar concentrator built from low-cost, locally available materials to a typical Tanzanian solar crop dryer. Two identical solar crop dryers were constructed, with one serving as the control and the other for testing the solar concentrator. Drying trials using Roma tomatoes with initial moisture content of approximately 90% were conducted in Davis, California (38° 32′ 42″ N/121° 44′ 21″ W) in various climatic conditions throughout the summer and fall. Tomatoes were considered dried at 10% moisture content. Temperature, relative humidity, and solar radiation were measured outside as well as within each of the dryers to determine how the addition of a solar concentrator can affect the drying rate of tomatoes in solar crop dryers. The concentrator proved to be effective, reducing drying time by 21% in addition to increasing internal dryer temperature and reducing relative humidity. An additional study on the quality of the fresh and dried tomatoes found that the pH, titratable acidity, color, Brix, lycopene, and vitamin C determined there was no significant difference in quality between tomatoes dried with and without the concentrator.

abstract = "Stone fruits require rapid cooling within a few hours of harvest. High temperature and cooling delays can speed fruit deterioration from several causes. Flesh softening is most rapid at temperatures between ≈4 and 38°C, where ethylene sensitivity is greatest. Water loss is related to exposure time and the magnitude of water vapour pressure difference between fruit and environment. Internal breakdown, a low temperature injury problem, is aggravated in California by high temperature delays before cooling. Fruit rot organisms spread most rapidly at warm harvest temperatures and are slowed or stopped at near 0°C. When packing is delayed, then cooling before packing is essential. Because injury susceptibility is least at intermediate temperatures (5–20°C), fruit may be cooled to 5–10°C for next day packing, but should be cooled to near 0°C for longer delays. Regardless of prior cooling, the warming that will occur during packing makes essential final cooling to near 0°C following packing. Methyl bromide fumigation, if needed for quarantine treatment, should occur before cooling because warm fruit is less injured and fumigant doses are lower at warmer temperatures. "

abstract = "Gray mold, caused by Botrytis cinerea, is the main postharvest decay of table grapes. It can develop in the vineyard and spread rapidly among berries after harvest, during long distant transport, cold storage and shelf-life. In conventional agriculture, bunches are sprayed with fungicides after flowering, at pre-bunch closure, at veraison, and later, depending on the time of harvest. Harvested bunches are usually stored in the presence of sulfur dioxide. However, the use of synthetic fungicides and of sulfur dioxide is not allowed on organic grapes and the study of alternative methods to control postharvest decay has developed over several decades, along with the demand for safer storage methods. This review summarizes the results published in the field within the last 5 years (2006–2010). We can group these approaches as follows: (i) biocontrol agents; (ii) natural antimicrobials; (iii) \{GRAS\} type decontaminating agents; and (iv) physical means. Two biocontrol agents, Muscodor albus and Hanseniaspora uvarum, have shown equal or better effectiveness than conventional methods to control gray mold of table grapes in laboratory scale experiments. Currently, the bottleneck for the commercial use of biocontrol agents is that the registration process is comparable to that of fungicides, with similar costs but often with a narrower market. This delays their transition from experimental to practical use. Natural antimicrobials, such as salts, chitosan, and plant extracts, have demonstrated good results and often have been applied in various scales. Several GRAS-classified sanitizers have been tested to extend postharvest storage of table grapes, including acetic acid, electrolyzed oxidizing water, ozone, and ethanol. Physical technologies involving variations in temperature, UV-C irradiation, pressure or changing atmospheric composition, are all postharvest practices which require significant adaptation by an industry which is accustomed to minimal intervention during harvest. Overall, the use of ozone and of calcium chloride are two promising examples of treatments that are beginning to be adopted on a commercial scale. The requirements for the optimal treatment of grapes against gray mold before harvest or during storage are summarized. "

Mealiness did not develop until firmness dropped below approximately 20 N, whereas gel formation began to develop when firmness was as high as 35 N. Development of mealiness and loss of juiciness were correlated; however, slight mealiness was perceived when fruit were still considered juicy. Specific cultivar-related differences were evident in the changes in firmness and development of gel formation during and after cold storage. Fruit were less liked by the sensory panel when firmness dropped below 20 N, as juiciness decreased and mealiness and gel formation increased. Cell wall studies showed changes in yields of water-soluble and \{CDTA\} (trans-1,2-cyclohexanediamine tetraacetic acid)-soluble pectin. In fruit ripened after cold storage, mealiness and gel formation was accompanied by an increase in water-soluble pectin and an increase in CDTA-soluble pectin, whereas in apricots ripened straight after harvest, water-soluble pectin increased but CDTA-soluble pectin slightly decreased. All fruit, regardless of maturity or having chilling disorders or not, fitted the same correlation between firmness and uronic acid content of water-soluble pectin, but no pattern was evident for CDTA-soluble pectin. We concluded that the increasing solubilisation of pectin was a major feature of fruit softening in apricot, whereas the differences in CDTA-soluble pectin may reflect differences in strength of cell adhesion.

Optimum separation conditions are reported on six reversed-phase columns: Nucleosil 3 and 5 μm, 150(+20 guard)×4.0 mm; Gromsil 3 μm, 150(+10 guard)×4.0 mm; Hypersil 5 μm, 150(+20 guard)×4.0 mm and 200(+20 guard)×4.0 mm; and Hypersil 3 μm, 150(+20 guard)×4.0 mm. Elutions were followed, simultaneously, with photodiode array and fluorescence detectors connected in line. Optimization studies carried out in model solutions as a function of temperature (30–55°C) and eluent flow-rate (0.8–2.5 mL/min) demonstrated that optimum resolutions are obtained with the highest flow-rate applicable (remaining on the safe side with a column pressure of ≪3500 p.s.i.; 1 p.s.i.=6894.76 Pa) in the temperature range 30–50°C.

Normally, fruit start to soften, rot, and then lose commercial value after harvesting and being held at room temperature for a couple of weeks. Harvest has a great impact on yield, quality, and storage life. Harvesting too early will lead to poor quality and poor storage, whereas harvesting too late results in softening and quality deterioration, and reduces the market value of fruit that is overripe. Kiwifruit do not change color when ripe, so there is no way to determine their harvest time by color. Therefore, in the early phase of kiwifruit domestication and production, the soluble solids content (SSC) of green-fleshed fruit of A. chinensis var. deliciosa was developed as an index of harvest time. After a comprehensive evaluation of fruit quality and storage, \{SSC\} 6.2% was adopted as an accepted indicator of harvest maturity but better results in terms of flavor and storage life were obtained when fruit were harvested at 7–9% SSC. Recently, when yellow-fleshed kiwifruit of A. chinensis var. chinensis were domesticated for commercial production, the harvest index for yellow-fleshed kiwifruit was developed and recommended as when the hue angle is at or below 103°, the firmness at or below 39.2–49 N/cm2, dry matter 18–21%, and \{SSC\} is above 10%. The commercial processes after harvest include prestorage curing, presorting, grading, packing, storage, and ripening. Theoretical and practical aspects of each these process are briefly introduced. To prolong market supply, many storage methods have been developed for a long-term marketing supply, ranging from unsophisticated methods such as simple storage according to farmers’ traditional practices to modern refrigerated coolstores and \{CA\} storage with automatic control functions. The main factors in storage and \{CA\} storage parameters largely include cultivars, preharvest orchard management, precooling, storage temperature, humidity, \{O2\} and \{CO2\} concentration, and ethylene control, etc., and these are overviewed in the chapter. During kiwifruit storage, some disease occurs owing to contaminated fruit, physical damage, incorrect temperature, or other physiological disorders which seriously affect fruit quality, storage, and shelf life, or even result in a high percentage of fruit rotting. Caution and prevention must be paid to disease control during the storage and marketing supply chains. Important storage disorders of kiwifruit include carbon dioxide damage, kiwifruit soft rot, and kiwifruit penicilliosis; prevention measures are provided. "

Uninfested oranges were included in all fumigations to check for possible adverse effects. A 16-h fumigation at 20°C with an initial phosphine concentration of 0.98 g m−3 resulted in 96.4% mortality of fly larvae. This was a promising result but the mortality achieved was insufficient to meet mortality requirements for interstate (99.5%) or export trade (99.9%). Exposure times, temperatures and phosphine concentrations were all increased in subsequent fumigations. In the final series of fumigations with export grade Washington Navel oranges the exposure time was 48 h, thermostat settings for the chamber heater were 23 or 25°C, initial phosphine concentrations were 1.67 g m−3 and the concentrations were topped up to ∼0.7 g m−3 after 24 h. No adverse effects on the oranges were observed, and a mortality of 99.998% was achieved with &gt;48 000 larvae exposed. This would meet requirements for interstate trade and possibly also some international trade, particularly if incorporated as part of a systems approach. "

The strain is able to produce hydrolases, including glucanases, chitinases and proteases. The alkaline serine protease gene \{ALP5\} from A. pullulans was cloned, inserted into the vector pPIC9 to construct pPIC9/ALP5, and then expressed in Pichia pastoris strain KM71. \{ALP5\} had a molecular mass of 42.9 kDa after 5 days growth with 1% methanol induction at 28 °C. The recombinant protease expressed in P. pastoris showed its highest activity under alkaline conditions (at pH 10) and a temperature of 50 °C. The antifungal activity of the recombinant protease was investigated against Penicillium expansum, Botrytis cinerea, Monilinia fructicola and Alternaria alternata in vitro and on apple. The recombinant protease reduced significantly the spore germination and the germ tube length of the tested pathogens in \{PDB\} medium. The highest level of protease efficacy was observed against M. fructicola and B. cinerea, whereas a lower efficacy was observed against P. expansum and A. alternata indicating a possible effect of the pathogen cell wall composition on the proteolytic activity of the recombinant protease. The presence of protease was able to cause the swelling of the hyphae of B. cinerea, under an optical microscope. The recombinant protease expressed in P. pastoris was more active against the pathogens in vitro than the same enzyme expressed in E. coli in previous studies. The efficacy of \{ALP5\} was also evaluated against the pathogens in vivo on cv Golden Delicious apples. The protease was more efficient in controlling M. fructicola, B. cinerea and P. expansum than A. alternata. However, the extent of the activity was dependent on the enzyme concentration and the length of fruit storage. This study demonstrated the capacity of the alkaline serine protease to keep its enzymatic activity for some days in the unfavorable environment of the fruit wounds. The alkaline serine protease could be developed as a postharvest treatment with antimicrobial activity for fruit undergoing a short storage period. "

abstract = "Abstract Rotundone, the compound responsible for peppery aroma in red wines is positively correlated with the absence of water deficit during ripening which can make it problematic to produce red wines combining both superior concentrations in rotundone and phenolic compounds. To reach this double objective, on-vine drying with cutting of the fruit bearing cane or “Passerillage Éclaircissage sur Souche” (PES), a technique that consists in cutting the cane 2–3 weeks prior to harvest on a Guyot-trained vineyard was investigated combined or not with irrigation. We showed that \{PES\} had a limited impact on rotundone in wine. As the \{PES\} technique leads to an interruption of the sap flow, our results suggest that rotundone is synthesized in the berries and not translocated. A viticultural system combining irrigation and then \{PES\} induced significant gains in rotundone, in sugar concentration, in anthocyanins and in Total Phenolic Index in wine, and in skin to juice ratio. Measurements of bunch surface temperature indicate that the enhancement of rotundone production induced by irrigation is likely to be due to a direct rather than to an indirect effect through an increase in leaf area leading to a cooler bunch microclimate.

Ripening behaviour during 1 week at 20 °C was assessed at harvest and after 2. 4, 6, 8, 12, 16 and 20 weeks of storage at −0.5 °C. During ripening, the two cultivars showed distinctly different patterns of ethylene production after chilling. Ethylene production of ‘Buerre Bosc’ fruit followed typical climacteric patterns and generally exhibited progressively higher rates with longer storage. That of ‘Doyenne du Comice’ fruit increased with longer storage when initially transferred to higher temperature, but tended to decline during the ripening period. Ripening of fruit of both cultivars, as judged by physical measurements, was affected by harvest date and storage period. Early-harvested fruit required longer periods of storage before reaching full ripeness than late-harvested fruit (6 weeks cf. 2 weeks). Fruit still retained the ability to ripen fully after 20 weeks of storage. The extractable juice contents and titratable acidity concentrations of ripened fruit decreased with increasing storage, but these changes were less pronounced and occurred later than those for flesh firmness and background colour. Sensory analyses indicated that harvest date only affected eating quality of ‘Doyenne du Comice’ fruit. Fruit stored for 4–8 weeks generally had the highest flavour intensity, juiciness and overall quality. These results indicate that ‘Buerre Bosc’ fruit should be stored for a minimum of 4 weeks depending on harvest date, and best quality is obtained between 4 and 12 weeks after harvest. In contrast, optimum quality of ‘Doyenne du Comice’ fruit occurred between 8 and 20 weeks after harvest. "

However, these fungicides have been used in a manner highly conducive to the selection and proliferation of resistant biotypes of Penicillium digitatum, the main fruit decay fungus in the area. Recently, a new fungicide, pyrimethanil (PYR), was introduced to control molds. Aims of this study were to determine the baseline sensitivities for \{PYR\} against isolates of P. digitatum considering its use in the region is not yet widespread and to evaluate the control of the fungus in vivo. One hundred and nine (109) P. digitatum isolates were collected from diseased fruit within citrus groves (43 isolates) and packing houses (66 isolates). \{EC50\} was determined for each isolate by measuring colony diameters on different agar dilutions of the fungicide. The mean \{EC50\} value of the green mold isolates collected from the groves was 0.14 ± 0.03 mg L−1 while the mean \{EC50\} of those collected from packing houses was 0.13 ± 0.05 mg L−1. No resistant isolates were found in the field where the fungicide is not used, while one isolate originated from a packing house showed an \{EC50\} of 3.40 mg L−1, 26-fold higher than the mean level. This isolate was collected from lemons stored in cool rooms of a packing house where \{PYR\} had not been used. Fruit decay by sensitive isolates was reduced approximately 80% by \{PYR\} applied at 500–600 mg L−1 by immersion for 60 s at room temperature to inoculated oranges and mandarins. In contrast, the resistant isolate was not controlled by \{PYR\} applied at 1000 mg L−1. Thus, the introduction of \{PYR\} applied into packing houses should be done carefully and control strategies should be implemented in order to minimize the development of resistant isolates. "

The activities of cell wall modifying enzymes such as polygalacturonase (PG), pectin methyl esterase (PME), cellulase, β-galactosidase and antioxidant enzymes like peroxidase (POD), catalase (CAT) and ascorbic acid oxidase (AAO) were elucidated in the fruits of experimental sets and they were compared with that of control set. Fruits treated with \{SA\} and CaCl2 showed a significant (p &lt; 0.05) delay in changes of weight, total soluble solids (TSS), pH, titrable acidity (TA) and shelf life compared to untreated control fruits. The data of the present study may be an indicative that the lower enzyme activities of PG, PME, cellulase, β-galactosidase in the treated peppers might have been associated with a high integrity of the cell membrane and few changes in the cell wall constituents, which contributed to high levels of crispness and firmness in the peppers during storage. The higher activities of scavenger antioxidant enzymes, including \{POD\} and \{CAT\} in the treated peppers at the 18 days storage period are probably due to the effect of \{SA\} and CaCl2. In comparison to the fruits of control set, all the treatments have shown positive effectiveness on the inhibition of AAO. Also the results of the present study suggest that by using \{SA\} (1 mM and 2 mM) and CaCl2 (1.5%), the ripening process can be delayed, and the shelf life of capsicum fruits (stored at 10 °C) can be extended up to 71 days without any spoilage and off-flavour. Thus it may be concluded that the \{SA\} and CaCl2 treatments may aid in delaying the softening process, enhancing the keeping quality while retaining the nutritional quality of sweet peppers more than that of control fruits in both the storage conditions (25 °C and 10 °C).

No differences in firmness, acidity, and soluble solids content (SSC) were detected after cold storage between treatments. However, significant lower \{SSC\} levels were found in CaCl2- and NAA-treated fruits during cold storage, suggesting that these compounds could alter the normal breakdown of cell wall polysaccharides during postharvest. In this regard, CaCl2-treated fruit showed high contents of ionically-bound pectins and NAA-treated fruit exhibited low expression levels of endoglucanase gene (EG1) during cold storage. After cold storage, CaCl2, in combination with NAA, produced a reduction in the transcriptional level of polygalacturonase (PG1), pectate lyase (PL) and \{EG1\} genes. In contrast, an increase in the expression levels of pectin methylesterase (PE1) and xyloglucan endotransglycosylase/hydrolase (XTH1) genes was observed after cold storage in CaCl2- and NAA-treated fruits, respectively. In conclusion, calcium and auxin could individually alter fruit ripening preventing the normal degradation of cell wall during cold storage, while the combination of calcium and \{NAA\} reduce significantly the transcript level of important cell wall degrading genes after cold storage, albeit no differences in firmness were recorded.

abstract = "Abstract Peaches are popular, nutritious and widely consumed. Being a tree crop, it is considered a low risk fruit, with no direct water contact, and no previous foodborne disease outbreaks associated with its consumption. However, in 2014 the pioneer association between stone fruit and a foodborne illness was reported, linking Listeria monocytogenes to stone fruit. This highlights the need for better understanding of risk associated with contaminated fresh stone fruit, in order to implement adequate preventative measures. No information is available on the presence of foodborne pathogens on peaches in the supply chain. A case study approach was therefore followed to assess foodborne pathogen presence on the farm, focusing on the impact of irrigation water, facility sanitation and hygiene by collecting various fruit and environmental samples (n = 428). This study demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating basic microbial testing with safety management and risk assessment tools that can be collectively used to improve the food safety management system. No Salmonella Typhimurium was detected from samples, however, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria spp. and Staphylococcus aureus were detected on fruit and environmental samples. Despite the GlobalG.A.P. certification status of the farm, livestock frequented water sources which lead to E. coli O157:H7 contamination. This conclusion was based on positive detection of foodborne pathogens from the water sources and subsequent removal of livestock which resulted in a definite decrease in pathogen detection. A number of E. coli O157:H7 and S. aureus were detected during the second year of monitoring from environmental samples and it was observed that the personal hygiene and facility sanitation was not adequately enforced. Based on feedback given to the farmer, enforcement was improved and a definite decrease in foodborne pathogens was observed in the following sampling cycle. Areas of risk that were still identified following the fourth year of monitoring included the water source used for irrigation and poor sanitation in the production and processing facilities. Limited foodborne pathogen prevalence on peaches over the full study period as well as the extended export supply chain at controlled temperatures resulted in low-to-medium calculated consumer risk. The correct and meticulous implementation of integrated and holistic pre- and post-harvest food safety management systems is therefore essential to prevent produce contamination, reduce the consumer risk and therefore ensure overall product safety.

Cooling irrigation was applied continuously for 2 h on a daily basis for 25–30 days prior to commercial harvest. Three treatments were evaluated: (1) control without overtree microsprinkler irrigation; (2) microsprinkler irrigation applied at sunset; (3) microsprinkler irrigation applied at mid-day (year 2) or at sunrise (year 3). Fruit and orchard temperature were significantly reduced by cooling irrigation, especially when applied at mid-day and at sunset. Fruit colour, as measured with a Minolta CR-200 portable triestimulus colourimeter using the \{CIE\} [1976] L*a*b* system, and anthocyanin concentration were significantly affected by both the cooling irrigation and the weather of each specific year. The years 1998 and 1999 were warm years typical of the region and cooled fruits had better colour than in the control. In 1997, on the other hand, low temperatures and rainfall prior to harvest masked the effects of cooling irrigation on fruit colour and quality parameters. Microsprinkler irrigation, especially when applied at sunset, increased the red colour, providing greater surface colouration and higher anthocyanin content on both sides of the fruit. A linear regression of anthocyanin content on L*, a*/b* ratio and hue angle provided \{R2\} values of 0.58, 0.52 and 0.58, respectively. These values are low for estimating fruit anthocyanin content in situ from chromaticity values. Based on the colour required to meet \{EU\} grade standards, 13–22% more fruits were harvested at first pick from trees receiving cooling irrigation than from the control. Fruit firmness, fruit size, and soluble solid concentration (SSC) were all increased by cooling irrigation, though the extent to which this occurred varied from season to season. Significantly greater values were observed for cooled fruits than the control in 1998 and 1999 but not in 1997. On the other hand, titratable acidity (TA) did not appear to be consistently affected by evaporative cooling. The economical analysis evidences the interest of cooling, due mainly to increase of fruit colour, especially when the same system is used for both purposes, frost protection and cooling. "

Flesh browning incidence was lower in fruit stored at 2 °C than at 0 °C, but fruit were also softer and had lower titratable acidity (TA) at the higher storage temperature. All subsequent studies were carried out at 0 °C. High partial pressures of \{CO2\} (pCO2) of 2.5 kPa compared with &lt;1 kPa did not consistently affect flesh firmness, soluble solids concentration (SSC), and TA. The incidence of flesh browning was higher in more mature fruit and it was further aggravated by higher pCO2 in the storage atmosphere, irrespective of pO2, while watercore disappearance was more rapid at &lt;1 kPa \{CO2\} than at 2.5 kPa CO2. Flesh browning was also higher at 1.5 kPa \{CO2\} than at &lt;1 kPa CO2, although ethylene production was lowest at 1.5 kPa pCO2. Stepwise delay of high \{CO2\} or low \{O2\} \{CA\} storage did not affect flesh firmness, TA, internal ethylene concentration, respiration rate, and ethylene production, but watercore disappearance was more rapid, compared with standard \{CA\} storage at 2 months. Flesh browning was not detected in the stepwise \{CO2\} delayed \{CA\} treatment and low \{CO2\} \{CA\} storage (&lt;0.2 kPa CO2), but a low (&lt;4%) incidence of flesh browning was found in a delayed \{CA\} treatment and standard \{CA\} storage. These results indicate that ‘Fuji’ apples could be stored at 0 °C in 1–2 kPa O2/&lt;1 kPa \{CO2\} if harvested at less than 190 days after full bloom. Stepwise \{CO2\} delay \{CA\} or low \{CO2\} \{CA\} storage regimes are recommended to retard the loss of fruit quality factors and reduce development of CA-related storage disorders. "

abstract = "The mature longan fruit (Dimocarpus longan Lour.) is small (ca. 1.5–2 cm diameter), conical, heart-shaped or spherical in shape and light brown in colour. It has a thin, leathery and indehiscent pericarp surrounding a succulent, edible white aril. The aril contains a relatively large dark brown seed. Maturity can be determined on the basis of fruit weight, skin colour, flesh sugar concentration, flesh acid concentration, sugar:acid ratio, flavour and/or days from anthesis. Longan fruit are non-climacteric with little change in soluble solids concentration (SSC) or titratable acidity (TA) after harvest. Longan fruit deteriorate rapidly unless proper handling techniques are employed. The major factors reducing the storage life and marketability of longan fruit are microbial decay and pericarp browning. Low temperature storage at 1–5 °C is used to reduce pathological decay, but has a only limited role in reducing pericarp browning. Moreover, the fruit deteriorate rapidly when removed from cold storage. Under refrigeration, longan fruit have a storage life of approximately 30 days. Pulp quality and disease development are generally stable during cold storage until such time as fruit become visually unacceptable from pericarp browning. Sulfur dioxide fumigation has been the most effective postharvest treatment for control of pericarp browning in longan fruit, and is used extensively in commercial situations at present. However, there is increasing consumer and regulatory resistance to the use of this chemical. Insect disinfestation has become increasingly important with the expanding export market. Irradiation and heat treatments for insect disinfestation of longan fruit have been found to be alternatives to treatment with insecticides. Recent research has focused on reducing these major postharvest problems in order to produce light-coloured, chemical-free fruit without disease or insect infestation. "

Pyrimethanil at low concentration (40 μg/mL) alone had little inhibitory activity against the P. expansum infection in pear fruit wounds although it was effective in inhibiting the survival of P. expansum on Asp-agar medium. Pyrimethanil at this low concentration significantly enhanced the efficacy of Cryptococcus laurentii at 1 × 107 CFU/mL in reducing blue mold rot in vivo compared with C. laurentii at 1 × 107 CFU/mL alone. However, there was no additive inhibitory activity when pyrimethanil was combined for application with biocontrol yeasts Rhodosporidium paludigenum or Rhodotorula glutinis. Combination of pyrimethanil and C. laurentii at low concentration also inhibited blue mold rot when P. expansum was inoculated into fruit wounds 12 h before treatment and fruit was stored at low temperature (4 °C). Pyrimethanil at 0.04 to 400 μg/mL did not influence the survival of C. laurentii in vitro, and it only slightly reduced the population growth of C. laurentii after 48 h of incubation in the pear fruit wounds. There was no significant difference in quality parameters including total soluble solids, titratable acidity and ascorbic acid of pear fruit wounds among all treatments after 5 days of treatment at 25 °C. Integration of C. laurentii and pyrimethanil at low concentration might be an effective and safe strategy to control P. expansum infection in pear fruit, especially in an integrated postharvest disease management strategy.

Phloem, xylem and transpiration flows to/from the berry were continuously monitored for several days at about 5, 9, 11 and 15 weeks after full bloom (WAFB), on two consecutive years, while air temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation and rain were simultaneously recorded. From these data vapour pressure deficit (VPD) was also calculated. For each period considered, the daily amounts and the daily patterns of kiwifruit berry relative growth rate (RGR) and vascular flows were compared between two subsequent days having high (HVPD) and low (LVPD) mean VPDs, respectively. During all periods, daily water exchanges were linearly related to \{VPD\} although these relationships showed decreasing slopes during the season. At 5 and 9 \{WAFB\} daily and hourly rates of xylem and transpiration flows were highly reduced by \{LVPD\} conditions, while phloem flow was not affected by such changes during the whole season. Also, \{LVPD\} conditions affected the typical daily fluctuations in the berry \{RGR\} by reducing its morning shrinkage and slowing down its afternoon growth rates. This study shows how in the early stages of kiwifruit berry growth, weather worsening highly reduces the berry water exchanges by xylem and transpiration, but does not affect its phloem imports in the short-period.

In this study, the efficacy of UV-B/visible irradiation was evaluated under high- (27 °C) and low-temperature (17 °C) conditions using red Chinese sand pear ‘Yunhongli No. 1’ as a model. The results showed that UV-B/visible irradiation was more effective in inducing anthocyanin synthesis in peel tissues and improving fruit coloration at 27 °C than at 17 °C. \{PAL\} activity was markedly higher at 27 °C than at 17 °C. Expression of PyMYB10 and five anthocyanin structural genes, PpPAL, PpCHI, PpCHS, PpF3H, and PpANS, was also higher in fruit irradiated at 27 °C than in fruit irradiated at 17 °C. For PpUFGT, transcription reached a maximum at 48 and 240 h after the onset of irratiation at 27 °C and 17 °C, respectively, but the peak value was lower at 27 °C than at 17 °C.

Sugar composition of the alcohol-insoluble carbohydrate residue was also analyzed during ripening. Galactose (10%) was the major sugar followed by arabinose (4.2%). The amount of the neutral sugar which was initially 25% decreased to 15% during ripening, resulting in a nearly 40% loss; the changes mainly involved reduction in galactosyl and arabinosyl residues.

The model consists of modules for greenhouse light transmission, light interception by the crop, leaf and canopy photosynthesis, assimilate partitioning, dry matter production, fruit growth, fruit dry matter content and fruit harvest. A sensitivity analysis showed the total yield to increase with increasing radiation, \{CO2\} concentration and temperature. The harvest strategy of the grower (frequency of harvesting and threshold weight for harvest) had a great impact on simulated fruit size and fruit developmental stage at harvest. The latter was lowest in summer time, which may have consequences for the shelf life of the fruits. The model was validated by comparing simulation results with production data of 10 commercial growers in 1996 and 14 growers in 1997 (January–May). Input data used for validation were week numbers of planting and removing the crop, weekly data on global radiation outside the glasshouse and glasshouse air temperature and daytime \{CO2\} concentration. The weekly harvest of total fresh weight averaged over all growers was simulated well by the model. The average error of the weekly prediction of the fresh weight yield was 12.6%, while the error of the annual yield was only 0.3% in 1996. The simulated average fruit size corresponded reasonably well with growers' data, showing an average weekly error of 6.6%. The accuracy of prediction of cucumber yields largely depends on accuracy of the weather prediction. "

Fruit surface temperature (FST) thresholds for \{SI\} related disorders have been developed but there are no thresholds established for solar radiation. The objective of the study was to measure the effect of different levels of FST, \{PAR\} and \{UV\} on quantum efficiency (Fv/Fm) alone and in combination to identify interactions affecting Fv/Fm recovery to serve as a guideline in evaluating SI-prevention technology. The variable transmission of UVb, UVa, PAR, and \{NIR\} through films of Surround™ and Raynox™ provided a wide range of radiation levels at the fruit surface to model Fv/Fm of photosystem \{II\} (PSII) in growth chamber and greenhouse studies. Increasing \{UV\} and \{PAR\} reduced Fv/Fm the greatest amount in ‘Gala’ while ‘Granny Smith’ had the least reduction suggesting that \{PSII\} in ‘Granny Smith’ has higher \{UV\} and \{PAR\} tolerance. All cultivars except ‘Fuji’ at harvest had some interaction component of \{PAR\} and \{UV\} that decreased Fv/Fm compared to untreated control fruit as both \{PAR\} and \{UV\} increased. When re-exposure was conducted on the 5 cultivars, Fv/Fm further decreased with the cumulative \{PAR\} and \{UV\} despite having a period of dark recovery between each 24 h exposure. Cultivar differences have a strong influence on the sensitivity of the peel to \{FST\} and radiation levels. Cultivars differ in their response to FST, \{UV\} and \{PAR\} as they mature and also exhibit year-to-year variation. This inconsistency suggests that acclimation to the environment also varies between years. \{PAR\} × \{UV\} interactions are complex and include the acclimation of the cultivar to the stress but in the prevention of SI, reducing FST, \{PAR\} and \{UV\} simultaneously is likely the most effective strategy.

Susceptibility to \{FD\} was low at harvest but increased with storage, especially between 1 and 2 months storage. Concomitantly, higher coating concentrations were required to reduced \{FD\} with prolonged storage; coating concentrations of 20 and 40% were necessary to reduce \{FD\} for fruit damaged after 1 and 2 months storage, respectively. Increasing coating concentration reduced internal \{O2\} partial pressure and reduced water loss. The lower internal \{O2\} level in coated fruit was associated with delayed ripening and reduced fruit susceptibility to FD. Reduced water loss preserved the integrity of skin and reduced susceptibility to FD. Higher levels of \{FD\} were observed at temperatures lower or higher than 10–20°C. The physical protection provided by skin coatings in combination with their effects on fruit physiology, presents a useful opportunity to reduce \{FD\} after cold storage, if adopted in conjunction with adequate temperature and humidity control during storage and post-storage handling of the fruit.

The effect of two different bag types used inside the carton was also tested; a high density polyethylene perforated bag used commercially to package grapes, and a low-density polyethylene insect-proof bag with much smaller perforations. Respiration rates and ethylene production were determined at various time points during the trial, and quality parameters such as hue angle, shrivel, flesh firmness, decay and gel breakdown were measured throughout the process. The results indicated that the respiration rate of the fruit generally increased as the irradiation dose increased, except after shelf-life where it decreased after reaching a maximum at 400 Gy. Even at the highest dose most of the quality parameters measured at the end of cold storage were above the minimum arrival standards for overseas markets, except for shrivel, a condition that is common in the ‘Flavor Fall’ cultivar. Shrivel was higher than the maximum allowed, and although fruit contained in the insect-proof bags had half the amount of shrivel than fruit in the commercial bag, it was still above the maximum 10% allowed for export fruit. After further optimization of the approach, a system using insect-proof bags and irradiation would be an effective non-toxic alternative to currently used mitigation treatments for plums. "

This physiological disorder is manifest as extensive collapsed and dry areas of the flavedo (outer coloured part of the peel), and part of the albedo (inner part of the peel), that becomes dark with time. In the present study we have examined the effect of humidity, temperature and applying ethylene to harvested fruit on the abscisic acid (ABA) content in the flavedo and on their susceptibility to develop rindstaining. The incidence of this physiological disorder was considerably reduced by treating the fruit with ethylene or by keeping them at low temperature (2 °C) but was enhanced by increasing the relative humidity (RH) during storage at 22 °C. Fruit treated with air and kept at 22 °C under low \{RH\} (55–60%) had higher \{ABA\} contents than fruit kept under high \{RH\} (85–90%) at the beginning of the storage period. However, after 14 days storage little difference in \{ABA\} content between fruit held under both treatments was found and the rindstaining index of fruit was different. The beneficial effect of keeping the fruit at 2 °C appeared to be more related to the influence of low temperature on delaying the mechanism of peel pitting than to the changes occurring in \{ABA\} content in the flavedo of fruit. Ethylene induced a sharp increase in \{ABA\} content in the flavedo and considerably reduced rindstaining. However, no differences in ethylene-induced \{ABA\} levels were found despite the efficacy of ethylene in controlling rindstaining increasing with concentration of gas applied and duration of the treatment. The overall results indicate that ethylene, but not ABA, may be an important factor protecting ‘Navelina’ fruit from the development of rindstaining. "

Although the use of shading screens is a common, although expensive, strategy to minimize the impact of thermal stress, the use of grafting onto adequate rootstocks could be an interesting alternative to maintain commercial fruit yield and quality under non-shaded conditions, in addition to providing other advantages such as resistance to soil-borne diseases. In order to test this hypothesis, we studied the behaviour of ‘Herminio’ plants ungrafted and grafted onto three different commercial rootstocks (Atlante, Creonte and Terrano) under non-shaded and shaded conditions. The use of shading screen proved to be efficient in improving vegetative growth, photosynthesis, transpiration and leaf water status, and for reducing the unmarketable yield, especially the incidence of the sunscalded fruits, compared to non-shaded conditions. In general, the grafted plants performed better than the ungrafted ones under both growing conditions, but the differences were more evident under non-shaded conditions. The plants grafted onto Atlante produced up to 40% more leaf area than the other combinations but did not increase yield nor reduce the incidence of the sunscald disorder. However, grafting onto Creonte did not significantly affect leaf biomass but increased the total and marketable fruit yield by 30% and 50% under non-shaded and shaded conditions compared to the ungrafted plants, respectively. Moreover, this rootstock maintained 30–60% higher leaf photosynthetic activity and reduced the amount of sunscalded fruits by 6% during the harvest period in non-shaded conditions. However some fruit nutritional parameters were affected. These results suggest that improved protection of the photosynthetic apparatus is more efficient for increasing yield and for reducing sunscald disorder than more foliage per se under non-shaded conditions, in the absence of any other imposed stress. The use of the rootstock Creonte is an efficient alternative to using shading screens in greenhouse-grown sweet peppers. "

abstract = "Sweet pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) is one of the most important fruit crops in Israel and other Mediterranean countries. Various pepper-importing countries, such as the USA, demand quarantine security protocols to diminish the risk of accidental introduction of the Mediterranean fruit fly (medfly) Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann) on imported fruit. Effective quarantine treatment protocols must combine complete insect kill, minimal damage to plant tissue, and reasonable cost. Recently, we developed a method for the successful artificial infestation of sweet pepper fruit with medfly eggs, and improved this protocol to allow medfly larvae to proceed to the L1, \{L2\} and \{L3\} stages, and then to subject them to cold-treatments tests. Our results showed that all tested stages (egg, L1, \{L2\} and L3) were totally killed by simulated in-transit cold quarantine treatments at 1.5 °C or 4 °C for 21 d, which represents an average ship journey from Israel to distant markets such as Japan or the USA. Based on emerging pupae in the control, average numbers of viable organisms under the different treatments were approx. 6235 eggs, and 1000–1250 organisms in each of the treatments with advanced stages (L1–L3). These two cold quarantine treatments, especially the one at 1.5 °C, caused very little chilling redcution in fruit quality of the bag-packed pepper fruit, i.e., chilling injury complied with a commercially required reasonable level of overall quality. In contrast, unbagged peppers suffered significantly higher chilling injury than bagged ones, with accelerated decay and water loss. In conclusion, our results provide the basis for the future establishment of an export quarantine treatment protocol for bell pepper fruit. It should be based on in-transit storage at temperatures of 1.5 °C for 21 d to eliminate the medfly eggs and larval instars from pepper fruit while maintaining the commercial quality of the fruit. "

A protocol for the computer-controlled application of gaseous \{SO2\} has been developed which allows the application of very low specific concentration × time products of \{SO2\} and simultaneous monitoring of the application progress. In vitro tests with important fungal, yeast and bacterial postharvest pathogens plated on Petri dishes and exposed to a \{SO2\} concentration × time product (C × t) of 100 (μL/L) h at different temperatures showed fewer survived at 20 °C than at 0 °C. Therefore, fumigations were carried out at 20 °C in the rest of the experiments. The evaluation of different \{SO2\} concentration × time products showed that a product of 25 (μL/L) h provided the best compromise between decay control and fruit injury. The performance of \{SO2\} fumigations on warm or cold fruit, its combination with \{SO2\} generating pads, and the use of repeated fumigations during cold storage were also evaluated. All the \{SO2\} treatments tested reduced the percentage of decay, extending the market life of fresh figs. However, in some cases, the use of \{SO2\} generating pads increased the incidence of skin bleaching. Fumigation of warm fruit at 25 (μL/L) h of \{SO2\} reduced populations of Alternaria and Rhizopus spp. growing on the fig surface. The treatment was more effective against Rhizopus spp. than against Alternaria spp. Contamination of fruit by Botrytis spp. and Penicillium spp. was also reduced by SO2. In conclusion, results showed that \{SO2\} can be a potential tool to control postharvest rots and therefore increase the market life of fresh figs. "

The model accounts for the actual shape of the strawberry, surface decontamination kinetics and temperature-related product quality objectives. Conduction heat transfer was coupled with a first-order kinetic model for microbial inactivation at the surface of strawberries. The thermophysical properties were estimated based on the chemical composition of strawberries, and the inactivation properties of Botrytis cinerea were used. The heat transfer model was validated based on immersion experiments of strawberries in pure water at different temperatures. The effect of different periodic heating cycles on the internal temperature distribution was expressed by means of a thermal product state functional, in which temperature increases were exponentially penalised. Computer simulations revealed that heating cycles with a small period length minimise the overall product temperature increase and, hence, reduce the level of quality losses. In this way large temperature variations are limited to the product boundary. This model-based approach provides a postharvest engineering tool for design and fine tuning of surface decontamination processes and equipment. "

Fruit with sunburn are predisposed to develop postharvest disorders and need to be separated from the fruit considered for mid to long-term storage. In order to identify specific characteristics for non-invasive, automatic selection of fruit with sunburn, the effect of sunburn on external and internal features on sunlit and shaded fruit sides was assessed in ‘Granny Smith’, ‘Fuji’ and ‘Braeburn’ cultivars. It has been shown that shaded sides of apple with and without sunburn generally do not differ in their internal fruit quality characteristics, Lab colour readings and chlorophyll fluorescence intensities. With sunlit fruit sides, sunburn induced changes in Lab values are cultivar specific. The common feature of fruit with sunburn in all tested cultivars is a greater difference between fruit firmness and soluble solids content on shaded and sunlit sides as compared to unaffected fruit. Due to the chlorophyll breakdown in the affected areas, laser-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (LIF) is proposed as an appropriate sensitive technique for the reliable sunburn detection in green and red apple cultivars.

Populations of Bacillus and disease incidence were monitored weekly from harvested fruit over an 18-week period. Population levels of Bacillus ranged from 75 to 110 × 104 colony forming units (cfu) cm−2 of fruit surface area one week after application to 25–30 × 104 cfu cm−2 of fruit surface area 4 weeks after application. Disease incidence on harvested fruit incubated at 21 °C for 7–10 days was variable, due to variation in inoculum levels within the greenhouse as well as variable environmental conditions. Both disease incidence and severity were significantly reduced on Rhapsody-treated fruit, especially in the 1–2 week period following application. Post-harvest storage temperature (13 °C vs. 21 °C) and incubation time (12 vs. 16 days) had a significant effect on final disease severity. Rhapsody-treated fruit incubated at 13 °C had an average of 1–2% fruit infection compared to up to 20% infection on untreated fruit at 21 °C. The most frequent pathogens affecting fruit quality were Penicillium sp. and Rhizopus stolonifer. Rhapsody applications made every 4 weeks maintained sufficiently high populations of Bacillus on the fruit surface to prevent spread of these fungi onto the fruit, resulting in significant post-harvest disease control on fresh market tomatoes. When combined with storage at 13 °C for no more than 12 days, disease was reduced to negligible levels. "

This is an area where irrigation is the only source of water for agricultural crops in the summer growing season. A two-year field study was conducted to assess plant water stress using infrared canopy temperature measurements and to examine its feasibility for managing postharvest deficit irrigation of peach trees. Twelve infrared temperature sensors were installed in a mature peach orchard which received four irrigation treatments: furrow and subsurface drip irrigation with or without postharvest water stress. During the two-year period, measured midday canopy to air temperature differences in the water-stressed postharvest deficit irrigation treatments were in the 5–7 °C range, which were consistently higher than the 1.4–2 °C range found in the non-water-stressed control treatments. A reasonable correlation (R2 = 0.67–0.70) was obtained between stem water potential and the canopy to air temperature difference, indicating the possibility of using the canopy temperature to trigger irrigation events. Crop water stress index (CWSI) was estimated and consistently higher \{CWSI\} values were found in the deficit irrigation than in the control treatments. Results of yield and fruit quality assessments were consistent with the literature when deficit irrigation was deployed. "

The \{MA\} packages were made from laminates of bi-axially oriented polypropylene (BOPP) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) in order to meet the gas transmission requirements of the fruit. A package size of 28 cm × 22 cm was finalized for 1 kg ± 100 g fill-weight of fruit. A mathematical model for \{MA\} packaging of fruit applying a respiration equation based on enzyme kinetics coupled with the Arrhenius model was developed. The model was solved numerically using \{MATLAB\} and the models efficiently predicted the time to reach equilibrium and levels of \{O2\} and \{CO2\} at equilibrium with E values in the range of 5.92–8.60% and 7.14–9.35%, respectively. Different quality attributes such as physiological weight loss, volume reduction, firmness, total soluble solids, titratable acidity, color parameters, polyphenoloxidase and peroxidase values and anthocyanin contents were determined at regular intervals. Sensory attributes such as color, texture, taste and mouth feel of fruit samples were evaluated using fuzzy logic. The \{MAP\} system increased the shelf-life of litchi fruit by 100–150% that of unpacked fruit at various storage temperatures with a quality comparable with freshly harvested fruit. Fruit stored in \{MAP\} retained quality up to 17, 13 and 9 d of storage at 10, 15 and 20 °C, respectively. \{MAP\} of EDTA-treated fruit resulted in a reduction of weight loss, prevention of browning, and retention of good color and sweet taste during extended storage. The direct effect as well as a two and three factor interaction of the effects of temperature, packaging system and storage periods were found to have significant effects on quality parameters of fruit at the 1% level of significance.

Rates of ethylene production were also low (0.2–2.0 nl g−1 h−1 at 20°C) for immature and mature fruits. Ripening and ripe fruits (horticulturally over-mature) showed much higher rates of ethylene production (20–40 nl g−1 h−1) than developing fruits. Storage of fruits at 10°C and 20°C resulted in greater weight loss and color change than storage at lower temperatures. The freshness of the husks was also maintained at lower temperatures. Storage at 2.5°C for 3 weeks resulted in higher decay levels and surface pitting than storage at 5°C. Decay incidence was decreased by a chlorinated water wash before storage. "

To reduce the losses, an alternative is to dry the product. In this context, the main objective of this article was to describe the thin-layer drying of whole bananas. To describe the convective drying process, a mathematical model is normally used. In this article, several empirical models were selected to simulate experiments of thin layer drying accomplished with whole bananas at temperatures of 40, 50, 60 and 70 °C. In the selection, it was imposed that mathematical expressions must be obtained from each model to calculate the drying rate and also the process time. The process time ranged from 1200 (70 °C) up to 3265 (40 °C) min. The maximum drying rate occurs at the beginning of the process and varied between 1.95 × 10−3 (40 °C) and 3.60 × 10−3 (70 °C) min−1. The statistical indicators (determination coefficient and chi-square) showed that Page and Silva et alii models were the best ones to describe the drying kinetics. These two empirical equations enable to write mathematical expressions for the drying rate and process time, and these expressions produced results which can be considered equivalent. "

The results showed that both stresses induced CpP5CS2 expression during the storage period, and the increased expression of CpP5CS2 preceded proline accumulation. In addition, the high temperature caused a more significant induction of CpP5CS2 expression and a higher level of accumulated proline than low temperature. "

abstract = "Organic acids are present in all plants, supporting numerous and varied facets of cellular metabolism. The type of organic acid found, and the levels to which they accumulate are extremely variable between species, developmental stages and tissue types. Acidity plays important roles in the organoleptic properties of plant tissues, where examples of both enhanced and reduced palatability can be ascribed to the presence of specific organic acids. In fruits, sourness is generally attributed to proton release from acids such as citric, malic, oxalic, quinic, succinic and tartaric, while the anion forms each contribute a distinct taste. Acidity imposes a strong influence on crop quality, and is an important factor in deciding the harvest date, particularly for fruits where acidity is important for further processing, as in wine grapes. In the grape, as for many other fruits, malate is one of the most prevalent acids, and is an important participant in numerous cellular functions. The accumulation of malate is thought to be due in large part to de novo synthesis in fruits such as the grape, through metabolism of assimilates translocated from leaf tissues, as well as photosynthetic activity within the fruit itself. During ripening, the processes through which malate is catabolised are of interest for advancing metabolic understanding, as well as for potential crop enhancement through agricultural or molecular practices. A body of literature describes research that has begun to unravel the regulatory mechanisms of enzymes involved in malate metabolism during fruit development, through exploration of protein and gene transcript levels. Datasets derived from a series of recent microarray experiments comparing transcript levels at several stages of grape berry development have been revisited, and are presented here with a focus on transcripts associated with malate metabolism. Developmental transcript patterns for enzymes potentially involved in grape malate metabolism have shown that some flux may occur through pathways that are less commonly regarded in ripening fruit, such as aerobic ethanol production. The data also suggest pyruvate as an important intermediate during malate catabolism in fruit. This review will combine an analysis of microarray data with information available on protein and enzyme activity patterns in grapes and other fruits, to explore pathways through which malate is conditionally metabolised, and how these may be controlled in response to developmental and climatic changes. Currently, an insufficient understanding of the complex pathways through which malate is degraded, and how these are regulated, prevents targeted genetic manipulation aimed at modifying fruit malate metabolism in response to environmental conditions.

The fruit of the wax apple is fragile, non-climacteric with a short shelf life. Water loss is a big problem for wax apple storage so to keep the moisture and decrease the perishing process, modified atmosphere packaging with temperatures between 10 to 12 °C is recommended for the storage of wax apple fruits.

Eggplants or aubergines (Solanum melongena L.) are among the top vegetables in terms of antioxidant content. In this work, we evaluated the effect of two postharvest temperature regimes on deterioration and antioxidants of dark purple American eggplants (cv. Lucía). Fruit were stored at 0 or 10 °C for 0, 3, 5, 10 or 14 d and weight loss, electrolyte leakage, chilling injury, and pulp browning were evaluated. We also followed \{DPPH\} and Folin–Ciocalteu reacting substances and the content of chlorogenic and quinic acid by HPLC. Although weight loss was reduced in fruit held at 0 °C, higher electrolyte leakage and chilling injury manifested as surface scalds and pulp browning were found. Antioxidants (AOX) measured with the \{DPPH\} radical and with the Folin–Ciocalteu reagent increased during the first 3 d of storage at 0 °C, but afterwards significant degradation was found. In contrast, a gradual but continuous accumulation of \{AOX\} was detected in fruit stored at 10 °C. The slow rate in the reaction between \{DPPH\} and eggplant samples suggested that the main changes during postharvest storage were due to modifications in phenolic compounds. The major phenolic detected by \{HPLC\} was chlorogenic acid (ChA), an ester between caffeic (CA) and quinic acids (QA), which accumulated in fruit maintained at 10 °C, increasing by 60% after 14 d of storage. No free \{CA\} was found at any storage temperature or time, suggesting that its biosynthesis is activated simultaneously with the production of ChA. Free \{QA\} showed minor changes at 0 °C as pulp lightness decreased, indicating that ChA rather than \{CA\} may be the main substrate for browning reactions. Changes in eggplant fruit antioxidants during storage at chilling and non-chilling temperatures are discussed. "

Cucumbers were cold shocked at different temperatures (0, 3, 6 °C) for different durations (20, 40, 60 min), and their preservation quality was evaluated by the proposed models. Results show that, the evaluation model can objectively evaluate preservation quality of cold shocked cucumber, and cold shocked at 3 °C for 40 min gets optimal preservation effect. Cold shock treatments at 0 °C and 3 °C improve preservation quality of cucumber effectively, while that at 6 °C fails. Therefore, entropy change caused by cold shock treatment should be higher than a certain critical value to improve preservation quality of cucumber effectively, and the duration is crucial for preservation quality when meeting this condition. The composite entropy change (S*) shows effect of both temperature and duration and characterizes cold shock intensity, and proposed prediction model of cold shock preservation quality can predict preservation quality of cucumber cold shocked at different temperatures and durations well. Industrial relevance Fresh fruits and vegetables contain rich essential substances to our bodies and play an active role in improving people's health. Since it has obvious seasonal regional characteristics on the fruits and vegetables production, pretreatment is very important for prolonging their storage periods. Cold shock treatment for many fruits and vegetables indicate that this method can effectively improve their preservation quality and have broad application space. This study lies in providing a series of methods based on entropy to characterize the cold shock intensity to fruits and vegetables, carrying out objective quantitative evaluation and prediction for preservation quality of the cold shock treatment, and based on which, the influence mechanism of cold shock intensity (temperature and duration) on preservation quality of fruits and vegetables was analyzed. The results will contribute to better design and optimization of the cold shock process for postharvest fruits storage. "

After storage for 60 d at 3 or 7 °C, under 90% R.H., fruits were evaluated visually for incidence of epidermal and subepidermal peteca. At that time, the concentration of galacturonic acid and degree of methylation were measured in the albedo, and calcium, hydrogen peroxides and total oxalate concentrations, peroxidase and polyphenoloxidase (PPO) activities were determined in the juice and albedo. Yellow lemons at 3 °C developed more epidermal peteca than fruit stored at 7 °C, and that silver fruit stored at 3 and 7 °C, with these last lemons presenting a higher pectin quality than fruit stored at 3 °C. Maturity and temperature interacted significantly on the concentrations of peroxide and calcium in the albedo, which in average were much higher than in the juice, while for \{PPO\} and peroxidases, this interaction was highly significant both in juice and albedo, with higher activity in the albedo. These biochemical evaluations suggest that peteca is a result of some kind of stress on the fruit. It is concluded that yellow lemons are more prone to develop peteca than silver fruit. They will develop greater incidence of the disorder when stored at temperatures as low as 3 °C for 60 d, and that this condition affects the degree of methylation in the albedo, which would end up altering the quality of pectins.

Chillies and peppers are susceptible to water loss that occurs through the calyx, pedicel, and skin surface. Flux through the skin is influenced by cuticular cracking, a common physical defect for Jalapeño. A high incidence of cracking was found.to be caused by harvest date, with those fruit developed early in the season having the highest incidence. Although cracks developed corky suberisation, fluorescence microscopy showed the central portion of the cracks was unsuberised. The water vapour permeance (mol s−1 m−2 Pa−1) of cracked Jalapeño was approximately three times higher than non-cracked fruit. However, the calyx and pedicel of Jalapeño were found to exhibit higher water vapour permeance than fruit skin for both cracked and non-cracked Jalapeño. After accounting for the surface area of each structure, the majority of water is lost via the fruit skin in cracked fruit, while water is equally lost from fruit skin and stem area (calyx and pedicel) in non-cracked fruit. A model was developed to predict Jalapeño shelf life (assuming that 5% water loss resulted in shrivel development) and used to conduct a sensitivity analysis on factors that influence time to shrivel development. Fruit weight and P ′ H 2 O differences in the population had little effect on time to shrivel development. Cracking does reduce time to shrivel significantly but storage temperature and \{RH\} have such a big impact that water loss in Jalapeño remains best controlled through good cool chain management and packaging.

For yellow-fleshed kiwifruit, the flesh colour is a significant quality attribute, and for ‘Hort16A’, flesh colour has been used for timing harvest. Variability in the postharvest performance of ‘Hort16A’ kiwifruit suggests that flesh colour alone is not as strongly indicative of postharvest performance as soluble solids content (SSC) was found to be for ‘Hayward’ kiwifruit 30 years ago. The postharvest performance of ‘Hort16A’ kiwifruit, assessed as the fruit firmness and chilling injury expression during storage, has been associated with a range of fruit characteristics: flesh colour, SSC, firmness, seed colour, fresh weight, dry matter, starch and soluble carbohydrates measured at harvest throughout maturation. The changing responses of the fruit \{SSC\} to temperature, and softening to ethylene, have also been determined. The data illustrate the complex nature of ‘Hort16A’ fruit maturation, even when looking only at simple, easy-to-measure fruit attributes. While a yellow flesh colour is a commercial necessity for ‘Hort16A’ kiwifruit, flesh colour is not a robust indicator of postharvest performance and is not tightly linked to \{SSC\} or firmness. Changes in the capacity of fruit to respond to temperature or ethylene are not reflected in on-vine changes. Softening in storage is strongly linked to the softening rate occurring on the vine at the time of harvest. Any association between at-harvest characteristics and chilling susceptibility is less clear, and chilling tolerance appears more associated with the completion of growth and carbohydrate accumulation than with increased soluble solids accumulation rates as in ‘Hayward’. Approaches to extend the understanding of the link between maturation, harvest indices and postharvest performance are discussed. "

Penicillium expansum is a post-harvest pathogen that colonises these fruit during storage, having penetrated the fruit through wounds incurred at harvest. The fungus macerates the host tissue during the long periods of storage and simultaneously accumulates significant amounts of the mycotoxin patulin. Fungal decay is a concern for both retailers and consumers, due to the presence of mycotoxins that may appear in fresh fruit as well in their derived products, and patulin levels are therefore monitored. Patulin is a toxic secondary metabolite resulting from enzymatic pathway cascades and recently, the full gene cluster involved in the synthesis of this mycotoxin has been described. However, the factors and inducers modulating its synthesis are still not clear, although several environmental factors, including pH, temperature and cultivar, have been suggested to contribute to patulin accumulation. Nevertheless, in most cases, it was concluded that patulin may result from fungal stress (temperature, O2, organic acid or carbon), which stimulates its production. The contribution of patulin to colonisation is still not clear; recent studies have suggested that it is involved in disease aggressiveness, indicating that disease control may be the main way to reduce patulin accumulation. In this review, we will analyse, based on recent biological data, the possible factors modulating the production of patulin by P. expansum and their contribution to colonisation of deciduous fruit. "

The two antagonists were selected after preliminary assays for their ability to reduce brown rot in peaches and nectarines, and both were identified by molecular and morphological tools as Aureobasidium pullulans. In in vivo trials, neither the autoclaved cells, nor the sterile culture filtrates of either antagonist showed any significant reduction of rot incidence produced by inocula of the three Monilinia species, while the washed cells of \{L1\} and \{L8\} completely inhibited M. laxa and M. fructicola rots and reduced M. fructigena infections by 70% and 90%, respectively. In other trials, nectarines treated with antagonist cells and inoculated with the pathogens were stored at 0 °C for 21 days, plus 7 days at 20 °C. The low temperature reduced brown rot development, since all fruit were free from disease symptoms on removal from cold storage. However after 7 d at 20 °C, untreated fruit were rotted over 45% depending on the Monilinia species but the antagonists completely inhibited M. laxa and M. fructicola, while M. fructigena infections were reduced by 89.8% and 91.2% by \{L1\} and L8, respectively.

abstract = "Abstract: Mamey apple is mainly eaten raw in fruit salads or made into jellies or ice cream. The fruit is highly perishable which limits its shelf life and transport. The use of low temperatures for its handling and storage is limited because the fruit is sensitive to chilling injury. Therefore, other preservation techniques may represent better options. Very little research has been done on the postharvest physiology and handling of the fruit. Controlled and/or modified atmospheres may be required in order to extend its storage life. In fact, more research on mamey apple is needed in almost all aspects of postharvest physiology and technology. A recent scientific study has found mamey apple to have protective effects on gastric ulcers, using an animal model. Further research on its health benefits would also be beneficial. "

After cold storage for 10, 20, 30 and 40 days at 2 °C, the fruit was analysed for weight loss, flesh firmness, total soluble solids (TSS), titratable acidity (TA) and skin ground colour. Plums were ripened for 3 days at 20 °C after storage and were investigated at 10 examination stages during storage and after ripening. Significant differences were found in fruit mass, weight loss, skin colour, firmness, \{TSS\} and \{TA\} between harvest dates during storage and after ripening. An increase in fruit mass, \{TSS\} and skin colour was observed in plums during the harvesting period, whereas flesh firmness decreased significantly during the same period. Significant changes were also noted in fruit mass, skin colour, firmness and \{TSS\} during ripening. In general, at room temperature \{TSS\} increased, whereas firmness decreased. Less mature fruit withstood cold storage better than more mature fruit. However, less mature fruit had lesser quality when ripened than mature fruit. It is suggested that the best poststorage quality of ‘Green Gage’ plums would be obtained when fruit were harvested with a skin ground colour between −12 and −13 measured with a colorimeter as a* and a flesh firmness between 35 and 40 N. A lesser degree of harvest maturity was associated with inability of fruit to ripen because fruit picked too early stayed firmer over the whole storage period. "

Flowering faba bean plants were managed as mulch on the melon plant rows and cut and incorporated into the soil, in comparison with cultivated soil (control) and black plastic mulch. The plastic mulch increased the soil temperature by about 2 °C compared to cultivated soil. Interestingly, melon plants mulched with faba bean plants and plastic produced higher fruit weight and pulp percentage, but the soil management practices also affected fruit chemical composition. Plastic mulch and faba bean plants induced an increase of total soluble solids and a decrease of acidity. Plastic mulch alone induced the lowest glucose content (0.13 g 100 g−1); treatments with faba bean plants favored the highest fructose accumulation in melon fruits (0.23 g 100 g−1). No clear differences emerged among the treatments with regard to sucrose accumulation in ‘Baggio’, but the faba bean plants managed as mulch induced a high sucrose concentration in ‘Yago’ fruits. Treatments with faba bean plants induced the highest K+ accumulation (3324 and 3077 mg kg−1 f.w.); in fact, K+ scarcely accumulated in melon fruits harvested from plants mulched with plastic (2543 mg kg−1 f.w.). Faba bean mulching also drastically increased the PO43− accumulation. However, unclear responses were obtained for SO42− increment for ‘Baggio’, while ‘Yago’ showed drastic SO42− accumulation by mulching with faba bean plants. The soil treatments did not affect the accumulation of Mg2+. "

Significant changes to day-of-year-of-maturity (DOYM), both earlier and later than average, causes logistical problems during harvest, impacting on grape and wine quality. Shifts in climate circulation patterns resulting from atmospheric teleconnections to changes in sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies associated with El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) events can alter seasonal weather across Australia. Events tend to peak in the austral spring (IOD) and summer (ENSO), when vine and berry development is susceptible to anomalous weather. To investigate the impacts of \{ENSO\} and \{IOD\} on the Australian winegrape growing sector, \{SST\} data and annual grape maturity data from a variety of wine growing regions were collected and analysed. Mean \{DOYM\} values during \{IOD\} events were significantly (P &lt; 0.05) different for the largest number of vineyard blocks, with \{IOD\} positive (IOD+) events linked to earliest mean \{DOYM\} and \{IOD\} negative (IOD−) events linked to latest mean DOYM. \{ENSO\} and \{IOD\} combined events (ENSOIOD) had the largest difference between earliest mean \{DOYM\} and latest mean \{DOYM\} (42 days). Results for \{ENSO\} only grouped events were mixed, with no clear pattern emerging. This finding suggests that the \{IOD\} had more impact on \{DOYM\} than \{ENSO\} and that the \{IOD\} superseded the \{ENSO\} signal in combined events for the regions included in this study. The results indicate that improved seasonal forecasting of IOD, ENSO, and combined events would allow the Australian winegrape sector to better plan for changes to timing of grape maturity and associated impacts on grape and wine quality, vineyard management, and harvest logistics.

In this study, 75 yeast cultures were isolated from healthy pears from two Patagonian cold-storage packinghouses. Aureobasidium pullulans, Cryptococcus albidus, Cryptococcus difluens, Pichia membranifaciens, Pichia philogaea, Rhodotorula mucilaginosa and Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast species were identified. Additionally, 13 indigenous isolates of Penicillium expansum and 10 isolates of Botrytis cinerea were obtained from diseased pears, characterized by aggressiveness and tested for sensitivity to postharvest fungicides. The yeasts were pre-selected for their ability to grow at low temperature. In a first biocontrol assay using the most aggressive and the most sensitive isolate of each pathogen, two epiphytic isolates of A. pullulans and R. mucilaginosa were the most promising isolates to be used as biocontrol agents. They reduced the decay incidence by P. expansum to 33% and the lesion diameter in 88% after 60 days of incubation in cold. Foreign commercial yeast used as a reference in assays, only reduced 30% of lesion diameter in the same conditions. Yeasts were not able to reduce the incidence of B. cinerea decay. The control activity of the best two yeasts was compared with the control caused by the fungicides in a second bioassay, obtaining higher levels of protection against P. expansum by the yeasts. These two regional yeasts isolates could be promising tools for the future development of commercial products for biological control. "

However, \{HW\} was more effective than \{HA\} in alleviating internal browning (IB) symptoms in fruit. \{HW\} treatment may be easier to affect the antioxidant system in peach fruit due to the higher heat transmission in water. \{HA\} treatment had no effect on either AsA metabolism or \{GSH\} metabolism. However, \{HW\} enhanced the AsA metabolism in the early stage of storage and the \{GSH\} metabolism in the late stage of storage. Enhanced AsA-GSH metabolism and up-regulated expressions of PpaSOD5, PpaCAT1 and PpaAPX2 in the \{HW\} treated fruit might play an important role in maintaining the lower \{ROS\} level and \{IB\} index during refrigerated storage.

The seed is apomictic, and more than one plant can arise from it. The peel, of an orange-brown colour at maturity, is thick but somewhat brittle. The fruit is nonclimacteric and fairly resistant to transport and storage. Adequate storage temperature is 12 °C while 6 °C results in chilling injury. Few studies have been done on its postharvest physiology and handling requirements. The success of small export quantities has raised interest in expanding production, since most of the fruit comes from wild or backyard trees, with little coming from technically conducted orchards.

Results indicated that disease incidence and lesion diameter were lower in oligochitosan-treated fruit compared with the respective control. The inhibitory effects of volatiles in navel orange rind on the spore germination of C. gloeosporioides were significantly enhanced in the treated fruit compared with the control. Biochemical evaluations revealed that the contents of hydroxyproline-rich glycoprotein were increased. Protopectin degradation was delayed during storage. In addition, the activities of defense-related enzymes, including pectin methylesterase, peroxidase, chitinase, and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, were increased in oligochitosan-treated navel orange fruit rinds. Our results suggested that pre-harvest oligochitosan spray can be a potential alternative to conventional control methods to prevent post-harvest anthracnose in navel orange. "

The results showed that \{MT\} treatment effectively slowed process of senescence in both peach cultivars, as indicated by reduced weight loss, decay incidence and respiration rate as well as maintained firmness, total soluble solids and ascorbic acid contents. \{MT\} treatment significantly enhanced the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, peroxidase and ascorbate peroxidase in both cultivars, but decreased the activity of lipoxygenase, levels of superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide, and malondialdehyde content. These results indicate that the activation of antioxidant enzymes to scavenge superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide by \{MT\} treatment was associated with the maintenance of membrane integrity, which might be a part of the mechanism implicated in delay of senescence in peach fruit.

High spatial resolution multispectral and thermal airborne imagery were used to monitor crown temperature and the Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI) over three commercial orchards comprising peach, nectarine and orange fruit trees during 2008. Irrigation regimes included sustained and regulated deficit irrigation strategies, leading to high variability of fruit quality at harvest. Stem water potential was used to monitor individual tree water status on each study site. Leaf samples were collected for destructive sampling of xanthophyll pigments to assess the relationship between the xanthophyll epoxidation state (EPS) and \{PRI\} at leaf and airborne-canopy level. At harvest, fruit size, Total Soluble Solids (TSS) and Tritatable Acidity (TA) were measured to characterize fruit quality. A statistically significant relationship between \{EPS\} and \{PRI\} was found at the leaf (r2 = 0.81) and canopy level (r2 = 0.41). Airborne-derived crown \{PRI\} calculated from the imagery acquired during the fruit growth was related to the ratio of the total soluble solids normalized by the tritatable acidity (TSS/TA), an indicator of fruit quality measured on the same trees, yielding a coefficient of determination of r2 = 0.50. The relationship between the integral of \{PRI\} time-series and TSS/TA yielded a coefficient of determination of r2 = 0.72 (peach) and r2 = 0.61 (nectarines). On the contrary, the relation between TSS/TA and the time-series of crown thermal imagery was very weak (r2 = 0.21 and 0.25 respectively). These results suggest that a physiological remote sensing indicator related to photosynthesis, such as PRI, is more appropriate for fruit quality assessment than crown temperature, the established method of water stress detection, which is more related to crown transpiration. A radiative transfer modelling study was conducted to assess the potential validity of this methodology for fruit quality assessment when using medium spatial resolution imagery. The analysis shows important effects of soil and shadows on the \{PRI\} vs \{EPS\} relationship used for fruit quality assessment if non-pure crown reflectance was extracted from the imagery. "

Synthesis of hexyl acetate was suppressed under \{ULO\} storage regardless of temperature, while ethyl acetate synthesis was suppressed only by \{ULO\} at −1 °C. The levels of most aroma volatiles were recovered after the following 10 d of shelf-life, although with significantly lower recovery for methyl and ethyl (2E,4Z)-deca-2,4-dienoate in fruit under \{ULO\} storage. Although synthesis of aroma volatiles was most suppressed under \{ULO\} at −1 °C, butyl and hexyl acetate levels recovered better in fruit under \{ULO\} storage at −1 °C than at +1 °C. Acetaldehyde and nonanal were the principal aldehydes present, with levels that were higher in early harvested fruit and in fruit stored at +1 °C. Using multivariate analysis, we found two clusters one for after storage and the other for after shelf life samples, with the exception of pears after storage and after shelf life at +1 °C and normal atmosphere positioned on the lower side of graph Overall, this analysis discriminated between mentioned storage conditions that are specifically defined by hexylacetate and decanal on the one side and ethyl butanoate, pentyl acetate and α-farnesene on the other side.

The main objective of this work was to assess the effectiveness of individual film packaging, applied as a stand alone treatment or in combination with fludioxonil, on reducing the occurrence of husk scald, weight loss and decay. Fruit were dipped in an aqueous mixture containing 600 mg L−1 fludioxonil, wrapped or not wrapped with a polyolephinic heat-shrinkable film and stored at 8 °C and 90% \{RH\} for 6 or 12 weeks plus one additional week of simulated shelf-life at 20 °C and 65–70% RH. Respiration rate decreased both in cold storage and at 20 °C. Ethylene production was not detected during cold storage; its rate increased upon transfer to 20 °C, but results were inconsistent. Control fruit deteriorated at a very high rate, due to excessive weight loss, skin browning and decay. Film wrapping almost completely inhibited weight loss and husk scald and preserved fruit freshness for the whole storage time. There was no statistical difference in decay incidence between wrapped and control fruit after 6 or 12 weeks of storage and after the first shelf-life, while after the second shelf-life, wrapped fruit had significantly higher decay levels. By contrast, fludioxonil, both alone and in combination with wrapping, effectively controlled mold development, resulting in 50–67% less decay than control fruit after 12 weeks at 8 °C plus one week shelf-life. Control fruit showed minor changes in nutritional compounds as well as in total polyphenols, anthocyanins and antioxidant activity, while higher losses were detected in film-wrapped fruit during storage at 20 °C.

abstract = "Abstract The impact of different post-veraison deficit irrigation regimes on yield, berry coloration and bioactive compounds in a commercial vineyard of ‘Crimson Seedless’ cv. was evaluated during three consecutive years (2011–2013). Four irrigation treatments were assayed: (i) a Control, irrigated at 110% of seasonal crop evapotranspiration (ETc), (ii) regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) irrigated similar to Control levels during pre-veraison and at 50% of the same during post-veraison (a non-critical period); (iii) partial root drying-zone (PRD), irrigated in a similar way to \{RDI\} but alternating (every 10–14 days) the dry and wet sides of the root-zone, and (iv) a null irrigation treatment (NI) which only received natural precipitation and occasional supplementary irrigation when the midday stem water potential (Ψs) exceeded −1.2 MPa. Total yield and fruit quality at harvest were not significantly affected by \{RDI\} or PRD. Only \{NI\} led to a reduction in yield and the weight of clusters and berries to compare with the other irrigated counterparts. All deficit irrigation treatments enhanced berry coloration and provided a higher crop yield in the first pick harvest compared with the Control treatment. Although \{RDI\} and \{PRD\} received similar annual volumes of water, \{PRD\} induced a greater accumulation of skin anthocyanins and resveratrol, while increasing the soluble phenolic content and antioxidant capacity evaluated at harvest. However, the higher values of anthocyanins observed in \{PRD\} could not be explained by higher values of xylem abscisic acid (ABAxylem) because is the phloem which feeds berries during veraison.. Overall, our results demonstrate a strong relationship between the total amount of water supplied during the growing season and the main parameters related to yield, water use efficiency and bioactive compounds that are beneficial to health.

Variability of maturity and quality at harvest and following storage and ripening period is thought to be strongly influenced by canopy light conditions during fruit development, in conjunction with once-off harvesting practices. During 2000/01 and 2001/02, the plum cultivars Prunus salicina Lindell ‘Laetitia’ and ‘Songold’ were subjected to different levels of shading by bagging entire scaffold branches with shade netting. Resulting light treatments gave 100 (control, no bags), 70, 45 and 25% photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD). Fruit quality was assessed at harvest (once-off) following simulated commercial dual temperature storage (10 days at −0.5 °C followed by 8 days at 7.5 °C) and following 5–7 days of ripening at 15 °C. Shaded (≤70% PPFD) ‘Laetitia’ plums were less mature at harvest than exposed fruit and were smaller and firmer with a greener ground colour, lower soluble solids concentration (SSC) and poorer red colour. During postharvest cold storage, ripening processes proceeded more rapidly in shaded fruit relative to non-shaded fruit. This resulted in shelf quality not much inferior to fruit grown under high light conditions, since differences in firmness and \{SSC\} were reduced. However, under preharvest light levels less than 70% skin ground and red colour of ripe fruit remained poorer. Shaded ‘Songold’ plums were slightly greener and had lower \{SSC\} at harvest, but treatment differences became non-significant after storage and ripening. Postharvest internal disorders were virtually absent in both cultivars during both seasons. Based on our findings, we propose that plum tree canopies should be managed in such a way as to ensure light exposure of at least 70% in all bearing positions, which should result in more uniform maturity and postharvest quality of plums. Strip-picking is discouraged, since this will result in mixed quality on the shelf, particularly with regard to colour. "

There is a discrepancy in the literature since some authors reported that changes in fruit gas compositions differ in attached and detached fruits. This study presents for the first time an overview of pre- and post-harvest factors that lead to variations in the climacteric respiration and ethylene production, and attempts to determine their impacts on fruit composition, i.e., dry matter, total soluble solids content and acidity. The impact of growing conditions such as the fruit position in the canopy and the fruit carbon supply; fruit detachment from the tree, including the maturity stage at harvest; and storage conditions after harvest, i.e., relative humidity and temperature were considered as well as changes in fruit skin resistance to gas diffusion during fruit growth and storage. Results showed that fruit gas composition vary with all pre and post-harvest factors studied. Although all mangoes underwent a respiratory climacteric and an autocatalytic ethylene production, whatever pre and post-harvest factors studied, large differences in ethylene production, climacteric respiration and fruit quality were measured. Results suggested that the ripening capacity is not related to the fruit ability to produce great amount of ethylene. In agreement with precedent studies, this work provided several lines of evidence that gas composition of fruit is related to its water balance. Our measurements indicated that skin resistance to gas diffusion increased after the harvest and during storage. It was so suggested that the faster ripening of detached fruit may be explained in part by changes in fruit water balance and skin resistance to gas diffusion caused by fruit detachment. "

However, 1-MCP efficacy was reduced moderately in \{E1H2\} fruit and reduced to a greater extend in \{E2H2\} fruit. Internal ethylene concentration (IEC) at harvest was not detected in \{H1\} fruit from either elevation, but it accumulated in \{E1H2\} and \{E2H2\} fruit (E2H2 &gt; E1H2). The holding temperature at 5 °C but not 0 °C for 12 d between harvest and 1-MCP treatment increased fruit \{IEC\} and ethylene production rate and reduced the fruit response to subsequent 1-MCP treatment. The fruit physiological stage at the moment of 1-MCP treatment determined the efficacy of 1-MCP in extending the storage life of ‘Bartlett’ pears. 1-MCP retarded development of ripening capacity and 10–14 d at 20 °C were needed to ripen 1-MCP treated ‘Bartlett’ pears to optimum eating quality following 5–6 months of cold storage.

However, these techniques could strongly affect the aromatic flavor of tomato. In this study, RNA-sequencing was employed to characterize the transcriptomic profiles of cherry tomato fruit, harvested at breaker stage, during postharvest storage under different temperatures (25 °C, 10 °C, and 4 °C) and at 10 °C after 1-MCP treatment. Results showed that storage temperature remarkably affected the expression of numerous genes in tomato fruit, especially on several key genes associated with aroma volatile biosynthesis. It was found that 33 genes presented significantly different expression between 10 °C and 25 °C, and in particular, five genes expressed significantly lower at 10 °C than that at 25 °C, including CCD1, GOT1, ADH2, PDC1-like1, and PDC1-like2, mainly involved in the syntheses of pseudoionone, β-ionone, phenylacetaldehyde, phenylethylalcohol, cis-3-hexenol, and trans-3-Hexenol. The expression level of other 14 genes associated with aroma volatile biosynthesis was lower at 4 °C than that at 10 °C, among which, five genes, including TPS24, PDS, ACOT9-like, \{ADH2\} and \{AAT\} were directly related to the biosynthesis of terpenoids, alcohols and esters. Only few genes associated with aroma volatiles were affected by 1-MCP treatment at 10 °C. The presented results implied that the recommended storage temperature of 10 °C is able to result in a significant negative effect on the aromatic flavor of tomato at the gene transcriptional level, which could explain the flavor loss of tomato under market storage temperatures (8–12 °C) and household refrigerator temperatures (3–5 °C). To be mentioned, our results provide strong evidence that 10 °C, as the recommended storage temperature for tomato fruit, is not ideal to maintain the flavor quality of tomato, and 1-MCP treatment under 10 °C cannot further affect the flavor quality of tomato fruit compared with that at 10 °C alone.

We attempted to identify differences affected by growth stage, storage conditions, and harvest timing. Fruit softening was a process caused by changes in cell size, \{IS\} widening, and the breaking of cell wall concatenation. Fruits in the growth stage were softened primarily by cell expansion and subsequent widening of the IS. For fruits stored at room temperature, softening proceeded very rapidly; the reason underlying rapid softening appeared to be the empty spaces created by cell wall destruction. For fruits stored at low temperature, rapid softening caused by the destruction of cell walls was delayed, but the fruits softened continually due to \{IS\} widening. Furthermore, cell size exhibited a positive correlation with firmness, which caused \{IS\} widening and softening of the fruits due to cell contraction. Thus, decreased cell size and widened \{IS\} caused softening under low-temperature conditions, and the relationship between softening and cell size was different than that observed during the growth stage.

Its fruits are highly suitable for biodiesel production owing to the high quantity and quality of its oil. However, commercial exploitation of this species remains insufficient. Forms of harvesting, the storage period, and the use of chemicals for the postharvest preservation of macauba fruits and their effects on the associated microbiota were investigated. Mature fruits were collected only once from the mother tree and separated in two groups, a group of fruits not exposed to the ground surface (0 days) and a larger group of fruits that was placed in contact with the soil surface for 7, 14, and 21 days, to allow infestation of soil-borne microorganisms. Then the fruits were treated with 3 doses of fungicide fungicide (0, 0.2, and 0.4% v/v) and storage at room temperature during 0, 10, 20, 30 and 40 days. Hence the experiment was set in a randomized block design with four replications in a factorial Scheme 4 × 3 × 5 (period of ground surface contact, doses of fungicide and period of storage). The mesocarp oil content (OC), free fatty acids, and oxidative stability of the oil were evaluated, and the presence of microorganisms in the mesocarp and epicarp of the macauba fruits was quantified. Fungicide was found to be effective in maintaining low oil acidity of fruits unexposed to the soil surface for up to 20 days of storage and for maintaining oil oxidative stability. Regardless of the fungicide dose applied, an increase in the \{OC\} was noted for all harvest times during the first 10 days of storage. Therefore, for biodiesel production, it is recommended that the fruits should be harvested when in pre-absciscion stage (directly from the mother tree) or collected from the ground after no more than 7 days after abscission. In both cases, the fruits must be pre-treated with fungicide if storage is intended. "

Plums within this \{RSSC\} range combined with low \{RTA\} (≤0.60%) were disliked by 18% of consumers, while plums with \{RTA\} ≥1.00% were disliked by 60% of consumers. Plums with \{RSSC\} ≥12.0% had ∼ 75% consumer acceptance, regardless of RTA. Fruit harvested between 35.6 and 17.8 N had high consumer acceptance because of lower \{RTA\} and higher \{RSSC\} than earlier harvested fruit. Ripening plums before consumption decreased \{TA\} by approximately 30% from the \{TA\} measured at harvest. In some cases, this decrease in \{TA\} during ripening may increase the acceptability of plums that would otherwise be unacceptable. Development of chilling injury (CI) symptoms limited market life of fruit harvested early (44.5–35.6 N) and late (17.8–13.3 N). Late harvested fruit were more likely to develop flesh translucency (overripe or bladderiness) when stored at 5 °C, whereas early harvested fruit had low consumer acceptance and were more prone to develop flesh bleeding/browning during storage at 0 or 5 °C. Based on this work, ‘Blackamber’ plums are well adapted to late harvest but proper postharvest temperature management, including ripening, and marketing within its market life potential are necessary to avoid the onset of storage disorders and maintain flavor.

Sugar content varies throughout fruit development according to three processes (the supply of carbohydrates to the fruit, fruit metabolism, and dilution) which are affected by environmental factors, mainly temperature, rainfall and fertilization. The ecophysiological model of soluble sugar accumulation was linked to SIMPIÑA, a crop model that accurately predicts the daily increases in flesh dry and fresh weight. When the process-based model and crop model were linked, the dry and fresh matter of the pineapple flesh, as affected by climatic conditions, could be used as inputs to predict the \{TSS\} (%) at harvest. The relative rate of transformation of carbon as sugars in the fruit flesh for the synthesis of compounds other than sugars was estimated during fruit growth. \{TSS\} (%) were compared for harvested fruit grown under eight agro-climatic conditions. In the flesh of fruit harvested close to maturity, i.e., at 1400 degree-days after flowering, \{TSS\} (%) were significantly related (r2 = 0.55, P &lt; 0.001) to total soluble sugar content. The variability of \{TSS\} (%) between the eight agro-climatic groups ranged from 16.9 for pineapples grown in dry locations irrigated, under N-deficit conditions to 19.4 for pineapples grown in dry locations, without irrigation and without N deficiency. The variability of \{TSS\} (%) was substantial within each of the eight agro-climatic groups: standard deviations ranged from 0.9 to 1.5 for pineapples grown in dry locations, irrigated, without N deficiency and in dry locations, without irrigation and without N deficiency, respectively. For data from 14 experiments conducted under different climatic conditions, N fertilization, and irrigation conditions, the model predicted the \{TSS\} (%) at harvest with an \{RRMSE\} of 0.04. By linking this sugar model to the SIMPIÑA crop model, the impact of environmental conditions and cultural practices on the growth and development of pineapple are taken into account to predict the gustatory quality of pineapple grown on Reunion Island. The model could have a practical application to manage fruit quality, plan harvest, and marketing. "

We also examined whether inter-annual variations in climatic conditions drive differences on thermal requirements; and how the predicted climate change scenarios would influence the thermal time for germination. Seeds of Vriesea friburgensis, V. bituminosa, V. pardalina, Tillandsia gardneri, and Racinaea aerisincola were collected in 2000 and 2013 and sown to germinate in a temperature gradient (15–35 °C) under light and dark conditions. A thermal-time approach was then applied to the germination results, and the thermal-times needed to reach 50% germination (θ50) were modeled according to the climatic conditions of both years, as well as two simulated scenarios climate change. The bromeliads exhibited differences in their thermal requirements for germination. Tb‘s of from 6.2 to 10 °C and Tc‘s of from 31.6 to 41.7 °C were identified, depending on the species. The extent and severity of the dry season during fruiting appeared to have determined differences in θ50 values. All species, except V. pardalina, which have fruiting during the rainy season, presented higher θ50 values in the year with a more intense drought (2013). Under the warming scenarios, a reduction in the time required to sum heat units to germinate was found, but a risk for persistence was identified for R. aerisincola in the campos rupestres due to its narrow seed germination window. The determination of thermal thresholds for germination can be useful to identify species vulnerability to climate change and to promote strategies for conservation of bromeliads species. "

We have obtained ku70 mutants of Penicillium digitatum, the main citrus postharvest pathogen. The increased efficiency of \{HR\} in Δku70 strains was demonstrated by the generation of mutants in two different chitin synthase genes (PdchsII and PdchsV). P. digitatum Δku70 strains showed no differences from the parental strain in vegetative growth, asexual development or virulence to citrus fruit, when experiments were conducted at the optimal temperature of 24 °C. However, growth of Δku70 strains at temperatures higher than 24 °C demonstrated a detrimental effect in axenic growth and conidia production. These observations are in agreement with previous studies describing differences between ku70 mutants and their parental strains in some fungal species, and must be taken into account for future applications of the Δku approach to increase \{HR\} efficiency in fungi.

The present study was undertaken to further examine the influence of this allelotype (-1/1, -1/2 or -2/2) and its interaction with harvest season (early or late) on changes in internal ethylene concentrations (IEC) and fruit softening during cold air storage. This was carried out by describing natural differences found among old apple cultivars/species and modern commercial cultivars. For late maturing cultivars, Md-ACS1-1/1 was firmer at harvest than Md-ACS1-2/2 with the heterozygote intermediate. However harvest firmness showed no differences among for the early season Md-ACS1 allelotypes. The Md-ACS1-2/2 allelotype had a slower rate of postharvest \{IEC\} increase and flesh softening compared with Md-ACS1-1/1 and -1/2 allelotypes, and late maturing cultivars had a slower rate of fruit softening than early maturing cultivars, which was independent of postharvest IEC. All three late season allelotypes and early season Md-ACS1-2/2 were firmer after storage than early season Md-ACS1-1/1 and -1/2 allelotypes, reflecting differences in both harvest firmness and softening rates. While cultivar variation in final firmness could be explained partially through Md-ACS1-mediated postharvest ethylene increases and subsequent softening, much more variation was accounted for by their differences in harvest firmness. These results are discussed in relation to strategies for breeding cultivars with superior flesh textures that are maintained during storage. "

Most wine-producing regions in China feature a continental monsoon climate with hot-wet summers and dry-cold winters, giving grapes markedly different growing environments compared to the Mediterranean or oceanic climates described in previous reports. This study focused on comparing the volatile profiles of Vitis vinifera L. cv. Cabernet Sauvignon berries from two regions with distinct climate characteristics: Changli has a warm and semi-humid summer, and Gaotai has a cool-arid summer and a cold winter. The relationship between meteorological metrics and the concentrations of grape volatiles were also examined. In harvested grapes, benzyl alcohol, phenylethyl alcohol, 1-hexanol and 1-octen-3-ol were more abundant in the Changli berries, while hexanal, heptanal, 2-methoxy-3-isobutylpyrazine, and (E)-β-damascenone presented higher levels in the Gaotai berries. The fluctuation in the accumulation of volatile compounds observed during berry development was closely correlated with variations in short-term weather (weather in a week), especially rainfall. The concentration of some volatiles, notably aliphatic aldehydes, was significantly related to diurnal temperature differences. The variability during berry development of concentrations for compounds such as \{C6\} volatile compounds, 2-methoxy-3-isobutylpyrazine and (E)-β-damascenone strongly depended upon weather conditions. This work expands our knowledge about the influence of continental monsoon climates on volatile compounds in developing grape berries. It will also improve the comprehension of the plant response to their surrounding environments through the accumulation of volatiles. The results will help growers to alter viticultural practices according to local conditions to improve the aromatic quality of grapes. "

Bagging treatments began at 34 days after anthesis and continued until harvest. The results showed that bagging modified the microenvironment for fruit development. Bagging with \{TPB\} was most effective in increasing humidity, and air moisture within \{TPB\} maintained above 90% from 2 weeks after bagging. Bagging with \{BAFB\} or \{WAFB\} increased humidity most of the time, and the effect was more prominent when the weather was very dry (RH &lt; 60%). All bag types tended to increase temperature and promoted fruit development, resulting in larger sized fruit. Bagging tended to promote early fruit drop but reduced late fruit drop, and the final fruit retention rate was not significantly affected by bagging. Bagging with different materials showed differential effects on incidence of fruit cracking. \{WAFB\} and \{BAFB\} reduced cracking incidence significantly as compared to the control (5.1% and 11.6% vs 32.8%). Sugar content was not significantly affected by bagging but organic acids including vitamin C (Vc) were considerably affected.

The responses of oxalate and Vc contents in the aril and the pericarp to bagging treatments showed an opposite trend. The results suggested that \{WAFB\} increased fruit size and fruit retention rate while significantly reduced fruit cracking incidence and could be a promising practice for cross-winter longan production.

After harvest, persimmon (Diospyros kaki, ‘Mopan’) fruits were treated with 95% \{CO2\} at room temperature, and the results showed that fruit firmness rapidly decreased and the respiratory and ethylene release rates increased. At the same time, hydroxyl radicals (OH) and O2− rapidly accumulated, and the activities of related antioxidant enzymes such as dismutase peroxidase, catalase and peroxidase superoxide, also changed. The effects of \{OH\} induced by the Fenton reaction on the cell wall materials in vitro were investigated; the water soluble pectin and CDTA-soluble pectin contents increased, and Na2CO3-soluble pectin content decreased. Due to the increasing levels of reactive oxygen species, especially OH, during persimmon fruit softening, and the in vitro effect of \{OH\} on the scission of cell wall polysaccharides, we postulated that \{OH\} may be involved in persimmon fruit softening.

Hunter a* values of black tomatoes increased with storage temperature and duration; storage of immature fruits at high temperature favored lycopene accumulation. Chlorophyll levels of black tomatoes declined during storage, but differences between mature and immature tomatoes stored at 12 °C were minimal. β-Carotene levels of black tomatoes increased during early storage, but rapidly declined beginning 13 d post-harvest. The highest lycopene and chlorophyll levels were observed in mature black tomatoes stored at 12 °C for 13 d; these conditions also yielded the best quality fruit. Thus, the unique pigmentation properties of black tomatoes can be precisely controlled by standardizing storage conditions. "

These wound pathogens can infect through injuries caused during harvest and postharvest handling, which lead to large economic losses. Susceptibility of fruit to mechanical damage or infection increases during ripening. However, few studies have been focussed on the fruit wound-induced defence responses, such as \{H2O2\} production. In this study, the characterisation of \{H2O2\} production in orange (C. sinensis cv Valencia) and apple (M. domestica L. cv Golden Smoothee) fruit in response to abiotic (wounding) and biotic (pathogen and non-host pathogen) stresses at different maturity stages was investigated. The effect of \{H2O2\} on the ecophysiology of P. digitatum and P. expansum at different temperatures was also studied. The potential antifungal effect of \{H2O2\} in both pathogens depends on the temperature. P. expansum was more susceptible to higher levels of \{H2O2\} than P. digitatum, especially at 25 °C. The lesion diameter in compatible interactions increased significantly with fruit maturity in apples and oranges. Fruit maturity also increased susceptibility to non-host pathogen interactions, especially reducing apple resistance to P. digitatum in the over-mature stage. \{H2O2\} production showed different patterns depending on the fruit. In apples, the higher resistance of immature harvested fruit to pathogen infection correlated with an increase in \{H2O2\} production (biphasic oxidative burst), whereas in oranges, immature and commercial harvests exhibited a similar pattern of \{H2O2\} production among treatments. Production of \{H2O2\} in oranges and apples following abiotic (wounding) and biotic (pathogen and non-host pathogen) stresses depended on the harvest date. "

The objective of this study was to assess metabolite profiles changes, as a consequence of these abiotic stresses, using VIS/NIR reflectance in Granny Smith apples. Individual fruit was tagged and weekly monitored from 60 until 151 DAFB. Vis/NIR reflectance measurements (350–1100 nm) were taken on the fruit surface on apples unexposed to direct sunlight (NE, class 0), exposed to direct sunlight (EX, class 1) and those that developed sunburn in the categories of Mild (class 2), Moderate (class 3), and Severe (class 4). Spectral curves were analyzed using discriminant partial least square models (PLS-DA) and interval \{PLS\} discriminant analysis (iPLS-DA). PLS-DA analysis was able to separate fruit with and without visible sun injury with a classification error of 22.5% and 35.7% for class 3 and 2, respectively. Class 3 and 4 observed at 129 \{DAFB\} was predicted through reflectance spectra captured 87 \{DAFB\} by PLS-DA, with 550–570 nm, 715–750 nm, and 810–850 nm spectral intervals responsible ranges for discrimination. Such changes in Vis/NIR reflectance among classes would be related to changes in pigments (carotenoids and flavonoids) and apple tissue structural properties. These findings indicate that the method offers potential for nondestructive prediction of sunburn occurrence on apples in the orchard, that could lead to development of an automated system to forecast sunburn occurrence.

After propagation the plants were transferred to a greenhouse and grown at a constant \{DT\} and \{NT\} set point of 21°C for 8 weeks after propagation. The experiment was carried out in early spring under natural light conditions. The rate of development was dependent on the temperature regime. \{DT\} lower than \{NT\} inhibited growth and development of the young plants, except for leaf unfolding rate which depended on the average daily temperature (ADT) only. Both an increase in \{ADT\} and \{DIF\} enhanced internode length. However, increasing the \{ADT\} by only raising \{DT\} affected the elongation to a larger extent than an equal raise of \{DT\} and NT. For flower bud development an increase in negative values of \{DIF\} reduced the number of flower buds to a greater extent than an increase in positive values. The optimum propagation temperature, based on earliness (first harvest) and early yield was approximately 25°C. Raising the \{ADT\} from 15 to 25°C reduced the time to first harvest by 1.6 days per 1°C and increased the average total yield during the first 8 weeks after transplanting by 0.54 kg m−2 °C−1. \{DIF\} had no effect on earliness nor the yield, but improved fruit quality.

abstract = "The maturity of nectarines at harvest can be assessed by measuring the absorption coefficient at 670 nm (μa) with the non-destructive technique of time-resolved reflectance spectroscopy (TRS). A kinetic model links μa, converted into the biological shift factor (BSF), to firmness decrease during ripening; in this way the firmness decay model includes the variations in maturity at harvest, thereby allowing prediction of shelf-life for individual fruit. In order to study how this methodology could be practically used at the time of harvest, when μa can be measured non-destructively on all fruit, while the destructive measurement of firmness can only be done on a small sample, various firmness decay models were developed using either data at harvest or within 1–2 d after harvest from previous experimental research with nectarines carried out over a 5-year period. These models were then tested for prediction and classification ability by comparing the predicted firmness and class of usability to the actual ones measured during ripening and their performance compared to that of models based on data during the whole shelf-life. Our results suggest that the methodology might be used as a management tool in the nectarine supply chain. Independently from the actual softening rate, the classification at harvest based on μa is able to segregate fruit of different quality and maturity according to their softening behaviour during shelf-life. Among the various models, those estimated using data at harvest and after 24 h of shelf-life had better performance than those based only on data at harvest. In the 2002 and 2005 seasons, this model showed a classification ability very close to that of models based on data during the whole shelf-life. However, its performance in the 2004 season was not so good, because it could not take into account the influence of cold storage periods prior to shelf-life. All the steps necessary to apply this methodology are detailed. "

The disorder is characterized by sunken areas or ‘pits’ on the flavedo followed by browning and dryness of affected areas in severe stages. Despite its uncertain cause, coating fruit with commercial waxes coupled with warm-temperature storage has been reported to promote peel pitting. In this work, we examined the effect of changes in relative humidity (RH) and waxing at various times during storage on the incidence of postharvest peel pitting. Grapefruit stored at 20 °C and constant low (30%) or high (90%) \{RH\} developed low levels of peel pitting, even if waxed immediately after harvest. In contrast, when fruit stored at 30% \{RH\} were transferred to 90% RH, the incidence of peel pitting markedly increased, while transferring from 90 to 30% \{RH\} did not lead to increased pitting. This effect was greater in fruit exposed to prolonged periods of dehydration at 30% RH. Removal or redistribution of natural surface fruit waxes by washing followed by storage at low \{RH\} had little effect on peel pitting, but the transfer of washed fruits from low to high \{RH\} markedly increased peel damage. Waxing fruit enhanced severity of the damage only if there was a previous dehydration period. Light microscopy of damaged peel revealed no difference in morphology of affected tissues whether fruit were transferred from low to high RH, or after waxing following dehydration. Taken together, the results suggest that in ‘Marsh’ grapefruit the alteration of water relations in peel is a key factor in the incidence of postharvest peel pitting, and that preservation of a constant water status prior to and during postharvest handling may have an important role in maintaining peel quality.

Postharvest physiological quality traits including firmness, total soluble solids, total acidity, ascorbic acid and volatile production were characterized following storage under different conditions. The observed post-storage protein expression profiles may be associated with delayed senescence features in strawberry. A total of 454 proteins were identified in differentially treated strawberry fruits. Quantitative analysis, using normalized spectral counts, revealed 73 proteins common to all treatments, which formed three clusters in a hierarchical clustering analysis. The proteins spanned a range of functions in various metabolic pathways and networks involved in carbohydrate and energy metabolism, volatile biosynthesis, phenylpropanoid activity, stress response and protein synthesis, degradation and folding. After \{CA\} and \{LT\} storage, 16 (13) and 11 (17) proteins, respectively, were significantly increased (decreased) in abundance, while expression profile of 12 proteins was significantly changed by both \{CA\} and LT. To summarize, the differential variability of abundance in strawberry proteome, working in a cooperative manner, provided an overview of the biological processes that occurred during \{CA\} and \{LT\} storage. Biological significance Controlled atmosphere storage at an optimal temperature is regarded to be an effective postharvest technology to delay fruit senescence and maintain fruit quality during shelf life. Nonetheless, little information on fruit proteomic changes under controlled atmosphere and/or low temperature storage is available. The significance of this paper is that it is the first study employing a label-free approach in the investigation of strawberry fruit response to controlled atmosphere and cold storage. Changes in postharvest physiological quality traits including volatile production, firmness, ascorbic acid, soluble solids and total acidity were also characterized. Significant biological changes associated with senescence were revealed and differentially abundant proteins under various storage conditions were identified. Proteomic profiles were linked to physiological aspects of strawberry fruit senescence in order to provide new insights into possible regulation mechanisms. Findings from this study not only provide proteomic information on fruit regulation, but also pave the way for further quantitative studies at the transcriptomic and metabolomic levels. "

Bruising due to impact is one of the most important reasons for the quality loss in the fresh fruit market. Regarding to the accuracy and economic justification, Finite Element Method (FEM) is one of the best ways of investigating the effective factors in bruising produced as a result of impact. In this research, \{FEM\} is used to study the dynamic impact to apple. For soft and relatively large objects like apple, the dynamic waves are absorbed by the body of the object through decreasing the kinetic energy during the impact. The amount of energy absorption is dependent upon the viscoelastic properties, geometric size of the object during the collision, and collision velocity. Therefore, in such materials, contact area and the induced stress in contact region are time dependent. In finite element modeling, a nonlinear time-dependent contact is considered. Through the use of finite element models of a typical fruit, the apple, some collision processes of the fruit were studied. The 3D \{FEM\} models were created to illustrate, as closely as possible, the typical geometrical structure of an apple fruit, containing the basic inhomogeneous structure of the fruit. In the current study, using Finite element method, the behavior of the various layers of skin, cortex and core of apple was analyzed applying impact test to collision of the fruit with a flat rigid plate as well as the collision of an apple with another apple. The different layers of apple such as skin, cortex and core have not been yet analyzed dynamically so it plays a remarkably important role. The results showed that the parameters of displacement, velocity, acceleration, stress and hydrostatic pressure in the collision of apple to apple were less than that of apple to rigid object at the velocity of 1 m/s. Also, changes of these parameters were maximum in a skin and minimum in a core. "

Postharvest hypobaric treatment is a potential new technique to delay fruit ripening and quality deterioration in fruit. Honey peach fruit were stored under four different pressure conditions (101, 10–20, 40–50 and 70–80 kPa) for 30 days at 0 °C and at 85–90% RH. The fruit were then observed for 4 days at 25 °C and 80–85% RH. Decay index, content of total soluble solids (TSS), ascorbic acid, malondialdehyde (MDA), membrane permeability, \{H2O2\} content, superoxide anion (O2−) production rate, activities of lipoxygenase (LOX), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) and contents of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and adenosine monophosphate (AMP) were measured. Results indicated that hypobaric treatment at 10–20 kPa delayed decay rates and maintained overall quality, and extended the shelf-life of honey peach fruit. Furthermore, the application of 10–20 kPa treatment effectively delayed increases in both O2− production rate and \{H2O2\} content, enhanced activities of \{CAT\} and \{SOD\} and increased contents of \{ATP\} and \{ADP\} while reducing \{LOX\} activity and \{AMP\} content during low temperature storage and the following shelf-life at room temperature. These data indicated that the shelf-life extension of honey peach by hypobaric treatment could be due to increased energy status, enhanced antioxidant ability and less membrane damage. The relationships of \{ATP\} content with membrane damage, radical oxygen species (ROS) production and antioxidant enzyme activities is discussed. "

Under this scheme, the first compartment represented all tissue contributing to the setting of potential fruit size (determined as the integral of its output) whereas the second compartment represented all other fruit tissue whose growth actualized that potential. Expansion of both compartments was assumed to have a temperature response with an optimum, whereas an aging process with an asymptotic temperature response controlled transfer to the second compartment. Model parameters were estimated by fitting to data from controlled environment experiments in which early-season temperature conditions were varied. Predicted fruit growth curves showed close agreement with measured diameter data. The results were consistent with a two-fold impact of early-season temperatures on apple fruit size: an immediate, direct effect on growth rate and an enduring effect, mediated through fruit cell number or resource allocation to young fruit, reflecting the establishment of a potential that subsequent growth actualizes.

Two airborne campaigns were conducted with the Airborne Hyperspectral Scanner (AHS) over olive and peach orchards located in Córdoba, southern Spain. The \{AHS\} sensor was flown at three different times on 25 July 2004 and 16 July 2005, collecting 2 m spatial resolution imagery in 80 spectral bands in the 0.43–12.5 μm spectral range. Thermal bands were assessed for the retrieval of land surface temperature using the split-window algorithm and \{TES\} (Temperature-Emissivity-Separation) method, separating pure crowns from shadows and sunlit soil pixels using the reflectance bands. Stem water potential and stomatal conductance were measured on selected trees at the time of airborne flights over the orchards. Tree fruit yield and quality parameters such as oil, weight and water content (for the olive trees), and fruit volume and weight (for the peach trees) were obtained at harvest and through laboratory analysis. Relationships between airborne-estimated crown temperature minus air temperature and stem water potential yielded r2 = 0.5 (12:30 GMT) at the olive tree level, and r2 = 0.81 (9:00 GMT) at the treatment level in peach trees. These results demonstrate that water stress can be detected at the crown level even under the usual water management conditions of commercial orchards. Regressions of yield and fruit quality against remote sensing estimates of crown temperature as an indicator of water stress, yielded r2 = 0.95 (olive fruit water content) and r2 = 0.94 (peach fruit mean diameter). These results suggest that high-spatial remote sensing thermal imagery has potential as an indicator of some fruit quality parameters for crop field segmentation and irrigation management purposes. A simulation study using \{ASTER\} spectral bands and aggregated pixels for stress detection as a function of irrigation level was conducted in order to study the applicability of medium resolution thermal sensors for the global monitoring of open-canopy tree crops. The determination coefficients obtained between the ASTER-simulated canopy temperature minus air temperature and stem water potential yielded r2 = 0.58 (12:30 GMT) for olive trees, suggesting the potential for extrapolating these methods to \{ASTER\} satellite for global monitoring of open tree canopies.

The growth of the pathogens was not affected by lowering the temperature to 3 °C whereas the growth of M. albus was minimized below 5 °C. The fungal decay pathogens were still controlled well at 3 °C, but the bacteria were not. The effectiveness of M. albus to control in vivo apple decay caused by S. sclerotiorum, B. cinerea or P. expansum was variable and poor, probably due to the short biofumigation period (72 h) employed. The positive results obtained for S. sclerotiorum in all conditions and for B. cinerea in regular air in vivo at 3 °C on apple fruit, indicate that M. albus could be a very useful tool for post harvest treatment in cool storage.

abstract = "This review summarizes the latest developments in hot water immersion treatment (HWT) and hot water rinsing and brushing (HWRB) technologies. These treatments kill pathogens that cause surface decay, while maintaining fruit quality during prolonged storage and marketing. They also are relatively easy to use, have a short operating time, and are efficient in heat transfer. The cost of a typical hot water technology commercial system is significantly less than that of a commercial vapor heat treatment system. The physiological responses of cultivars of different fruit species to heat treatments vary according to season, growing location, soil type, production practices and fruit maturity. In general, the higher the temperature, the shorter the treatment in order to avoid heat damage. \{HWT\} is applied at temperatures between 43 and 53 °C for periods of several minutes up to 2 h for quarantine treatments, while \{HWRB\} is employed commercially for 10–25 s at temperatures between 48 and 63 °C. The time and temperature of exposure that benefits fresh harvested quality depends on cultivar, fruit maturity, fruit size and condition during the growing season. Both \{HWT\} and \{HWRB\} inhibit ripening, reducing decay incidence and in several commodities induce resistance against pathogens and against chilling injuries. "

By including individual fruit maturity as a biological shift factor (BSF) into a kinetic model for softening it is possible to select fruit with different shelf-life potential. The \{BSF\} approach combined with \{TRS\} measurement and kinetic modeling of firmness was applied to a late maturing nectarine cultivar (‘Morsiani 90’), ripened at 20 °C after harvest or after storage at 0 °C and 4 °C, the latter conditions inducing chilling injury. At harvest the absorption coefficient μa had low values and low variability, indicating advanced maturity, while firmness was similar to that of early cultivars. The softening model took into account these differences, showing parameters similar to those of the early cultivars with the exception of the softening rate which was 2–6 times lower, indicating a slower softening in ‘Morsiani 90’ fruit. Decay of μa at 20 °C was also slower. Softening continued during storage at 4 °C, but not at 0 °C. After storage at 0 °C softening was resumed similarly to non-stored fruit, but with much variability. Fruit stored at 4 °C, which showed chilling injury, had a softening rate at 20 °C significantly higher than that of 0 °C fruit. It is suggested that the same changes in cell wall metabolism which induce the appearance of chilling injury also affect firmness and increase softening rate. "

As a semi-selective medium, Malonate Broth Agar supplemented with tetracycline hydroxychloride and incubation at high temperature (max. of 40 °C) facilitated the selective recovery of P. agglomerans CPA-2 colonies. The \{RAPD\} technique was applied to a collection of 13 strains of P. agglomerans, including CPA-2. Among the 12 primers tested, OPL-11 amplified a fragment (about 720 bp) specific to strain CPA-2. On the basis of this fragment, two \{SCAR\} markers were amplified using a primer pair derived from OPL-11 elongation. A first \{SCAR\} marker of 720 bp was specifically amplified for the strain CPA-2 and a second one of 270 bp was obtained for all P. agglomerans strains tested, including CPA-2. Commercial trials demonstrated a significant reduction of decay with the treatment of formulated cells of P. agglomerans CPA-2. Population dynamics of CPA-2 in commercial trials were determined on fruit surfaces and in the environment using both the classical plating technique and \{PCR\} with \{SCAR\} primers. In general, no significant differences were observed between results obtained from the two methods. On fruit surfaces, 1 day after CPA-2 applied its population by classical methods was 4.37 × 106 cfu wound−1 and at the end of the experiment the population increased to 5.8 × 105 cfu wound−1. The percentages of colonies identified as P. agglomerans CPA-2 at these sampling times using \{SCAR\} primers were 90 and 95%, respectively. Population dynamics in the environment to evaluate the environmental fate of P. agglomerans CPA-2 showed that it has a limited persistence and limited capacity for dispersion. "

Two CPA-8-formulated products were obtained by fluid-bed spray-drying and then applied on fruit. Although both products included 20% sucrose plus 10% skimmed milk as protecting agents, they differ in the carrier material used during the formulation process: maltodextrin (CPA-8-formulated product called BA3) or potato starch (CPA-8-formulated product called BA4). CPA-8 has demonstrated wide tolerance to different factors such as, temperature, relative humidity and simulated rainfall. The minimal antagonist population obtained after exposure was generally higher than 104 \{CFU\} cm−2 of fruit surface, which ensures high treatment coverture and therefore, efficacy. The results also indicated that peaches were, in general, more suitable for the CPA-8 survival than nectarines. Moreover, the properties of the two CPA-8-formulated products influenced the population dynamics of the bacterium, suggesting that the \{BA4\} CPA-8-formulated product provided higher degree of ecological fitness of CPA-8 over the fruit than the \{BA3\} CPA-8-formulated product. The data obtained in this work led us to conclude that the integration of these CPA-8-formulated products into cropping systems is a promising strategy to achieve higher levels of brown rot control and hence contribute to a successful handling of postharvest diseases in stone fruit.

Skin colour and changes in chlorophyll and anthocyanin concentrations in relation to fruit firmness at three ripening temperatures (15, 20 and 25 °C) were studied. As fruit ripened, skin colour changed from green, to purple, to black, which was observed as a decrease in L, chroma and hue. Total anthocyanins in skin tissue increased during ripening, but this increase was due almost entirely to a single anthocyanin; cyanidin 3-O-glucoside. Cyanidin 3-O-glucoside concentration increased after 3–6 days postharvest (depending on ripening temperature), and levels increased earlier, and were higher, with higher ripening temperature. Chlorophyll a and b levels decreased until 4–5 days after harvest, but did not change significantly thereafter. No significant differences in chlorophyll concentration were observed among the three ripening temperatures. Fruit harvested directly from the tree (unripe) with skin darkening showed similar pigments changes to that during ripening (reduced chlorophyll and increased cyanidin 3-O-glucoside). Colour change in ‘Hass’ avocados from green to purple, then black, results from an initial decrease in chlorophyll content, followed by an increase in the levels of the anthocyanin, cyanidin 3-O-glucoside.

For most experimental purposes, \{LPE\} is dispersed in water prior to treatment of fruit using sonication. In this study, the water solubility of \{LPE\} was improved by mixing it with soy lecithin prior to mixing with water. A combination of \{LPE\} and lecithin was used for a dip treatment of banana fruit. Banana fruit at ripening stage 2 (3/4 green) were dipped in this solution for 30 min and then stored at room temperature for 10 d. A combination of 200 mg L−1 \{LPE\} and lecithin gave the best shelf life. In this treatment over 75% of the fruit were marketable 7 d after treatment. While only about 20% and 28% of the fruit were marketable in the water (control) and lecithin treated-fruit respectively. Fruit treated with lecithin alone had better shelf life as compared to the control. Furthermore, the \{LPE\} + lecithin treatment gave better shelf life as compared to the \{LPE\} alone treatment. At 7 d after dip, fruit treated with \{LPE\} + lecithin had lower ion leakage from peel tissue, higher pulp firmness, and thicker peel as compare to the control and lecithin treatments. A dip treatment with \{NAA\} (1-naphthalene acetic acid) was compared with \{LPE\} + lecithin for fruit marketability and changes in various fruit properties during ripening. Although \{NAA\} improved shelf life and retarded fruit softening as compared to the control, this treatment resulted in abnormal de-greening of fruit peel tissue. Fruit treated with \{LPE\} + lecithin had normal yellow color development and had lower ethylene production as compared to \{NAA\} and control treatments. The results of this study suggest that a dip treatment with a combination of \{LPE\} and lecithin may have potential for improving shelf life of banana fruit. "

After chilling, fruits were submitted to different distribution chains characterised by different handling conditions and storage temperatures (2 °C or 7 °C) and by a 12 h retailing step at 20 °C. Strawberry quality was assessed by measuring 7 parameters: weight loss, commercial loss, firmness, sugar content, acidity, colour and sensory quality. Compared to air-chilling, mist-chilling did not reduce chilling time but it reduced weight loss by 20–40%. Mist-chilling had no detrimental effect on commercial loss defined as the percentage of fruit more than 1/3 of surface affected. It did not induce any major changes on strawberry quality. Temperature fluctuations undergone during cold storage and retailing had a detrimental effect on weight loss. The beneficial effect of packaging on weight loss was confirmed. "

Lenticel breakdown is influenced by a combination of factors that include cultivation and handling practices, however the causes have not yet been determined. The motivation for the present research was to investigate the morphology and anatomy of lenticels, evaluating fruits at different stages of development. Fruits were evaluated from three different orchards in the Western Cape, South Africa, on an attempt to relate physical and morphological aspects of the fruit to the environment of the different regions. There is an indication that factors that influence fruit growth and cuticle development, e.g. relative humidity and temperature, are directly linked to lenticel breakdown. The lack of lenticel breakdown on the seasons studied limited our conclusions. "

All levels of ethylene increased the incidence of physiological disorders. However, the effect of ethylene was minor compared with the influence of temperature. Fruit stored at −1 °C remained firm and green, subsequently ripening normally at 20 °C, irrespective of exposure to ethylene. In contrast, all of the pears kept at 2 °C softened and yellowed during storage, and developed symptoms of superficial scald and internal browning.

Proteins from peach fruits after harvest (CK) and treated by heat combined with 1-MCP (HM) were then stored at room temperature for 0, 1, 3 and 5 days. Among the identified 42 protein spots, the differential abundant proteins belonged to pathways of defense and response (35.71%), energy and metabolism (30.95%), ripening and senescence (14.29%), cell structure (14.29%) and protein fate (4.76%). Compared with separate heat or 1-MCP treatment, pectinesterase inhibitor (PEI) and heat shock protein (HSP) appeared, and abscisic stress ripening-like protein (ASR) disappeared after the treatment, while \{HM\} specifically increased the abundances of glutathione peroxidase (GPX), peroxiredoxin, calmodulin, and decreased those of cytosolic malate dehydrogenase, d-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and glutamine synthetase. \{HM\} treatment protected fruit cells by enhancing the capabilities of stress response and defense, inhibiting substance and energy metabolism, limiting cell calcium loss. The results suggest that the self-defense capability of peach fruit was boosted by \{HM\} treatment. This study is informative in exploring the influences of \{HM\} on peach fruit ripening by demonstrating that 1-MCP and heat functioned synergistically. Biological significance To analyze the functions of differentially expressed proteins and to elucidate the response of early-maturing melting peach fruit (cv. Huiyulu) during ripening, we herein, for the first time, studied the effects of \{HM\} treatment on involved protein profiles by a proteomic approach with 2-DE and MALDI-TOF/TOF. This study successfully verified that \{HM\} functioned synergistically rather than simply superimposed on the proteome level. In addition, this study explains the molecular mechanism regarding peach fruit development and ripening on the proteome level, offers new insights into relevant physiological mechanism, and provides theoretical evidence for reinforcing quality control of post-harvest peach fruit in practice.

The major disorder is diffuse flesh discolouration (“flesh greying”, or “internal chilling injury”), but others include vascular browning, vascular leaching (browning of flesh around the vascular bundles), stringy vascular tissue (thickening and separation of the vascular strands), and outer flesh blackening (blackening of the outmost layer of the mesocarp). We have examined 1-MCP effects on ‘Hass’ avocados stored for 4 or 7 weeks at 5.5 °C following treatment with 50–1000 nl l−1 1-MCP for 6–24 h, at 6 or 15 °C. The effect of harvest date (fruit maturity) on responsiveness to 100 and 500 nl l−11-MCP was examined. 1-MCP treated fruit were firmer following storage, had reduced skin colouration (purpling) at removal from storage (4 or 7 weeks), increased time to softening, and reduced physiological disorders associated with long-term storage. Relatively little difference was observed between fruit treated at 15 and 6 °C, and thus a treatment temperature of 6 °C was used in the remaining experiments. For lower 1-MCP concentrations, short treatment durations influenced time to ripen, but not fruit quality. Treatment times of 12 and 24 h produced similar results. Harvest date (fruit maturity) influenced the levels of disorders in non-1-MCP treated fruit, but had little overall effect on 1-MCP efficacy. 1-MCP treatment was of little benefit for fruit stored for 4 weeks but, particularly if the 1-MCP concentration was high (250 nl l−1), excessively delayed the time to ripen. After 7 weeks storage 100 nl l−1 1-MCP almost completely eliminated some long-term storage disorders. A small trial showed that 500 nl l−1 1-MCP did not reduce external chilling injury (skin blackening) of ‘Hass’ avocados induced by 0 °C storage. Overall, 1-MCP shows promise as a tool for reducing internal physiological disorders due to long-term storage of ‘Hass’ avocados. "

Cavendish bananas were stored for 42 days at 15 °C under \{MA\} conditions using silicone membrane and diffusion channel systems. The respiration rate under \{MA\} at 15 °C was estimated as 20% or 60% less, or 20% greater than that measured in regular atmosphere at the same temperature. Three different silicone membrane areas (50.29, 98.56 and 158.43 cm2) and three different diffusion channel lengths (4, 7 and 10 cm) were tested. Results showed that the estimation of a 60% reduction in respiration rate was most accurate. The smallest area of silicone membrane achieved gas levels of 3.5% CO2/3% \{O2\} in about 10 days while the shortest diffusion channel achieved 5% CO2/3% O2, in 12–16 days. Fruit in these atmospheres remained unripe for 42 days, had harvest-fresh appearance, good colour, minimum mould and excellent marketability compared with controls and fruit stored in different gas compositions. In general, the silicone membrane system was found to be superior; it achieved stability more quickly than the diffusion channel system, maintained more stable gas levels throughout storage and had better physiological and sensory ratings. The diffusion channel system had higher \{CO2\} levels that may have resulted in peel discoloration in some chambers and may have affected other quality attributes. The silicone membrane system offers an inexpensive and easy to use alternative to the traditional methods used for \{MA\} storage of bananas. "

The results showed higher mass loss and polysaccharide degradation when the biological treatment was carried out with P. chrysosporium. Biodegradation curves were modelled by a Weibull kinetic model and the kinetic parameters were obtained for each one of the components. Even though the lignin degradation rates were similar for both fungi, the biodegradation of this component reached 50% with P. ostreatus, a higher value than the 41% reached with P. chrysosporium after harvesting for four weeks. Higher polysacharides biodegradation rates were observed for P. chrysosporium compared to P. ostreatus. Consequently, the P. ostreatus pretreatment can be considered adequate for the delignification of palm residues without considerably affecting the cellulose fraction, which is important for the production of fermentable sugars.

The present study focused on developing an integrated method to control postharvest diseases of banana by combining antagonistic bacteria occurring naturally in the fructosphere with hot water treatment. Twenty-five temperature and exposure time combinations were tested for their ability to control anthracnose and crown rot and their influence on postharvest quality parameters such as peel colour, hardness and Brix value of fruit. Optimum temperature and exposure time for postharvest hot water treatment of banana were determined to be 50 °C and 3 min, respectively. Temperatures higher than 50 °C reduced the colour of fruit peel and gave a pale appearance to fruit even after ripening. Exposure times longer than 5 min substantially reduced the Brix value. A member of the Burkholderia cepacia complex, isolated from the fructosphere of banana was effective as an antagonist of postharvest pathogens even after 5 years of storage in sterile distilled water at ambient temperature. The isolate of B. cepacia used was different from the already identified species of the B. cepacia complex. The most effective concentration of B. cepacia was determined to be 1010 CFU/ml for in vivo control of anthracnose and crown rot. The most effective control was achieved by repeated dipping of bananas in bacterial solution or by adding a wetter (Tween 20) to the bacterial solution. Combining hot water treatment with the bacterial antagonist also gave more effective control of anthracnose, crown rot and blossom end rot than using the two treatments individually. Higher efficacy of this integrated method was confirmed further by its greater control of artificially infected anthracnose. The present study provides valuable options for non-chemical control of postharvest diseases of banana using an antagonistic bacterium and hot water treatment either individually or together. "

This plant growth regulator is a tool that can help scientists make major advances in understanding the role of ethylene in plants. 1-MCP prevents ethylene effects in a broad range of fruits, vegetables and floriculture crops. Effective concentrations are low and range from 2.5 nl l−1 to 1 μl l−1. Concentration interacts with temperature such that low concentrations of 1-MCP applied over longer durations may be as effective as high concentrations. 1-MCP is most commonly applied at 68–77 °F (20–25 °C), but can be used at lower temperatures in some commodities. Generally, treatment durations of 12–24 h were sufficient to achieve a full response. A variety of factors may need to be considered when using 1-MCP including cultivar, developmental stage, time from harvest to treatment, and multiple applications. Depending on the species being treated, 1-MCP may have a variety of effects on respiration, ethylene production, volatile production, chlorophyll degradation and other color changes, protein and membrane changes, softening, disorders and diseases, acidity and sugars. This review compiles what is known about the technological uses for 1-MCP, defines where discrepancies exist between reports, and aims to define areas requiring further study. "

The objectives of this work were to: (1) create quality curves for bananas stored at chilling and non-chilling temperatures; (2) create quality curves for bananas stored at a non-chilling temperatures and different RHs; (3) identify which sensory quality attribute limits the shelf life and marketability of bananas when stored at chilling and non-chilling temperatures or at different RHs; and (4) correlate subjective sensory attributes with quantitative quality measurements. Results from this study showed that temperature had a more significant impact on the quality of banana than RH. Bananas stored at temperatures higher than 10 °C were yellower and softer but had lower starch and higher soluble solids and total sugar content than those stored at lower temperatures. When stored at 2, 5 and 10 °C, bananas developed chilling injury (CI) and abnormal ripening when transferred to 20 °C. The most remarkable impact of \{RH\} on banana quality was on weight loss, which was significantly higher in fruit held below 80% \{RH\} than in fruit held in 87 or 92% RH. \{CI\} was the first sensory quality attribute to reach the limit of acceptability in fruit stored at 2, 5 and 10 °C, whereas color changes and softening limited the shelf life of bananas stored at 15 and 20 °C. Changes in color and/or softening were the two main sensory attributes that limited the shelf life of bananas stored at different RHs. Overall, for maximum quality and shelf life bananas should be stored at or above 15 °C and 92% RH. Finally, sensory attributes can be used to estimate peel color, pulp softening and sweetness, while \{SSC\} can be used as a reliable and simple method to estimate the total sugar content of bananas stored at different temperatures or different RHs.

In addition, the effect of conditioning the fruit for 4 days with 10 μl l−1 ethylene at 22 °C and 85–90% \{RH\} before being transferred to air at the same temperature and 65–70% \{RH\} was studied. The \{SOD\} activity increased during storage of fruit at 22 °C under low (55–60% RH) or high (85–90% RH) humidity, being the rate of increase higher in fruit kept under low humidity. By contrast \{GR\} decreased and a slower decline rate was observed in fruit stored at low RH. A significant reduction in the activities of \{CAT\} and \{APX\} also occurred in ‘Navelina’ oranges maintained at 85–90% RH, but not at 55–60% RH. Thus, fruit kept under high RH, which showed higher rindstaining, presented lower SOD, CAT, \{GR\} and \{APX\} activities than fruit stored under low RH. The incidence of this physiological disorder was reduced by the ethylene pre-treatment. No significant differences in the activities of these enzymes were found in fruit examined after 4 days of ethylene or air treatment. \{GR\} activity of fruit pre-treated with ethylene and then held under air was significantly higher than that of their respective control air-treated fruit. Conversely, \{CAT\} was higher in fruit continuously held under air and no significant differences in \{APX\} and \{SOD\} were found. These results indicate that SOD, CAT, \{GR\} and \{APX\} may play a role in the lower rindstaining incidence observed in ‘Navelina’ fruit continuously exposed to low RH, as compared with fruit held under high RH, while \{GR\} may be involved in the beneficial effect of ethylene reducing this non-chilling physiological disorder.

Fruit treated at 40 or 45°C showed no significant changes in quality, while fruit treated at 50°C for 60 min ripened irregularly and had flesh with white and dark colorations. Fruit treated at 60°C for 60 min ripened more slowly and had no skin or flesh symptoms of heat injury, but had lower soluble solids and pH, higher firmness and slightly higher water loss than untreated fruit. The 60°C heated fruit also showed a lesser degree of flesh browning than untreated fruit. A panel of untrained judges found no significant difference in taste or aroma. Judges did give a higher score for the flesh color of fruit treated at 60°C compared with that of untreated fruit as there was less flesh browning and a firmer flesh relative to untreated fruit. Sapote mamey fruit subjected to 60°C \{HWT\} for 60 min had relatively minor effects on fruit quality and a delayed ripening.

After the simulated marketing period, acetaldehyde, ethanol and d-limonene contents were not affected in fruit stored under treatments that included cold quarantine. In some cases, treatments that included temperature conditioning significantly increased acetaldehyde and ethanol levels, however, the amounts detected were comparable with fresh grapefruit juice. In general, the storage times involved in the treatments assayed, did not promote increases in the acetaldehyde and ethanol levels. Conversely, fruit stored at non-chilling temperatures (control treatments) had higher levels of d-limonene compared to those which underwent treatments that included cold quarantine. In addition, a significant increase in d-limonene levels between the initial time of the treatments and the end of the marketing period was observed, for all treatments, with the highest and most variables levels observed in fruit stored under control treatments. Sensory characteristics, such as sweet, acid and bitter taste and typical flavor intensity, in general, were not affected by the postharvest handling practices applied. Therefore, it can be concluded that the cold quarantine treatment and temperature conditioning may have important commercial applications for “Rouge La Toma” grapefruit (Citrus paradisi Macf.) without adversely affecting its quality.

The maintenance for a week at room temperature, after long cool storage, determined an improvement of nutritional characteristics of kiwifruits. In conclusion, fruits harvested at \{T2\} seem to improve their quality after a long storage (6 months) because they reach nutritional values similar or higher than those recorded in fruits at the harvest time. In spite of these positive results, these fruits showed a reduction in organoleptic characteristics which could negatively influence the fruit marketing.

The experiment was conducted from 2005 to 2007. The irrigation treatments were commercial irrigation as control (CI) and PRD. After 3 years of evaluation, fruit quality at harvest, measured as fruit weight, flesh firmness, and total soluble solids concentration, was similar between \{CI\} fruit and \{PRD\} fruit. Dry matter concentration (DMC) was higher in \{PRD\} fruit than in \{CI\} fruit in 2005. The fruit quality after 18 days storage at room temperature (13–18 °C and 51–56% relative humidity) was similar between \{CI\} fruit and \{PRD\} fruit. The \{DMC\} was the highest in \{PRD\} fruit in the 2005 and 2007 growing seasons, and tended to be higher in \{PRD\} fruit than in \{CI\} fruit in 2006. Total soluble solids concentration was ≈8.7% higher in \{PRD\} fruit than in \{CI\} fruit in 2007. Fruit weight loss was similar between treatments. This study suggests that water deficit via \{PRD\} did not damage fruit quality at harvest or after storage at room temperature. Additionally, \{PRD\} irrigation saved about 3240 m3 of water per hectare. Therefore, \{PRD\} can be recommended for commercial use in semi-arid regions and to those growers interested in either long-term storage or distant markets. "

The highest incidence occurred at the beginning of harvest time, affecting 25–30% of the fruit, followed by a sudden decrease to about 5–10% affected fruit. Early-maturing orchards had higher purple spot incidence at the beginning of harvest time (60%) than late-maturing orchards (&lt;30%), and tended to have higher total purple spot incidence. Low day temperature at fruit colour break was the main environmental factor correlating with annual purple spot incidence, both among years and among selected orchards. Heating plants in a greenhouse during the night greatly reduced incidence of the disorder. Sunshine also affects purple spot occurrence. The amount of affected fruit was significantly reduced, and even nullified, by keeping direct sunlight off the fruit. "

We studied the impact of epiphyte removal on coffee productivity and the potential for epiphyte harvesting in a large coffee plantation (200 ha), and measured the supply of naturally fallen epiphytes in two small coffee plantations (&lt;10 ha) unsuitable for epiphyte harvesting due to low epiphyte recovery rates following removal. Ten trees were stripped of all epiphytes (E−) and a further ten trees were used as control (E+) in the large coffee plantation. Four coffee plants under each tree canopy were selected and the production of flowers and fruits was registered over two consecutive years. Photosynthetic Active Radiation (PAR), relative humidity and temperature were also measured under the canopy of all 20 trees. To estimate the potential harvest of epiphytic bromeliads in the large coffee plantation, all the plants stripped from the ten trees were recorded. The supply of naturally fallen epiphytes was recorded in ten plots (5 × 5 m) in the two small coffee plantations. From January to June, all fallen plants inside these plots were collected monthly, identified, measured and their condition recorded. Finally, we conducted a cost-benefit analysis of epiphyte management in coffee plantations. Epiphyte removal had a significant positive effect on coffee productivity; coffee plants produced 225% and 366% more flowers and fruits, respectively. Epiphyte removal significantly increased mean PAR, but had no effect on temperature and relative humidity. At the large coffee plantation 48 species of vascular epiphytes were registered, 20 of which were bromeliads. On average 727 ± 227 bromeliad rosettes were recorded per individual tree (considering all bromeliad species). In the small coffee plantations, 33 and 37 vascular epiphyte species were recorded, 21 of which were bromeliads. Approximately 21% of fallen epiphytes at the small coffee plantations were in a condition suitable for commercialization. Considering all the species and only plants in suitable condition, approximately 2252 ± 397 and 1421 ± 166 plants ha−1 per month could be collected for commercialization from the small coffee plantations. The potential profits from the sale of bromeliads can be considerable; $ 8923 \{USD\} ha−1 y−1 from direct harvesting, and $6857 to $11070 \{USD\} ha−1 y−1 from collection from the ground. A controlled rotation system of epiphyte harvesting should be implemented in large coffee plantations in order to allow the recuperation of the epiphytic community. Collection of fallen epiphytes is recommended in the small coffee plantations that represent the majority in Central Veracruz. Appropriate management of epiphytes in shade coffee plantations could contribute to an income diversification for coffee farmers with potential for replication in other countries. "

Bioactive gibberellins (GAs), which play an important role in regulating various physiological processes, have been reported to be involved in stress responses of plant. In this study, we investigated the effect of \{GA\} on chilling injury of harvested cherry tomato fruit. We found that low temperature significantly inhibited increase of endogenous levels of gibberellic acid (GA3) in fruit. This effect was associated with lower expression of key \{GA\} metabolic genes, GA3ox1, \{GA20ox1\} and GA2ox1. \{GA3\} treatment reduced the chilling injury index, whereas treatment with paclobutrazol (PAC), a \{GA\} biosynthesis inhibitor, exacerbated chilling injury. Compared with the control, \{GA3\} treatment decreased electrolyte leakage and malondialdehyde content, increased proline content, and improved antioxidant enzyme activities. Treatment with \{PAC\} caused the opposite effects. These results suggest that endogenous \{GA\} levels were positively associated with lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress in chilled fruit. \{GA\} appears to play an important role in cold response regulation in fruit.

It is typical climacteric fruit, and the ripening process is controlled by ethylene. In this study, we compared the fruit firmness and ethylene production between non-treated fruits and fruits treated with 1 μl l−1 of 1-MCP (1-Methylcyclopropene, an ethylene inhibitor) under 4 °C or room temperature. The expression of genes involved in ethylene biosynthesis and signal transduction was investigated. Fruits harvested from different locations were also used to compare the gene expression. The results showed that 1-MCP treatment slowed down the fruit firmness drop but did not change the ethylene production very much during storage. The expression of genes involved in ethylene biosynthesis (ACS1, \{ACS4\} and ACO), reception (ERS1a) and response (PG1 and PG2) were inhibited by 1-MCP treatments, and affected by the treatment temperature. The expression of receptor gene \{ETR1a\} showed a constitutive pattern in fruits treated with or without 1-MCP at room temperature, but was induced in treatment under 4 °C. In the fruit harvested from colder area (Shenyang), the ethylene production was higher and fruit firmness was lower than that in fruit harvested from warmer area (Anshan). Moreover, the expression of ethylene biosynthesis and receptor genes was lower in fruit from Shenyang than that from Anshan. \{PG2\} was expressed earlier in fruits from Shenyang than those from Anshan and may play more important role in fruit softening. The possible mechanism under the expression patterns was discussed. "

The inhibition percentage of M. fructicola with \{HWB\} were similar, if \{HWB\} was applied shortly after inoculation or 24 h later. In contrast, the sensitivity of P. expansum spores inoculated into wounds increased when the fruit were treated with \{HWB\} 24 h after the inoculation, compared with treatment just after inoculation. The combination of \{HWB\} with the application of yeast antagonists was also investigated. We found that treating fruit with \{HWB\} at 60 °C for 20 s and then dipping them into a cell suspension (108 cells per ml) of Candida spp. 24 h after inoculation with P. expansum reduced decay development by 60% compared with the controls. Another yeast antagonist, Candida oleophila was inferior in its ability to control Penicillium expansum and M. fructicola compared with other Candida spp. The combination of \{HWB\} and Candida spp. showed no significant additional effect against M. fructicola, compared with \{HWB\} alone. \{HWB\} alone, at 60 °C for 20 s, reduced brown rot development to very low rates. In storage experiments covering 30 days at 0 °C and 10 days of shelf life, \{HWB\} and Candida spp. applied separately were each able to reduce natural decay incidence to commercially acceptable levels (&lt;5%), and combining them showed no additional effect. \{SEM\} analysis showed a direct effect of \{HWB\} mainly on M. fructicola.

We have shown that the increase in ethylene production and \{PAL\} are cold-induced responses which are only stimulated in fruit of citrus cultivars showing chilling damage and that both responses may occur concomitantly with the development of chilling symptoms. However, the magnitude of these responses was not indicative of the degree of tolerance of a specific cultivar to chilling. The influence of fruit age on both responses was evaluated in the most (‘Navelina’) and the least (‘Fortune’) chilling tolerant cultivars. Chilling damage was not developed in ‘Navelina’ fruit at any physiological stage, but our results in ‘Fortune’ mandarins, which always developed chilling symptoms, indicated that the induction of \{PAL\} in response to chilling was dependent on the fruit physiological stage. Interestingly, increases in both \{PAL\} mRNA and activity were barely affected by cold stress in the youngest ‘Fortune’ fruit harvested in December in spite of its noticeable CI. For a similar \{CI\} index, the older the fruit, the higher was the shift in the levels of \{PAL\} transcript and in \{PAL\} activity in response to cold. In contrast, the cold-induced ethylene production was little affected by the physiological stage of the fruit. "

To assess tolerance to high air temperature during two key stages—microsporogenesis (3–6 days before flowering, DBF) and flowering, fruit-set was measured in two experiments. In the first experiment, 12 genotypes were exposed to short (3–6 days) episodes of high (38 °C) day air temperature at 6 \{DBF\} and at flowering. In the second experiment, 22 genotypes were exposed to 40 °C day air temperature for 1 day at 6 DBF, 3 \{DBF\} or at flowering. Cellular membrane thermostability (relative injury, RI) was also measured in these 22 genotypes. There was considerable variation among genotypes in response to high temperature, whether assessed by growth rates, fruit-set or RI. Pod weight at high soil temperature was associated with variation in \{CGR\} rather than partitioning. Flowering was more sensitive to high air temperature than microsporogenesis. Genotypes tolerant to high air temperature at microsporogenesis were not necessarily tolerant at flowering, and nor was tolerance correlated with RI. Six genotypes (796, 55–437, \{ICG\} 1236, \{ICGV\} 86021, \{ICGV\} 87281 and \{ICGV\} 92121) were identified as heat tolerant based on their performance in all tests.

Bruise prediction models were constructed for the apple cultivar ‘Jonagold’, with impacts controlled by a pendulum. Multiple linear and nonlinear regression models were built to link fruit factors such as ripeness, acoustic stiffness, fruit temperature, radius of curvature and harvest date, with bruise damage. Bruise volume was used as a measure for apple bruising. Significant main effects and significant interactions between fruit factors were identified. Interactions between fruit factors (e.g. interaction between harvest date and stiffness), along with interactions between fruit factors and the degree of bruising, were identified. Most of the effects of those fruit factors on bruise damage could be explained by applying theoretical bruise models described in the literature. "

We carried out pollen monitoring analyses over a 12-year period, to initially define the main dynamics of pollen release into the atmosphere in a typical olive production area in southern Italy (Fasano, Puglia). Pollen release was generally determined by the meteorological factors in the period before flowering, with effects on both pollen amounts and timing of flowering (early or delayed). The interactions between these pollen and meteorological parameters were investigated using principal component analysis. This revealed clusters of independent variables during the biological cycle of the olive that highlighted the relationships between annual pollen production and future fruit production, with a high degree of interaction between environmental factors and final olive oil quality. This led us to search for statistical relationships between quality parameters of the oil (acidity, oxidative degree, fatty-acid composition) and meteorological parameters (mean monthly temperatures, rainfall, humidity, winds, solar radiation, evapotranspiration during post-flowering/pre-harvest). The water stress, as defined by the potential evapotranspiration, has a large influence on acidity and fatty-acid content of the olive oil produced. These data thus provide further support of the need for quality irrigation in olive production. "

Intermittent warming (IW) has been proposed as a potential solution to enhance successful long-term pepper fruit storage. To understand the influence of \{IW\} in alleviating \{CI\} in peppers, the effects of 3 \{IW\} cycles were tested on the organic acid content, firmness, and relative enzyme content of pepper fruit (namely, 1–3 \{IW\} cycles to 20 °C for 24 h every 7 days for fruit stored at 4 °C for 27 days). Subsequently, the effects of 2 \{IW\} cycles were tested on the organizational structure of pepper fruit cells and potential odor changes. The results showed that \{IW\} effectively reduces the \{CI\} index and maintains pepper firmness. Following 2 \{IW\} cycles after 6 and 13 days storage, pepper integrity was retained, with no shrinkage or decay. Furthermore, partial least squares analysis of odor changes showed that both 1 \{IW\} cycle after 20 days storage and 2 \{IW\} cycles after 6 and 13 days storage extended storage time to over 10 days. The appropriate \{IW\} cycles effectively delay the decline in unsaturated fatty acid content and maintain a higher index of unsaturated fatty acids (IUFA), which helps retain the integrity of the pepper cell membranes.

There was a significant decline in malic acid and sucrose contents during storage, with a more rapid decrease at higher temperatures. Skin colour and carotenoids progressively developed during the first 30 days of storage, and then remained steady for the remainder of the storage period. The cryptoxanthin content increased 2.4-fold in fruit stored at 20 and 30°C, but increased only slightly or underwent a small decrease in fruit stored at ≤10°C.

abstract = "Abstract In this study, important quality properties such as firmness, sugar and acid levels were measured and analysed in tomatoes harvested from three greenhouses during a five month period and stored at 16 °C for over 20 days. Tomatoes were harvested from three identical, neighbouring, greenhouses which were either conventionally ventilated (open greenhouse) or mechanically cooled (semi-closed greenhouses). Sugar and acids levels were hardly affected by greenhouse type. Compared to the open greenhouse, semi-closed greenhouses produced heavier and less mature (firmer) fruit at the commercial harvesting stage based on colour. Fruit maturity differences could be linked to the vertical temperature gradient and to \{CO2\} levels in the different greenhouses. This indicates that \{CO2\} levels and temperature affect the synchronisation between colour and firmness maturity at harvest. The acceptance period, i.e., the time period both tomato colour and firmness are considered acceptable by consumers, will likely be positively affected when growers switch from conventionally ventilated to semi-closed production systems. Additional to greenhouse effects also effects of the harvest month were observed. The sugar to acid ratio was highest and glucose to fructose ratio was lowest in July, the month with the highest irradiance, irrespective of greenhouse type. The estimated value for the maximum firmness (Fmax) varied from 17.9 N in August to 31.2 N in June. This monthly variation in Fmax explains an important part of the variation found in the postharvest behaviour of tomatoes. Interestingly, the monthly variation in Fmax showed the same trend as found for the monthly initial sugar levels. It might be hypothesised that the monthly variation in glucose and fructose levels causes variation in that part of firmness that is generated by cell turgor. The monthly variation in Fmax, sugar and acid levels could not be linked to climate conditions and remains to be elucidated. "

Fruits of this species are borne mainly on the canopy periphery, and the delicate skin is easily damaged during windy conditions (wind-scar). Pruning, as well as fruit drop caused by strong winds, stimulates re-bloom of carambola trees. In subtropical southern Florida, cool temperatures and dry winds during the winter inhibit tree growth and shorten the production season to July–February. Crop value is greatest during the early part of the season. We evaluated manual, selective pruning and crop removal as techniques for increasing production of early-season fruit in ‘Arkin’ carambola. Pruning 3–4-year old branches to their main axes in early March (late winter in the Northern Hemisphere) resulted in flowering during mid-April (mid-spring) and a crop by the end of June (early summer), whereas harvest of intact, non-pruned trees began 4–5 weeks later. Pruned branches produced 15 kg (November pruning) to 24 kg of fruit (July pruning). Selectively pruned branches deep within the tree canopy did not appear to be moved by wind as much as branches along the canopy periphery. Thus, fruit from pruned branches were nearly 100% free of wind-scar and had excellent appearance. In comparison, more than 58% of fruit harvested from the canopy periphery had wind-scar, with only ca. 20% free from such damage. Crop removal in November or December (mid–late-autumn) increased early bloom and the amount of early fruit produced in the summer. De-fruited trees produced an average of 48 kg per tree of early fruit, harvested July 7, whereas non-de-fruited trees produced an average of only 5 kg per tree. "

In addition, the combined effect of genotype and postharvest ripening on phytochemical content of peach and nectarines has not been elucidated. In the present study, the \{IAD\} maturity index, ripening-related parameters, phenolic and flavonoid contents and in vitro antioxidant capacity were determined in fruit from 26 commercially important peach and nectarine cultivars, grown in Greece. Analyses were carried out at harvest and after additional ripening at room temperature (∼23 ± 2 °C) for 1, 3 and 5 days, to simulate shelf life conditions. Results indicated great variation in the \{IAD\} index (variation coefficient = 32%); this index can be used as reference in future studies on a cultivar basis. Flesh firmness was the strongest predicted parameter from the \{IAD\} index during off-tree ripening. Segregation of peach and nectarine cultivars revealed great differences on quality parameters and on their ripening behavior. Varietal differences were more pronounced regarding the polyphenolic content; indicatively, total phenol (TP) content ranged from 11.7 to 90.1 mg gallic acid equivalents (GAE) 100−1 g fresh weight (FW) at harvest. ‘Sun Cloud’ and ‘Gladys’ fruits among peach cultivars and ‘Tasty Free’ fruits among nectarine cultivars demonstrated high antioxidant contents. Interestingly, postharvest ripening of peach and nectarine cultivars did not seem to affect polyphenolic content and antioxidant capacity in a constant mode. Hence \{IAD\} was not correlated with antioxidant contents and to our knowledge this is the first work examining this correlation. Furthermore, data underlines that peach cultivars in general were characterized by higher antioxidant contents compared to nectarine cultivars; this was also the case for late-harvested cultivars versus the early-harvested ones.

In this study, GC–MS and RNA-Seq were employed to characterize the metabolite and transcriptomic profiles during postharvest storage under room temperature (RT) and low temperature (LT) in Powell (Citrus sinensis) fruits. Results showed that RT-storage up-regulated genes involved in primary metabolism including sucrose metabolism, glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, fermentation and \{GABA\} shunt pathways, resulting in declines of sucrose and organic acids such as malate, citrate and α-ketoglutaric acid, and accumulations of hexoses and GABA. Furthermore, calcium-sensor proteins were strongly induced including CMLs, CBL-CIPKs and CPKs, indicating the potential roles of calcium signaling during postharvest storage under RT. RT-storage enhanced \{ABA\} and ethylene signaling pathways via up-regulation of PYLs, \{ABI5\} and ERFs, which revealed hormone regulatory networks on fruit senescence. In addition, the induced RPLs, \{NAC\} and \{WRKY\} transcription factors and \{MAP\} kinases provided a comprehensive view on the fruit senescence regulation. During \{LT\} storage, the levels of metabolites and catabolism related genes were substantially maintained, and auxin signal was modulated by upregulation of \{TIR1\} and downregulation of Aux/IAAs. In summary, \{RT\} storage accelerates calcium, \{ABA\} and ethylene signals, which could positively regulate fruit senescence and result in induced primary metabolism and fruit quality deterioration. \{LT\} storage might accelerate the auxin signal, thus delaying senescence and maintaining fruit quality.

Control options are limited, mainly due to a lack of understanding of the disease cycle. Therefore, this study aimed to determine potential sources of Alternaria spp. inoculum in the orchard and examine their relative contribution throughout the production season. Leaf residue from the orchard floor, canopy leaves, twigs and buds were collected monthly from three apple orchards for two years and examined for the number of spores on their surface. In addition, the effects of climatic factors on spore production dynamics in each plant part were examined. Although all four plant parts tested contributed to the Alternaria inoculum in the orchard, significant higher numbers of spores were obtained from leaf residue than the other plant parts supporting the hypothesis that overwintering of Alternaria spp. occurred mainly in leaf residue and minimally on twigs and buds. The most significant period of spore production on leaf residue occurred from dormancy until bloom and on canopy leaves and twigs during the fruit growth stage. Temperature was the single most significant factor influencing the amount of Alternaria inoculum and rainfall and relative humidity showed strong associations with temperature influencing the spore production dynamics in Australian orchards. The practical implications of this study include the eradication of leaf residue from the orchard floor and sanitation of the canopy after harvest to remove residual spores from the trees. "

Marquette is a cold hardy hybrid with Vitis riparia in its parentage, a source of cold hardiness and rapid budburst characteristics. In 2012 and 2013, the capacity of Marquette to rebound from significant bud mortality from a series of spring freeze events was quantified and the capacity of recovering the damages the following year, measuring vine yield and the effect on fruit quality. The compound bud on grapevine is actually three buds in one, with primary, secondary, and tertiary all present. Spring freeze events in 2012 killed over 80% of the shoots arising from primary buds (SPB) while secondary buds (SSB) were almost unaffected. By tracking the performance \{SPB\} and SSB, we were able to quantify vine response to spring freeze events. A comparative analysis of phenological and fruit quality characteristics of the \{SPB\} and \{SSB\} clusters showed different development and ripening of those of SBS. However, the differences disappeared at harvest, with no significant impact on yield or only partially on fruit composition. The results suggest that Marquette has the potential to generate significant yield from \{SSB\} with desirable fruit quality and could offer a solution to spring freeze losses. In 2013, year characterized by no spring freeze events, vines recovered full productivity, yielding 61% more fruit, due to an increased number of cluster per vine (+60%) with also better fruit quality at harvest.

Brown rot control was similarly controlled when the same concentration of \{PAA\} was applied with a PAA-based commercial product. In order to reduce \{PAA\} concentration, combinations of different concentrations and temperatures were evaluated. A treatment of 200 mg L−1 of \{PAA\} at 40 °C for 40 s was selected to control pre-existing and future infections, different inoculum concentrations of M. fructicola and to control brown rot on naturally infected fruit. Brown rot was completely controlled with the selected treatment when peaches and nectarines were inoculated 0 h before the treatment but it was not controlled when infection time was increased to 24, 48 and 72 h. Also, the treatment significantly controlled brown rot at all inoculum concentrations evaluated (103, 104, 105 and 106 conidia mL−1) in both peaches and nectarines, but no protection against future infections was observed. In naturally infected fruit, brown rot incidence was slightly but significantly reduced to 61 and 36% in ‘Roig d’Albesa’ and ‘Placido’ peaches, respectively, but not in nectarines. Immersion for 40 s in 200 mg L−1 of \{PAA\} at 40 °C provides an alternative treatment to control only recent infections of Monilinia spp. whatever their concentration without generally affecting fruit quality.

The storage temperature effect was successfully described by the Arrhenius law. These results represent a good predictive tool for tomato quality estimation along the food chain. "

The \{HWT\} treatment increased \{CAT\} activity in the fruit, but after they were removed from high temperature to cold storage a rapid decline in \{CAT\} activity was associated with increased chilling injury. Greater chilling tolerance and \{CAT\} activity was induced when fruits were conditioned for 3 days at 37°C and 90–95% RH. The \{CAT\} activity in fruits exposed to \{HAT\} was higher than in the dipped and the non-heated fruits over the storage period at 2°C. An inhibitor of \{CAT\} activity, 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (AT), caused peel damage in \{HAT\} ‘Fortune’ mandarins and in the chilling-tolerant ‘Clementine’ and ‘Clemenules’ cultivars stored at 2°C but not at 12°C (non-chilling temperature). \{CAT\} activity was reduced about two to three times by \{AT\} upon cold storage in the cultivars studied. Little difference was found in the activity of ascorbate peroxidase (APX), glutathione reductase (GR) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) between AT-treated and non-treated fruits. The data indicate that \{CAT\} may be a major antioxidant enzyme involved in the defence mechanism of mandarin fruits against chilling stress.

In vitro evaluations were carried out to observe mycelial growth, sporulation and conidial germination. Evaluations on fruit were percentage and disease severity, soluble solids content (SSC) and weight loss after 4 days storage at ambient temperature.

Subsequent sealing of hot water-dipped fruit improved the positive effect but was not essential for the success of treatment. In our experiments, addition of fungicides (imazalil or thiabendazole, 1000 ppm) to the hot dip did not increase significantly the CI-reducing effect, but prevented fruit decay. Hot water dip also reduced decay of citrus fruits stored both at low and optimal temperatures, demonstrating an effect comparable to that of curing. An increased level of putrescine was observed in hot water-dipped grapefruit and lemons. Compared with curing, hot water dip was much easier to implement and could be combined with regular packing-house treatment procedures. "

In this study, the respective roles of cell number and cell filling rate in the development of pulp dry weight are estimated. To this end, the source/sink ratio in the plant was altered at different stages of fruit development. Leaf shading (reducing resource availability), bunch bagging (increasing sink activity by increasing fruit temperature), and bunch trimming (decreasing sink size by fruit pruning), applied once cell division had finished, showed that the pulp filling rate depends on resource availability. Bunch bagging and bunch trimming were also carried out before the end of cell division to estimate the role of pulp cell number in the development of pulp dry weight. A sampling method was calibrated to evaluate pulp cell number from the digestion of a fixed portion of the pulp in a solution of chromic and nitric acids. A relationship was found between pulp cell number and fruit length at the end of cell division. It was observed that pulp cell number is a determining factor in pulp dry weight variability within a bunch. On the other hand, the cell filling rate was identical for all fruits in the bunch and was influenced by the source/sink ratio. A Michaelis-Menten relationship was invoked to relate the cell filling rate in a bunch to the source/sink ratio during bunch filling. "

For this purpose, ReTain containing 15% aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG) was applied to the peach fruits. 150 ppm dose of \{AVG\} was sprayed on the fruits 7 days before commercial harvest. Harvested fruits were transported to Postharvest Physiology Laboratory of Horticulture Department immediately. \{AVG\} treated and control fruits were stored at 0 °C temperature and 90 ± 5% relative humidity conditions during 6 weeks in air and 8 weeks in controlled atmosphere conditions. Weight loss, fruit flesh firmness, titratable acidity, soluble solid contents, fruit color, ethylene production, respiration rate and sensory analyses (external appearance, taste and aroma) were determined at the beginning and during the storage period with 2 weeks intervals. In this research, the maturation of the AVG-treated fruits was delayed compared to the control groups. The weight loss was increased by \{AVG\} application compared to the control fruits in both \{NA\} and CA. End of the storage, the lowest and highest fruit firmness was found to be 58.69 N (in NA)-58.28 N (in CA) and 83.54 N (in NA)-75.66 N (in CA) in control treatment and \{AVG\} treatment, respectively. In addition, titratable acidity of the fruits decreased and soluble solid contents increased during the storage period. The ethylene production level was lower (0.034 and 0.035 μL/kg h) than that of control fruits (0.068 and 0.100 μL/kg h) at the beginning as well as at the end of the storage, respectively in \{NA\} and that these results similarly in CA. It is concluded that pre-harvest \{AVG\} application (150 ppm) 7 days before commercial harvest to ‘Monroe’ peaches can increase financial returns to growers through increased fruit size and quality benefits as well as maintain a higher flesh firmness following post-harvest storage and export.

Various heat treatments, including prestorage conditioning regimes of 3 days at 21°C and 7 days at 16°C, a hot water dip (HWD) at 53°C for 2 min, a hot water brushing (HWB) treatment at 60°C for 30 s, and curing (3 days at 36°C) achieved 70–90% reduction in the chilling injury (CI) index, as compared with control untreated fruit, following 6 weeks of cold storage at 2°C and an additional week at 20°C. Of the various treatments that induced cold tolerance, only \{HWB\} significantly reduced postharvest decay development. Conditioning and curing, which required longer exposure periods of 3–7 days at relatively high temperatures, significantly increased fruit weight loss, enhanced peel color alteration, and increased the juice TSS/acid ratios. On the other hand, the short postharvest heat treatments, including the \{HWD\} at 53°C for 2 min and the \{HWB\} at 60°C for 30 s, did not affect fruit weight loss, color, or \{TSS\} and acidity levels. Overall, it is concluded that short postharvest heat treatments, including either \{HWD\} or \{HWB\} are preferable, since they effectively induce tolerance to cold temperatures in ‘Star Ruby’ grapefruit without impairing any other postharvest qualities. Of these treatments, the new \{HWB\} is faster and could be used to clean and disinfect the fruit, and simultaneously to enhance its \{CI\} tolerance. "

Our objective was to use a crop model to improve pineapple management practices according to the diversity of conditions on Reunion Island. Farm surveys resulted in the definition of eleven criteria describing the diversity of pineapple practices to characterize pineapple farm-type: ridges, tillage, planting density, level of N fertilization and number of N application, harvest date, irrigation, farm diversification, elevation, weather and location. Three types were then identified: 1) pineapples with sugarcane the main crop located at low elevation; 2) pineapples only located at high elevation; 3) diversified farms including pineapples located at low elevation. The SIMPIÑA model was used to identify a set of best practices for each farm-type, based on fruit quality (TSS/TA), agronomic (yield), economic (income at selling), and environmental criteria (N leaching). Producing large fruits seems to be the condition to increase agronomic and economic criteria, regarless pineapple farm-type because prices of products is higher for large fruit on local market. As a result, promising management sequences selected with the model underestimated the importance of selling small fruits at local market. Overall, a decrease of level of N fertilization could reduce N leaching without reducing yield and fruit quality. This study demonstrates that multi-criteria crop simulation models used with an optimization approach provide a framework suitable for designing new management strategies of pineapple production, while taking the type of pineapple farms into account.

The factors that induce the cracking are unknown, however we previously demonstrated that the intensity of the disorder can be controlled by application of a mixture of synthetic gibberellins (GA4 plus GA7) and cytokinin (6-benzyladenine; BA) at different phenological stages of fruit development, and suggested that the plant growth regulators (PGRs) affect the elasticity of the epidermal layer at the calyx-end by increasing cell density. The present study focused on histological analyses of the peel at the calyx-end following the application of \{BA\} + GA4+7. The experiments were conducted in Northern Israel during 2011 and 2012. In 2011 the \{PGRs\} were applied as 0.2% (v/v) Superlon™ (i.e., 40 mg l−1 \{BA\} plus 40 mg l−1 GA4+7) once, twice or three times every 14 days since 60 days after full bloom (DAFB). In 2012, to test the efficacy of a lower concentration of the PGRs, 0.025% (v/v) Superlon™ was used. Spraying was applied at 60 to 90 \{DAFB\} (cell expansion phase) as before, in addition to earlier spraying at 7 to 35 \{DAFB\} (cell division phase). In all treatments given at cell expansion phase the \{BA\} + GA4+7 mixture increased the epidermal cell density at the calyx-end, compared to control. Multiple spraying maintained the high cell density during fruit expansion compared to one-time application, and the higher concentration of the \{PGRs\} was more potent than the lower. Assessment of calyx-end cracking suggested that low concentration of the \{PGRs\} (i.e., 5 mg l−1 \{BA\} plus 5 mg l−1 GA4+7) is most efficient when applied three times at cell division phase. Interestingly, in 2011 the incidence of calyx-end cracking was significantly lower relative to 2012 and 2010 that were characterized by extended daily hours of high temperatures (&gt;34 °C). This association can be used by growers as a criterion in applying the \{PGR\} treatment early in the season when temperatures are higher than the average and high incidence of calyx-end cracking might be expected.

Cooled fruit ripened at 15°C showed an anomalous respiration rate and ethylene production after the climacteric peak, a loss of firmness and a drop in titratable acidity after 7 days of storage, and reduced endo-polygalacturonase activity in presence of continuous pectinmethylesterase activity during the first week.

Additionally, \{NO\} treatment reduced natural anthracnose incidence and severity of mango fruit ripened at ambient temperature, and the values of both parameters from 4 to 10 d of storage in NO-treated fruit averaged 40 and 45% lower, respectively, than those for control fruit. \{NO\} did not exhibit in vitro antifungal activity against C. gloeosporioides. \{NO\} treatment enhanced the activities of defense-related enzymes including phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), cinnamate-hydroxylase (C4H), 4-coumarate: CoA ligase (4CL), peroxidase (POD), β-1,3-glucanase (GLU) and chitinase (CHT). \{NO\} treatment also promoted the accumulation of total phenolics, flavonoids and lignin that might contribute to inhibition of the pathogen. In addition to antifungal efficacy, \{NO\} treatment delayed flesh softening, yellowing, and changes in soluble solids content (SSC) and titratable acidity (TA), and peaks of respiration rate and ethylene production during ripening. These results suggest that the resistance of NO-treated mango to anthracnose may be attributed to activation of defense responses as well as delay of ripening. "

Texture can be determined by both subjective (direct human evaluation) and objective (quantitative instruments such as shear and pressure testers) methods. A large number of factors affect the texture of a plant product. This review will focus on the preharvest factors that influence texture. Abiotic factors such as available soil moisture, temperature, relative humidity, and nutrient availability directly influence texture. There is also a genetic influence on texture, and cultivars within a species vary significantly in textural attributes. Within a cultivar there is often a large difference in texture associated with maturity at the time of harvest. The preharvest environmental, cultural, physiological and genetic factors affecting texture will be discussed in general, with emphasis given to preharvest plant nutrition as it affects textural quality of fruits and vegetables.

The air temperature surrounding a block of orchard trees was elevated by enclosing in a polythene tunnel from bloom in May until harvest in early September; throughout this period the trees were irrigated. A second block of trees was covered partially with a polythene tunnel, with the intention of providing a similar light regime as in the complete polytunnel, but without raising the temperature. To examine the effects of irrigation, some trees outside the polytunnels received irrigation while others did not. Detailed continuous measurements of the canopy climate, particularly temperature, were made until harvest. Throughout the growing season, fruit size was measured repeatedly and non-destructively to calculate fruit volume and fruit growth rates. The largest `Cox' and `Queen Cox' fruits were obtained from the trees grown in the complete polytunnel with irrigation, where the higher temperature was associated with fewer fruit being retained and the individual fruit growing more than those at the lower temperature. Fruit on trees in the partial tunnel with irrigation, and outside with irrigation, were similar in size. The smallest fruit were produced on the non-irrigated trees outside. The mean cortical cell area of the `Cox' fruit from non-irrigated trees outside was not significantly smaller than that from either the outside irrigated (OI) or the polytunnel-grown (PT) fruits: despite this, differences in cell area, rather than cell number, were a more likely explanation for the effects of temperature or irrigation on final fruit size. The increases in fruit size were associated with a greater loss of fruit texture and quality during storage than in smaller fruit from non-irrigated trees. "

At higher temperatures, expression of ethylene biosynthesis genes (ACS1a and ACO) and ethylene receptor genes (ETR2, ERS1a, and ETR1a) increased, while \{CTR1\} expression decreased. Multiple linear regressions between relative expression of these genes after 0 d and fruit firmness after 6 d during ripening at 20 °C were conducted.

An electronic modulation system was used to keep the increase on UV-B rate at constant levels throughout the day. The parameters evaluated were latent infection of fungi, dry matter of plants, physico-chemical attributes, color of the peel and fruit production. There was no significant difference among the irradiation treatments regarding the incidence of Rhizopus nigricans and Botrytis cinerea at both seasons. Independently on the season and the irradiation treatment, the incidence of R. nigricans was higher than the B. cinerea and this was considered the main postharvest fungi in the experiment. The incidence of Colletotrichum acutatum was limited to second season and it was higher on UV-B(+) treatment. The irradiation treatments had no influence on the dry matter, fruit production, the physico-chemical parameters and color. A strong correlation of both average temperature and precipitation on the incidence of R. nigricans and B. cinerea three weeks before harvesting was detected on both seasons using the Pearson correlation coefficients. The incidence of R. nigricans was positively correlated with precipitation and negatively correlated with average temperature. The inverse has been observed for B. cinerea. The results indicate that, on environmental conditions of a higher UV-B radiation, the probability of spoilage of strawberry fruit would be increased only by C. acutatum incidence. "

abstract = "Abstract The involvement of ethylene gas in the ripening of peach fruit is a symbolic phenomenon that has a place in the history of research on plant hormones. It is well documented that fruit ripening is developmentally regulated and affected by environmental factors such as temperature and light. Blue light has been shown to induce pigment synthesis in postharvest fruit. However, information on its effect on fruit ripening is still limited. This study aimed to investigate the effect of light-emitting diode blue light treatment at 40 μmol m−2 s−1 on fruit ripening, ethylene biosynthesis and signalling in postharvest peaches during storage at 10 °C. Blue light exposure induced fruit ripening as expressed by the enhanced decline of fruit firmness and increases in skin colour parameters, which was associated with the increase in ethylene production because of the up-regulated expression of PpLOXs and ethylene biosynthetic genes such as PpACO1 and PpACS3. Meanwhile, six genes in relation to ethylene perception and signalling were also investigated using real-time PCR. Among them, blue light treatment significantly inhibited expression of PpERS1 and enhanced transcript levels of PpEIN2, PpEIL1, PpEIL2 and PpERF2, which led to an induction ethylene signalling pathway and resulted in turn into the promotion of ethylene production and fruit softening in postharvest peaches. Compared to control fruit stored at darkness, higher expression level of ethylene biosynthetic and signalling genes in blue light exposed peaches could be beneficial for its ethylene production and consequently fruit ripening.

Bananas produced at six sites, under very different conditions, during three different periods of the year, were harvested at the same temperature sum and ripened under identical conditions. The peel of green bananas harvested during the hot humid season was not as hard as that of bananas harvested during the cool dry season. In ripe bananas, an increasing correlation was noted between the rainfall level and fruit firmness (R = 0.88) and peel hardness (R = 0.80). This correlation could explain why bananas produced during the dry season were less firm and, conversely, those produced in highland areas, where rainfall is highest, were firmer. In ripe bananas, a decreasing correlation was also noted between the mean daily temperature and the fruit yellowness (R = 0.84). This interaction could be responsible for the yellower colour of mountain banana pulp and of bananas harvested during the coolest seasons. The green life of bananas harvested during the hot humid season was shorter than that of bananas harvested during the dry and intermediate seasons. "

The cover reduced the incident radiation by up to 54% PAR, \{UV\} by up to 22% UV-A and UV-B up to 2% and increased day temperature indoors. Fruit were as firm in the early varieties grown under cover as those in the field and slightly softer than in the late harvesting cultivars. Sugar content was slightly less in four of the five varieties; no differences in acidity and sugar/acid ratio as a taste indicator were found. Fruits were up to 3 mm larger when grown under cover in cvs. ‘Burlat’ and ‘Souvenir’, but no differences were observed in cvs. ‘Earlise’ and ‘Prime Giant’. Fruit of three cultivars, ‘Burlat’, ‘Samba’ and ‘Prime Giant’ can be classified as premium quality with 28 mm–30 mm diameter, when grown under cover. Overall, all cherry fruit were of the market, i.e. consumer- preferred, dark red colouration in line with enhanced anthocyanin contents. In two cultivars, the cover induced healthier fruit. Antioxidative capacity was larger in cv. ‘Samba’, while ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) was increased in cv. ‘Souvenir’; phenols were enhanced in all cultivars and attributed to heat stress. Allergenic protein (Pru av 1) in cherry fruits of both cultivation types were below the detection level at harvest time, indicating that cultivation under cover had no adverse effects on this particular health component. Overall, forcing successfully resulted in 2 weeks earlier ripening, thereby providing the first fresh and healthy (low allergen, high phenolic compounds and high anthocyanin) German cherries of high fruit quality on the market in spring.

In this study, efficacy of C. sake (5 × 107 \{CFU\} mL−1), which was applied with the additive Fungicover (FC; 50 g L−1), was tested against \{BBR\} in the laboratory and in field trials under the Atlantic climate conditions of the Bordeaux region (France). The study also evaluated the survival of C. sake under T and \{RH\} regimes simulated in climatic chambers. Two or five applications of C. sake plus \{FC\} during the growing season significantly reduced \{BBR\} severity at harvest by 48% and 82%, respectively, when compared to the control. Similar reductions were achieved after inoculation with selected virulent Botrytis cinerea strains (75% compared to control) in laboratory experiments. C. sake populations showed minimal decreases between field applications and were favored by simulated Atlantic climate conditions. The survival pattern of C. sake exposed to 40 and 45 °C combined with 30% and 100% of \{RH\} was described, demonstrating a sharp decrease during the first 24 h. Allowing 48 h for C. sake to incubate and become established on fruits prior to the exposure to 40 °C and 30% \{RH\} increased survival (P &lt; 0.05). These results confirm the efficacy of treatment with C. sake plus \{FC\} under favorable climatic conditions for \{BBR\} development, while survival studies may help to improve the survival and efficacy of yeast BCAs, such as C. sake CPA-1.

To address this, partially de-husked mature Makapuno coconut fruit were stored at 2, 5 or 30 °C and were then evaluated after transferring to 30 °C for 3 days to simulate conditions in retail markets. During storage at 30 °C, the fruit showed a moderate respiration rate of 40–60 mg \{CO2\} kg−1 h−1, a low ethylene production rate of 0.6–0.8 μL \{C2H4\} kg−1 h−1 and storage life was 3 days. In contrast, storage at 2 °C or 5 °C markedly reduced respiration rates to 4 and 20 mg \{CO2\} kg−1 h−1, respectively, and storage-life increased dramatically from 3 days to 6 weeks. Generally, cold storage delayed fruit deterioration by limiting weight loss, kernel browning and malondialdehyde content, however, after the fruits were transferred to 30 °C, those previously held at 2 °C showed signs of chilling injury, while those held at 5 °C did not. Modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) using high oxygen transmission rate (OTR) bags in combination with 5 °C storage extended fruit storage-life 20-fold, from 3 days at ambient conditions to 10 weeks. The combination of \{MAP\} and 5 °C storage reduced weight loss (4-fold), the incidence of surface mold and the quality parameters measured were comparable to values in freshly harvested fruit. "

The study was designed with emphasis on shade cover variation within each of the two study areas, while minimizing the variability of environment, agronomic management other than shade, and post-harvest processing. 46 samples of shade coffee and 46 samples of sun coffee were evaluated for physical and sensorial attributes using three professional coffee cuppers (assessors). A principal component analysis including all quality and environmental variables showed that sensory attributes were influenced negatively by shade, and that physical attributes were influenced positively by altitude. A mixed linear model, with coffee cupper and farm as random variables, revealed different shade effects on coffee quality in the two areas. In Oporapa, situated at high altitudes, shade had a negative effect on fragrance, acidity, body, sweetness and preference of the beverage, while no effect was found on the physical quality. In Timaná, situated at lower altitudes, shade did not have a significant effect on sensorial attributes, but significantly reduced the number of small beans. At high altitudes with low temperatures and no nutrient or water deficits, shade trees may thus have a partly adverse effect on C. arabica cv. Caturra resulting in reduced sensory quality. The occurrence of berry borer (Hypothenemus hampei) was lower at high altitudes and higher under shade. Future studies on shade and coffee quality should focus on the interaction between physical and chemical characteristics of beans. "

The coated eggplants were stored at two different temperatures [10°C and (30±2)°C] and examined for weight loss, firmness, stem color, shriveling, total soluble solids, pH, acidity, vitamin C, sugar (total sugar, reducing sugar and non-reducing sugar) and N, P, K, Ca and Na for two weeks. The obtained results showed that weight loss, shriveling, total soluble solids, pH, sugar (total sugar and non-reducing sugar) increased and firmness, stem color, acidity, reducing sugar, vitamin C minimized during the storage period. The 0.5% Aloe coating at 10°C showed significant effect and delayed the changes in above parameters. Aloe vera coating remained almost ineffective in altering nutrient homeostasis (N, P, K, Ca and Na) of eggplants. The optimistic results gained in the current study could additionally investigate in larger market experiments and also could extensive to other tropical/subtropical fruits and vegetables. "

Grapevine yield is made up of several components, namely the numbers of buds per vine, shoots per bud, clusters per shoot, and berries per cluster, in addition to berry weight. Yield formation occurs over two growing seasons, and developmental and environmental factors interact to determine the final crop through their variable impact on the different yield components. The berries’ physical and chemical composition at harvest determines their quality for fresh consumption or processing. Organic acids, tannin precursors, some minerals such as calcium, and some aroma precursors and green aroma components accumulate during early berry growth, while amino acids, flavonols, and other minerals such as potassium accumulate throughout berry development. Fruit ripening begins at veraison and is associated with berry softening, skin stiffening, accumulation of sugars, anthocyanins, tannins, and flavor and aroma components, increase in pH, and decrease in chlorophyll, organic acids, and green aroma components. Harvest fruit composition varies considerably both within and between vineyards and between years due to differences in fruit maturity and environmental impacts dominated by light, temperature, and water and nutrient status, with some variation also being due to crop load and rootstock.

Pre-storage cold acclimation (PsCA) is a promising postharvest method for reducing \{CI\} and maintaining quality, but the reported duration of PsCA varies greatly, partly because no method so far has been developed for evaluating the chilling tolerance induced by PsCA at an early time. Following PsCA at 10 °C for 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, 48 h and 72 h, CI, secondary diseases and relative electrolyte leakage of cucumbers stored at 5 °C decreased with PsCA duration, indicating PsCA-induced chilling tolerance in cucumber was positively correlated with the length of exposure to PsCA. Meanwhile, PsCA increased soluble solids and ascorbic acid, and reduced malondialdehyde, O2− and H2O2, suggesting that PsCA improved quality by inhibiting reactive oxygen species (ROS) and maintaining cell membrane integrity. In addition, PsCA enhanced gene expression and activities of four enzymatic \{ROS\} scavengers, superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, ascorbate peroxidase, catalase and two non-enzymatic \{ROS\} scavengers, AsA and glutathione. However, different \{ROS\} scavengers had variable transition points before they were consistently activated, suggesting that \{ROS\} scavengers were differentially activated in an orderly way and that the chilling tolerance is positively correlated with the number of activated \{ROS\} scavengers, but require enough number of \{ROS\} scavengers to be effective. This study provides possibility for early evaluation of PsCA-induced chilling tolerance and for timely arrangement of marketing and processing to reduce losses. "

SDS-PAGE analysis revealed non-accumulation of some polypeptides related to the ripening process due to storage at 6 °C, and two-dimensional electrophoresis confirmed the appearance of specific low-temperature polypeptides. While many polypeptides observed in freshly harvested fruit persisted during storage, several acid polypeptides were detected only during the first few days of storage at 6 °C. A substrate-dependent change in protease activity was also found in fruit under chilling temperature storage, as compared to ripening fruit. After a decrease to barely detectable levels during the early phase of cold storage, the proteolytic activity then increased, mainly hydrolizing endogenous proteins to free amino acid components. "

abstract = "The influence of supplemental microsprinkler irrigation on fruit colour of ‘Topred Delicious’ apples (Malus domestica Borkh.) was evaluated in the area of Lleida (NE Spain) over a 3-year period. Cooling irrigation was applied for 2 h daily for 25–30 days preceding the harvest. Three treatments were evaluated: (1) control without overtree microsprinkler irrigation; (2) microsprinkler irrigation applied at sunset; (3) microsprinkler irrigation applied at mid-day (year 2) or at sunrise (year 3). Fruit colour, measured with a Minolta CR-200 portable triestimulus colourimeter using the \{CIE\} [1976] L∗a∗b∗ system, and anthocyanin concentration were significantly affected by the cooling irrigation and also by the weather of the particular year. While in 1997, low temperatures and rainfall prior to harvest masked the effects of cooling irrigation on fruit colour, 1998 and 1999 were average warm years, and cooled fruits had better colour. Increased red colour, and higher anthocyanin content resulted from microsprinkler irrigation especially when applied at sunset and at sunrise. Fruit firmness, fruit size, and soluble solids concentration (SSC) were significantly higher in cooled fruits than the control, whereas titratable acidity (TA) was not influenced consistently by the evaporative cooling.

The biocontrol activity of M. pulcherrima 2.33 or 4.4 can be reduced or totally suppressed by the addition of several nitrates. The addition of 100 g l−1 fructose inhibited the pathogen per se, while leaving unaltered the antagonistic capability of M. pulcherrima. These results support the hypothesis that competition for nutrients plays a major role in the biocontrol capability of M. pulcherrima against Botrytis postharvest rot of apple. However, both yeasts strongly inhibited the growth and spore germination of B. cinerea in vitro even under non-restrictive nutrient conditions. There was no evidence for the involvement of diffusible toxic metabolites in the biocontrol efficacy. The antagonistic activity of M. pulcherrima was dependent on the concentration of the antagonist. At 107–108 cells ml−1, 2.33 was most effective when applied at least 6 h before the pathogen, while 4.4 provided consistent results when co-inoculated with B. cinerea or applied 1 h later. Rapid colonisation of fresh apple fruit wounds was observed at room temperature during the first 24–48 h, and then the populations stabilised for the remaining storage period. On apple wounds kept at 4°C, the increase in population density of M. pulcherrima was lower, but continued over 96–128 h after application of the antagonists until it reached the same saturation level observed on apples stored at room temperature.

Although there have been different evaluations of genotypes growing under the same environmental conditions, revealing great variability for seed and oil quality, no reports are available about the effect environmental conditions during grain filling over such traits. The objectives of this work were to determine (i) the effect of harvest dates on seed quality and oil concentration, (ii) if such changes can be explained by the average temperature during grain filling and (iii) how harvest dates could affect biodiesel quality. An experiment was carried out during 29 months in experimental plots located in Formosa, Argentina. A systematic fruit harvest was conducted during 15 different dates on 10 plants with similar height (≈1.80 m). Environmental conditions during the experiment were appropriate to create a broad individual seed weight range (326–752 mg) and significant differences were found among harvest dates. Seed oil concentrations were significantly different among harvest dates with a maximum value of 38.7 ± 0.6% on 08 August 2011 and a minimum of 19.6 ± 1.8% on 17 March 2010. Oil concentration increased linearly as seed weight increased up to a value of 605 mg, after which higher seed weight was not associated with greater seed oil concentration. Oil concentration was largely (r2 = 0.85) explained by the kernel percentage through a linear regression (y = −25.9 + 0.967x). Variations in seed weight and oil concentration were not associated with changes in average temperature during grain filling, suggesting that fluctuations in the source-sink relation through the growing season could explain the variations found among harvest dates. Temperature during seed filling period strongly affected oil composition and higher temperatures were associated with higher oleic acid and lower linoleic acid concentrations, although this effect generated only small effects on the biodiesel quality. Environmental conditions during grain filling modified seed quality and oil composition, while its concentration was not affected. This work reveals the existence of harvest dates effects on seed quality and oil concentration, although unrelated with the environmental conditions explored during grain filling period. "

In this study, changes in specific metabolites and protein expression profiles of grape berries under cold storage were investigated by liquid chromatography and proteomic studies, respectively. During cold storage, total soluble solids and reducing sugars accumulation was accompanied by a decline in organic acids and phenols contents. A comparative analysis of the proteomes of grape berries during cold storage was performed using a two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) proteomic approach. Seventy-nine differentially regulated proteins during cold storage were successfully identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry, and classified into eight main categories based on their biological function. Down-regulation of proteins associated with glycolysis and the Krebs cycle, and up-regulation of cell wall polysaccharide degradation-related enzymes provided molecular evidence that soluble sugar and carbohydrate metabolism play a crucial role in postharvest regulation. In addition, cold storage increased the expression abundance of several stress related proteins such as heat shock proteins, proteasome and antioxidant enzymes, suggesting a physiological adaptation to low temperature was induced in grape berries. This study contributes to a better understanding of the cellular events in grape berries under cold storage and provides potentially useful information for maintaining fruit quality and minimizing postharvest losses.

The three irrigation frequencies were: pulsed irrigation (10–20 min every 30 min) throughout the day (Irg1), one daily irrigation event beginning at night and terminated in the morning every day (Irg2) and one irrigation event every two days (Irg3). Irrigation management induced significant differences in water availability in the root zone and subsequently, the diurnal and periodic water uptake. Water uptake of trees in the Irg1 treatment closely followed changes in the meteorological conditions (air temperature, pan evaporation and vapour pressure deficit) while that of trees in the Irg2 and Irg3 treatments was depressed by intermediate and severe water stress, respectively. The experimental treatments had little effect on the vegetative growth, flowering or fruit-set processes. However there were significant treatment differences on fruitlet abscission and accordingly, on fruit yield. Black spots initiated from the seed became apparent on some of the fruits at the beginning of June, and about two weeks later an intensive abscission of fruitlet begun that ended at the beginning of July. The abscission was more intense in the 100-L than the 200-L containers, in the following order: Irg3 &gt; Irg2 ≫ Irg1 regardless of the container volume. Net \{CO2\} assimilation during periods of fruit growth decreased in trees exposed to moderate or severe water stress (Irg2 and Irg3, respectively) and therefore, it is plausible that fruitlet abscission resulted from carbohydrate stress. Improvement of water and nutrient availability, especially in periods where the activity of the root system was weak as a result of low carbohydrate supply presumably played a dominant role in seeds or fruit function.

Fruit of red apple (Malus domestica Borkh.) ‘Royal Gala’ and red European pear (P. communis L.) ‘Cascade’ received the same treatments for comparison. Furthermore, the effects of light quality and irradiance level on ‘Mantianhong’ pears were evaluated at the optimum temperature for anthocyanin accumulation. Fruit firmness and concentrations of total soluble sugars and organic acids were measured to determine fruit quality. The effect of temperature on red Chinese sand pear fruit color was similar to that of apples, but not European pear. Moreover, low temperature more effectively induced red coloration in ‘Mantianhong’ and ‘Meirensu’ pears than high temperature; anthocyanin levels increased with increasing irradiance level from 0 to 532 μmol m−2 s−1, and UV-B and visible light synergistically improved the red color of the fruit. Therefore, a combination of low temperature and high intensity of UV-B/visible light could improve the postharvest coloration of red sand pear fruit. The results will contribute to an improved understanding of the mechanism responsible for the coloration of red Chinese sand pears and will aid development of new techniques to improve color in postharvest fruit.

High temperatures during the chilling period have a negative effect on breaking of dormancy. Shading of trees reduces the incidence of radiation and the temperature. Previous works on shading did not take into account the stage of dormancy. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effects of shading during different periods of endodormancy, in an area having relatively warm winters, and the effects of a treatment of thidiazuron ([TDZ] N-phenyl-N-1,2,3-thiodiazol-5-il-urea) and winter oil, on apricot blooming, fruit set and ripening. The study was carried out during three years which showed marked differences regarding chilling accumulation. Autumn shading did not affect blooming or harvesting. Regarding harvest date, 2–3 days of precocity were achieved by shading during endodormancy, relative to the control. The \{TDZ\} + oil treatment increased blooming percentage, made blooming more uniform and brought forward the blooming (by 7–14 days) and ripening (3–8 days) dates. However, pistil abortion percentage was strongly increased by using \{TDZ\} and winter oil when there was low chilling accumulation, which led to reduce fruit set percentage. Shading during late endodormancy produced 5 days precocity for the harvest date in the year with lower chill accumulation. Shading of trees during endodormancy and \{TDZ\} + oil treatment could be suitable for increasing precocity in warm-winter climates. Significant year-to-year variation has been shown for blooming, pistil abortion, fruit set and fruit/bud percentages. Correlations among these variables are also discussed. Under conditions of marginal chill accumulation, the distribution of chilling during autumn and winter had an important role in the overcoming of dormancy, blooming and fruit set. "

Control plants were grown at 30/22 °C (day/night). Exposure to high temperature (heat stress) during different periods of development after anthesis adversely affected fruit growth, seed yield, and seed quality in chili pepper. Heat stress for the whole period after anthesis, and from 30 \{DAA\} until harvest reduced the growth period of chili fruits by 15 and 10 days, respectively. Heat stress from 10 to 30 \{DAA\} reduced fruit width and fruit weight. The early stage of seed development from anthesis until 10 \{DAA\} was sensitive to high temperature, which affected fruit length, fruit weight and seed set. Applying high temperatures to plants for 10 \{DAA\} increased the proportion of abnormal seeds per fruit. High temperatures from 10 \{DAA\} until 30 \{DAA\} inhibited carbohydrate accumulation and adversely affected seed germinability and vigor.

The model thus includes the variations in maturity at harvest of the individual fruit. In non-linear regression analyses of data from four different seasons, the explained part ranged from 81 to 92% for cv ‘Spring Bright’. The kinetic parameters values obtained were highly similar in different seasons. The results suggest that in nectarines the degreening of fruit flesh, expressed as \{TRS\} absorption at 670 nm, is synchronised with the softening. The distribution of μa was skewed, but that of the biological shift factor, derived from μa, was normal. By measuring the colour of fruit flesh with the non-destructive and very rapid \{TRS\} technique, and applying the model parameters, individual fruit can be graded at harvest into classes of usability, selecting fruit with different ripening stages for different market segments and predicting their softening time, thereby guaranteeing sufficient firmness to transport the fruit and sufficient ripening potential to reach good eating quality upon arrival in the receiving regions or countries. Consumers therefore will be more satisfied, encouraging them to repeated purchase. Retailers and wholesalers will be more satisfied since fruit unfit for sale not longer needs to be transported. "

Mild to moderate water stress is desirable in wine grape in determined phenological periods for controlling vine vigor and optimizing fruit yield and quality according to producer preferences and objectives. The traditional leaf temperature based crop water stress index (CWSI) for monitoring plant water status has not been widely used for irrigated crops in general partly because of the need to know well-watered and non-transpiring leaf temperatures under identical environmental conditions. In this study, leaf temperature of vines irrigated at rates of 35, 70 or 100% of estimated evapotranspiration demand (ETc) under warm, semiarid field conditions in southwestern Idaho \{USA\} was monitored from berry development through fruit harvest in 2013 and 2014. Neural network (NN) models were developed based on meteorological measurements to predict well-watered leaf temperature of wine grape cultivars ‘Syrah’ and ‘Malbec’ (Vitis vinifera L.). Input variables for the cultivar specific \{NN\} models with lowest mean squared error were 15-min average values for air temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation and wind speed collected within ±90 min of solar noon (13:00 and 15:00 MDT). Correlation coefficients between \{NN\} predicted and measured well-watered leaf temperature were 0.93 and 0.89 for ‘Syrah’ and ‘Malbec’, respectively. Mean squared error and mean average error for the \{NN\} models were 1.07 and 0.82 °C for ‘Syrah’ and 1.30, and 0.98 °C for ‘Malbec’, respectively. The \{NN\} models predicted well-watered leaf temperature with significantly less variability than traditional multiple linear regression using the same input variables. Non-transpiring leaf temperature was estimated as air temperature plus 15 °C based on maximum temperatures measured for vines irrigated at 35% (ETc). Daily mean \{CWSI\} calculated using \{NN\} estimated well-watered leaf temperatures between 13:00 and 15:00 \{MDT\} and air temperature plus 15 °C for non-transpiring leaf temperature consistently differentiated between deficit irrigation amounts, irrigation events, and rainfall. The methodology used to calculate a daily \{CWSI\} for wine grape in this study provided a daily indicator of vine water status that could be automated for use as a decision-support tool in a precision irrigation system.

Low temperatures induce physiological disorders in peach, but the effect of cold storage on the sensory quality of the fruit before it is damaged by chilling injury syndrome remains unclear. To evaluate the cold storage effect on the sensory quality two peach cultivars (’Royal Glory’ and ‘Elegant Lady’) and two nectarines (’Ruby Diamond’ and ‘Venus’) were harvested at a standardized firmness level and subjected to quality evaluations and sensory analysis at harvest and after storage at 0 °C for 35 d. For both time points, a supplementary ripening followed such that homogeneous flesh firmness and suitability for consumption was achieved. The fruit segregation through the Durofel firmness (DF), evaluated using a non-destructively method (Durofel device), allowed the formation of a uniform group of fruit in terms of flesh firmness (FF), showing scores between 45.1 and 55.9 N. The average \{FF\} in fruit ripened immediately after harvest was 22.9 N and 25.6 N in fruit ripened after cold storage for 35 d. The “acceptability” of fruit is highly correlated with “aroma”, “sweetness”, “juiciness”, “texture” and “flavor”. Only the “acid taste” parameter had no significant correlation with “acceptability” or with the other parameters evaluated. It is possible to conclude that the sensory quality and acceptability of peach and nectarine are characteristic of each cultivar and change, depending on the time elapsed after harvest. In general, it was confirmed that nectarine cultivars have a more consistent quality than peach cultivars. "

This protein was characterized as a glycosylated endo-1,3-β-glucanase with a Mr of 22.07 kDa and a pI of 5.25. The hydrolase was active and stable in a broad acidic pH range and it exhibited maximum activity at pH 5.0. It had a low optimum temperature of 35 °C and it retained 40% maximum activity at 5 °C. The purified 1,3-β-glucanase was relatively heat unstable and its activity declined progressively at temperatures above 50 °C. Kinetic studies revealed low kcat (3.10 ± 0.04 s−1) and Km (0.32 ± 0.03 mg ml−1) values, reflecting the intermediate efficiency of the protein in hydrolyzing laminarin. Moreover, a thermodynamic characterization revealed that the purified enzyme displayed a high kcat at both 37 and 5 °C, and a low Ea (6.99 kJ mol−1) within this range of temperatures. In vitro functional studies indicated that the purified 1,3-β-glucanase had no inhibitory effects on Botrytis cinerea hyphal growth and no antifreeze activity, as determined by thermal hysteresis analysis using differential scanning calorimetry. However, a strong cryoprotective activity was observed against freeze–thaw inactivation of lactate dehydrogenase. Indeed, the \{PD50\} was 8.7 μg ml−1 (394 nM), 9.2-fold higher (3.1 on a molar basis) than that of the cryoprotective protein BSA. Together with the observed accumulation of glycine-betaine in CO2-treated cherimoya tissues, these results suggest that 1,3-β-glucanase could be functionally implicated in low temperature-defense mechanism activated by CO2.

Grapes of defoliated vines generally showed higher sugar content, lower titratable acidity, total flavonoids, flavonoids different from anthocyanins, and total phenolic content than grapes from non-defoliated vines while their total anthocyanin concentration was not affected by defoliation at a significant level. Concerning wines, alcohol content, residual soluble solids, different forms of anthocyanins but also volatile acidity were generally higher in samples from defoliated vines. Differences were also highlighted among the defoliation treatments: the best results in terms of dry matter, sugar and alcohol content were observed in the samples submitted to the more severe defoliation as a consequence of the higher light availability and berry temperature. Concerning the concentration of the individual phenolics, significant differences were highlighted for: caffeic and caftaric acids, peonidin- and malvidin-3-p-coumaroylglucoside, which were higher in the E wines; quercetin-3-glucoside, galactoside, and rhamnoside, and procyanidins, which were higher in F wines.

Dates fruits being harvested once a year; this situation makes the fruit post-harvest treatment necessary so as to minimize losses and avoid the eventual conservation and storage accidents particularly through rainy year or excessively hot climate. This paper presents an experimental investigation of Deglet-Nour treatment by hydration and solar drying process in order to recover and valorise this category. The first aim of this work is to study the effect of different temperature (20 °C, 25 °C 30 °C, 35 °C, 40 °C, 45 °C, 50 °C and 55 °C) of soaking in distilled water on the inversion reaction of sucrose and the second aim is to analyse the drying of hydrated Deglet-Nour dates by three different solar processes. Three drying kinetics have been established respectively in a direct natural convective solar drier, under indirect convective solar drier and in indirect natural solar drier. The experimental results show that the best case was obtained by soaking in water at T = 25 °C to obtain hydrated dates with 0.5 kg water/kg dry matter. Drying time to reach commercial water content (0.35 kg water/kg dry matter) by the use of the three prototypes were respectively 22 h, 11.5 h and 2.5 h. These tests also showed that the drying with indirect natural convective dryer provides a good product quality with acceptable duration, and it is satisfactory and competitive to a forced convective solar drying process. A good microbiological quality was observed on the final product obtained by each of the three different solar driers. "

Fruits were inoculated at different growth stages and then incubated under different initial conditions: 10, 15, 20 and 25 °C each with four wet periods (4, 8, 12 and 24 h). Infection of fruit was not significantly affected by the temperature and duration of wetness. The two cultivars differed significantly in their responses to Botrytis infection depending on the fruiting stage at the time of inoculation. Inoculation of young fruitlets resulted in nearly 50% of fruits aborted on cv. Baldwin, compared to ca. 10% on cv. Ben Hope. Inoculation of fruit near harvest resulted in significantly fewer fruit aborted. The incidence of latent infection decreased with increasing fruit age at the time of inoculation. Sampling of blackcurrant fruit and spraying timing trials in planting of these two cultivars in open-field and under-protected conditions supported the main conclusions drawn from the controlled inoculation studies. Thus irrespective of weather conditions, strategies must be adopted to reduce inoculum and the extent of flower infections. "

For this, Solanum lycopersicum cv. Naomi plants were grown in an experimental greenhouse. Three fruit samples were taken over the entire production period: the first sampling at the beginning of harvest [85 days after transplanting (dat)], the second at mid-harvest (160 dat), and the third at the end of harvest (229 dat). The values for temperature and solar radiation peaked in the third sampling, coinciding with an increase in lipid peroxidation, without lowering yield with respect to previous samplings. Regarding the sugar content in the cherry tomatoes, our results showed that the increase in temperature and solar radiation diminished the sucrose content at 229 dat and raised the hexoses (glucose and fructose) as well as starch content, produced primarily by the enzyme sucrose synthase. On the contrary, the rest of the enzymes responsible for sucrose degradation, acid and neutral invertases, showed no notable changes in their activity at the end of the crop cycle. In short, our results suggest that the increase in sucrolytic activity, induced mainly by sucrose synthase under these conditions, contributes to the mechanisms of antioxidant defense by supplying precursors (glucose and fructose) of antioxidant compounds in order to restrict the massive accumulation of \{ROS\} and thereby avoid the appearance of cell necrosis and reduce yield losses.

Changes in polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity, anthocyanin concentration, colour index, eating quality and concentrations of total soluble solids and titratable acidity were measured. The effects of chitosan coating on disease incidence were also evaluated. Application of chitosan coating delayed the decrease in anthocyanin content, the increase in \{PPO\} activity and the changes in colour index and eating quality, reduced the decrease in concentrations of total soluble solids and titratable acidity, and partially inhibited decay.

The experiment was carried out in two identical, adjacent multispan greenhouses, with polyethylene plastic covering. Hybrid Raf (cv. Delizia), tomato plants, were exposed to two treatments of salinity (5 and 7 dS m−1) and two ambient \{CO2\} concentrations (350 and 800 μmol mol−1) in which \{CO2\} enrichment was applied during the daytime according to a strategy linked to ventilation. The high salinity treatment (7 dS m−1) increased firmness (N), total soluble solids content (SSC), titratable acidity (TA) and the percentage of dry matter of the fruit (% DM), however, the pH was reduced. In return, \{CO2\} enrichment did not affect firmness, \{TA\} and pH, whereas \{SSC\} and % \{DM\} were increased. On the other hand, the climatic variations as temperature, radiation and \{CO2\} concentration, during the period of fruit development (PFD) affected its duration. The effective degree days (EDDs) model that combines temperature and radiation was used to study the relationship with the \{PFD\} and quality parameters. A good correlation was found between \{PFD\} and \{EDDs\} (r2 = 0.95). Thus the thermal time model by incorporating radiation can be recommended for our region to predict the period of fruit development in a hybrid Raf tomato crop. With respect to quality parameters, an increasing trend was observed between fruit firmness in high salinity conditions and the \{EDDs\} though the correlation was weak (r2 = 0.50). We did not find a relationship on SSC, TA, pH and % DM. \{CO2\} enrichment shortened two days of the \{PFD\} and salinity did not affect this parameter. According to the results, \{CO2\} enrichment allows increasing the production of a high value commercial crop grown under saline conditions by reducing the time needed for complete fruit development without compromising organoleptic quality.

Low temperature storage has the additional benefit of protecting non-appearance quality attributes: texture, nutrition, aroma and flavor. Time of day when harvest is performed can influence shelf life. In addition, delays in cooling after harvest can reduce commodity shelf life and quality. In commercial handling, shelf life of commodities may vary greatly from laboratory studies. The distribution chain rarely has the facilities to store each commodity under ideal conditions and requires handlers to make comprises as to the choice of temperature and relative humidity (RH). These choices can lead to physiological stress and loss of shelf life and quality. This limitation, especially late in the handling chain during retailing, requires all participants in the distribution chain to increase their understanding of the need to improve management of handling, temperature and RH, to limit losses in quality. Simulated storage studies should be conducted under conditions that approximate the average to better levels of commercial practices. "

However, the postharvest life based on overall quality was longer at 0°C than at 5°C or 10°C. The production of aroma compounds was markedly influenced by storage time and temperature. Individual aroma compounds were affected differently. For example, ethyl hexanoate, hexyl acetate, methyl acetate, and butyl acetate increased, while 3-hexenyl acetate and methyl hexanoate decreased during storage. In general, strawberries stored at 10°C or 5°C produced higher levels of these volatiles than those stored at 0°C. In conclusion, strawberries stored at 0°C retained an acceptable overall quality for the longest storage duration; however, berries stored at temperatures higher than 0°C showed higher content of aroma compounds and antioxidant capacity during the postharvest period.

The previous results were significantly observed with \{B12\} at 9 mM compared to control and other \{B12\} concentrations. However, total solid content (SSC%), titratable acidity (TA%), and SSC/TA ratio were significantly affected by \{B12\} at 9 mM up to end the shelf-life period. In contrast, the lowest values of total chlorophyll (Chlab) content during shelf-life compared with other \{B12\} concentrations. Therefore, cyanocobalamin (B12) is an effective vitamin for improving or generating berry color at harvest time and maintaining cluster quality of ‘Crimson seedless’ grapes during shelf-life (marketing).

However, few studies have been conducted on the storage and transportation of this fruit. Accordingly, the present study investigated the influences of harvest reasons, fruit maturity, and storage temperature on the food quality and storage life of ‘Honglong’ fruits. The results showed that the color and firmness of summer fruits were superior to those of winter fruits; the winter fruits at 70% or 80% maturity had a significantly longer the storage life than the corresponding summer fruits. Fruits with 70% maturity (i.e., when half of the fruit is yellow) are bright green-yellow, high in total soluble solids (7.1°Brix for winter fruits and 7.5°Brix for summer fruits), and low in titratable acidity (0.34% for winter fruits and 0.32% for summer fruits). In addition, the storage life and cold resistance of fruits with 70% maturity had a longer life and were more resistant to cold than those with 60% maturity were. The transportation storage temperature of 5 °C caused slight chilling injury but was optimal for maintaining food quality, storage life, and shelf life. Storage temperatures of 0 and 3 °C caused severe chilling injury, and 10 °C caused the fruits to rapidly turn yellow and rot. We suggest that ‘Honglong’ fruits be harvested at 70% maturity and be stored at 5 °C to achieve optimal quality for commercial production. "

In general, fruits treated with MeJA and chitosan maintained higher levels of fruit firmness, anthocyanin, and showed significant delays in decay incidence compared to control fruit. MeJA-treated fruits exhibited a greater lignin content and SSC/TA ratio, and delayed decay incidences. Instead, chitosan-treated fruits presented higher antioxidant capacity and total phenol content. In short, both the elicitors were able to increase the shelf life of fruits as evidenced by the increased levels of lignin and anthocyanin, especially of the second harvest. "

Over a period of separate growing seasons ‘La France’ pears were harvested at the stage considered most favorable for the development of high quality fruit and stored in air at 1 °C for intervals from 2 weeks to 6 months. After the low temperature storage treatment the pears were maintained at 20 °C and continuously monitored for flesh elasticity and texture evaluated by sensory evaluation. The laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV) was employed to detect responses to imposed vibration of intact pears and an FFT-analysis was used to estimate the second resonant peak used for the calculation of the elasticity index E. Pears stored for relatively short intervals (from 2 weeks to 2 months) developed textural qualities consistent with consumer's expectations and as these fruit ripened there was a steady decline in the E-value. The decline in the elasticity index E complied with both the reciprocal and conventional exponential models; however, the reciprocal model more consistently reflected the experimental data. Fruit stored for over 4 months failed to ripen or developed an undesirable skin color. Typically these fruit developed a texture that made them unacceptable for consumption and as a result such pears were of no commercial value. \{LDV\} analysis showed that these fruit developed an irregular pattern in the elasticity index over the course of the post-storage ripening interval. A normalized curve was proposed to compare the E declination for pears with different initial elasticity indices when subjected to various storage periods. Since changes in the fruit flesh elasticity index reflects characteristics of cell wall structure and cell turgor, the use of \{LDV\} measurements of intact fruit may be a useful approach for exploring, non-destructively, the progression of metabolic changes in fruit cell walls associated with ripening.

The papayas in two fluctuating temperature regimes deviated from a semi-constant regime by being held for 1 h at 15 °C plus 1 h at 23.5 °C versus 2 h at 12 °C to simulate the period on the tarmac prior to loading onto an airplane, 7 h at 23.5 °C versus 7 h at 12 °C to simulate the flight period, and then for either 2 h at 1 °C or 2 h at 23.5 °C versus 2 h at 12 °C to simulate waiting on the tarmac after unloading the airplane. The fluctuating temperature regimes simulated actual conditions previously documented by us as encountered during ground and in-flight perishable handling operations. Overall, papayas handled in the fluctuating cold or warm temperature regimes lost more weight, developed objectionable color, were softer and more shriveled, had more decay, and had lower soluble solids, acidity and ascorbic acid contents than papayas handled in the semi-constant temperature regime. In addition, papaya handled in the fluctuating cold temperature regime that included exposure to 1 °C for 2 h developed chilling injury symptoms after being transferred to 20 °C for 7 days. Abraded and abraded + inoculated papaya fruit handled in semi-constant temperature developed less decay during shelf life than those stored in fluctuating temperatures. Loss of firmness and development of chilling injury symptoms were the primary quality factors that limited the shelf life of papaya fruit. Papaya from the first harvest and handled in a semi-constant temperature regime never became unacceptable for sale even after 7 days of shelf life. For papayas transported in fluctuating cold or warm temperature regimes, the greatest quality loss was noticeable during simulated air flight, during truck transportation from the airport to the warehouse and then to the supermarket, and during shelf life compared with warehouse storage at the grower, truck transportation to the airport, waiting on the tarmac, or backroom storage at the supermarket. The results indicate that fluctuating and/or high or low temperatures that are often encountered for as little as a few hours during handling operations, may result in a considerable amount of papaya rejected.

Arazá fruit of both stages of maturity showed a climacteric pattern of ripening, with the maximum levels of respiration being reached after 5 days at 20 °C for breaker fruit, while half-yellow fruit ripened totally after one day. Weight loss was the most limiting quality trait for arazá fruit. Chilling injury symptoms included skin scald (only at 7 °C), uneven ripening (at 7 or 10 °C, including uneven softening during storage, particularly in breaker fruit), and slight acidification at 7 °C. Decay in the post-storage shelf-life periods (mainly Gloesporium sp.) was particularly high after storage at 7 °C in breaker fruit. The storage of breaker arazá fruit at 12 °C is recommended because this prevents chilling injury and flesh acidification, and allows normal fruit ripening during a post-storage shelf-life at 20 °C, as revealed by the lower organic acids (mainly malic) content and increased sugar (glucose, fructose and sucrose) content.

abstract = "Abstract Productivity of temperate deciduous crops is potentially more vulnerable to climate change than many annual crops because temperate deciduous crops flower and set crops at the beginning of the growing season when temperatures vary greatly. The fruit development periods (time between bloom and harvest) of many fruit tree species (peach and nectarine (Prunus persica), plum (Prunus salicina), prune (Prunus domestica), sweet cherry (Prunus avium), almond (Prunus dulcis), pear (Pyrus communis)) are inversely related to accumulated heat during the first month after bloom – the higher the accumulated heat, the shorter the fruit development period (Fig. 1). The fruit development period of a cultivar can vary among years by as much as 30 days and most of the effects on development occur during the early stages of fruit development. Thus, spring temperatures can have significant effects on fruit sizes and/or tree yields because, during warm springs, rates of fruit growth cannot keep up with rates of fruit development when spring temperatures are excessively high. In recent years spring temperature variability appears to be increasing. While historic mean growing degree hour (GDH) accumulations in the month after peach tree bloom in California were around 6000 GDH, recently 3 years have registered accumulations over 8000 \{GDH\} and one year was above 9000 GDH. This caused early harvests and problems with fruit size. A harvest prediction model has been developed to help growers cope with these variable weather events (http://fruitsandnuts.ucdavis.edu/Weather_Services/Harvest_Prediction__About_Growing_Degree_Hours/). In addition, prolonged temperatures &gt; 27o C occurring during bloom have also negatively affected fruit set of prunes (Prunus domestica) and sweet cherries (Prunus avium). California prune production is especially vulnerable because it is dependent a single cultivar. Breeding efforts are under way to spread the bloom period and decrease the risk of sporadic warm spells during spring (Table 1). "

This decreased over the series of harvest timings to a minimum of approximately 22 d when pears were harvested 28 d after initial maturity. At 5 °C, fruit harvested at initial maturity required approximately 30 d to achieve ripening capacity, while those harvested 28 d after initial maturity needed only 2 d. At 10 °C, fruit harvested at initial maturity required approximately 18 d to achieve ripening capacity; pears harvested 21 and 28 d after initial maturity ripened in less than 10 d at 10 °C, and most of the fruit from these harvest timings were deteriorated at all durations ≥10 d at 10 °C. The relationship between harvest timing and the conditioning duration necessary to induce ripening at each temperature was well-described by second-order polynomial regression. Using this relationship, the duration of conditioning necessary to induce ripening capacity in ‘d’Anjou’ pears at −0.5, 5, or 10 °C corresponding to specific harvest timings can be calculated from the regression equations.

The experiments were performed for 5 independent harvest times during two years (2014–2015). The conditions of storage were temperatures of 4, 8 and 12 °C and a relative humidity of 80%. Fruit with (Y) and without calyx (N) were packed into polyethylene terephthalate (PET) trays and polypropylene (PP) baskets, respectively. The experiment was conducted for a total of 76 d or shorter when the fruit was spoilt earlier. Fruit with the calyx showed a longer shelf life, while 8 °C was the temperature that gave longer shelf lives irrespective of the calyx presence. The critical quality attribute of shelf life without calyx was fungal growth, which determined consumer acceptance; weight loss was the most critical quality attribute for the fruit with calyx. Studying various quality attributes in an integral way appeared to give a better understanding of the shelf life. "

This work investigated the potential for disinfestation by heat treatment (HT) of cv. Binh Thuan in order to meet the biosecurity requirements of importing countries. Main-season fruit from Viet Nam were subjected to hot air treatments and stored for 2–4 weeks storage at 5 °C in sealed polypropylene bags, and fruit quality examined during subsequent shelf-life at 20 °C. \{HTs\} applied were fruit core temperatures (FCT) of 46.5 °C for durations of 20 and 40 min, and 48.5 °C for 50, 70 and 90 min. Assessments included turgor of the bracts and stem, the appearance of the body of the fruit and presence of rots, skin colour, flesh firmness, soluble solids concentration, fruit acidity, taste, and flesh translucence. ‘Binh Thuan’ Dragon fruit proved to be tolerant of hot air treatment and at the lower \{HT\} temperature (FCT 46.5 °C for 20 min) fruit quality was not significantly different from non-heated control fruit, either after treatment at harvest, or after storage for up to 4 weeks. However, metrics quantifying the appearance of both control- and HT-fruit generally deteriorated with storage time at 5 °C, although the internal appearance of the flesh, and taste, remained acceptable throughout. Shelf-life effects were restricted to comparison of the lower \{HT\} temperature (FCT 46.5 °C for 20 min) and non-heated control fruit. Shelf-life after any of the storage periods was terminated after only 4 d, as fruit available for study had not been sprayed with fungicides during the season, and developed anthracnose rots readily at 20 °C. No differences in shelf-life characteristics were established between \{HT\} fruit and control fruit. Our results provide strong evidence that ‘Binh Thuan’ Dragon fruit are a suitable candidate for fruit fly disinfestation by hot air HTs, and that fruit quality during or after storage does not suffer as a consequence.

Restitution coefficient in a collision between two spheres. Jpn. J. Appl. Phys. 26, 1230–1233] contact force model for ‘Jonagold’ apples and bruise prediction models were applied. As a general conclusion, major influences of mechanical parameters on the vibration damage were identified, in particular stack height and fruit size, and minor influences of fruit properties. Also a detailed study was performed to investigate the relation between apple positions in the stacking and bruise damage. It was demonstrated that the position–bruise damage relation depends on the acceleration amplitude, vibration frequency and stack height. The existence of damage chains within the centre of the apple stack was also identified, that is in accordance with the well-known force chains in bulk materials. "

Their exotic appearances attract consumers around the world. Many fruits exhibit respiratory and ethylene production patterns associated with fruit maturation. Physiological changes of climacteric fruits depend on independent ripening of the pulp and rind. Practices during production, handling, and storage lead to postharvest disorders of the fruits. Most tropical fruits are sensitive to low-temperature storage with an optimum storage temperature of 13±1°C. Physiological disorders resulting from metabolic responses of the fruit to the storage environment decrease their marketable values. A practical protocol for delivering tropical fruits of good quality to the consumer is to harvest both climacteric and non-climacteric fruits at the proper maturity and apply the proper postharvest handling techniques such as artificial ripening to balance quality concerns with distribution requirements.

Mechanical harvesting induced significant decreases in oxidative stability and in the main phenolic compounds contents in the oils during cold storage and, only initially, in the total volatiles, regardless of the cultivar considered. However, the contents of volatile esters, associated to fruity flavor, were always higher in the oils from mechanically harvested fruits. ‘Manzanilla de Sevilla’ oils exhibited higher total volatiles during fruit cold storage, regardless of the harvesting system used.

Quality loss after harvest occurs as a result of physiological and biological processes, the rates of which are influenced primarily by product temperature. As the maintenance of market quality is of vital importance to the success of the horticultural industry, it is necessary not only to cool the product but to cool it as quickly as possible after harvest. The process of precooling is the removal of field heat which arrest the deteriorative and senescence processes so as to maintain a high level of quality that ensures customer satisfaction. This paper provides a critical review to portray precooling as an intricate part of temperature management and to highlight the importance of its utilisation for extending the shelf life and maintaining the quality of horticultural products with emphasis on cut flowers. Various different precooling methods are depicted with the benefits and ambiguities of each shown. The applicability and cooling efficiency of each are also illustrated.

Softening was triphasic, consisting of an initial slow softening phase, followed by a rapid phase, and a final slow softening phase. Loss of firmness at each temperature was described by an asymmetric, sigmoidal equation. Rate of firmness change (k) at different temperatures was described by a modified Arrhenius equation for \{RG\} and COP, where k increased with temperature from 0 through ∼22 °C, and decreased through 35 °C. This equation did not describe k at different temperatures for \{GS\} and PR, as k was similar from 0 to 12 °C, and could not be calculated for fruit at 20–35 °C as rapid phase softening was not initiated. Transition between the initial slow softening phase and the rapid softening phase was related to a rapid increase in internal ethylene concentration (IEC) for all cultivars. \{GS\} and \{PR\} had slow softening at 20–35 °C, and had delayed and slow increases in IEC. Equations used in this study could be used to estimate firmness loss at different parts of the commercial post-harvest handling chain, especially where fruit are at non-optimal storage temperatures.

The bruise which can turn the color of salak into brown and decrease its firmness, spreads out quickly. It makes salak loose its firmness and produces bad odor as well as decreasing the consumable part. Moreover, the bruise is not visible without peeling off the fruit skin because of its dark color. Image processing has been applied to monitor the development of bruise for salak stored in various temperatures. The results indicated that the rate of bruise development in salak was 0.196/day at room temperature and 0.040/day at 10°c. Salak can maintain its acceptance quality, with the bruised area is less than 10% of total fruit surface, in 2 days at room temperature and 4 days at 10°C. "

The potential for low temperature conditioning to reduce external damage of ‘Hass’ avocados was examined. Avocados harvested in early summer were conditioned at temperatures of 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 15 °C for a period of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 days before 3 weeks storage at 0 °C. Three days after removal from coolstore, external damage was rated, and internal quality assessed after ripening at 15 °C. The experiment was repeated in late summer, but fruit were stored for 4 weeks at 0 °C, and only external damage was measured. Control fruit stored at 0 °C for either 3 or 4 weeks exhibited severe external damage, manifested as blackening and pitting over almost the whole fruit surface. Conditioning temperatures of 4–10 °C reduced skin damage. The optimum temperature/time combinations were 6 or 8 °C for 3–5 days prior to 0 °C storage. Ripe-fruit quality was also highest in these treatments. Weight loss, ethylene and \{CO2\} production were not associated with the reduction in external damage, and the response observed is therefore likely to be due to a low temperature, rather than a ripening response.

Grapes were stored at three levels of relative humidity (80%, 90% and 100%) and at two temperatures (20 and 30 °C). After seven days, the infection percentage of A. carbonarius was recorded and \{OTA\} accumulation in berries was analysed. Damaged grapes were more commonly infected and development of colonies was higher than in undamaged ones; consequently more \{OTA\} was detected in the former treatment. Temperature and relative humidity had significant influences on both infection and toxin content. The amount of \{OTA\} detected at 30 °C was higher than at 20 °C in most of the treatments. The highest relative humidity (100%) led to maximum amounts of \{OTA\} while no significant differences were found between 90% and 80% in the \{OTA\} content. The implementation of preventive measures in order to minimise berry damage in the field by controlling pathogenic fungi and insects during grape growing and removing visibly damaged grapes at harvest may significantly reduce \{OTA\} contamination in grapes.

Fruit firmness rapidly decreased and the soluble solid content (SSC) increased for all cultivars during the first 14 days of storage at 1 °C. The \{AAC\} and \{TPC\} in vine ripe fruits were similar to the ones of the fruits of storage harvest maturity (8–10% SSC). \{AA\} content depended on the clone and either decreased during storage or remained almost unchanged. There was an increase in \{TPC\} after 7 days of keeping the fruits in a cold store chamber at the temperature 1 °C, but a longer period of storage caused a decrease in these compounds. \{AA\} (at harvest for storage purposes) was higher than that of vine ripe fruits and the ability to absorb free radicals slightly decreased during storage. There was a strong correlation between AAC, \{TPC\} and AA. That means that phenolics and vitamin C affect the antioxidant activity of hardy kiwifruits. "

The commencement of the rise in both \{CO2\} and ethylene production was equal independent of fruit position but the peak of ethylene was behind that of \{CO2\} with a lag of several days. While the climacteric ethylene peak was considerably higher in shaded inside apples, the internal ethylene concentration was at the same level independent of canopy position. During maturation on the tree outside fruit developed a red peel colour while inside fruit remained green. Outside fruit had a higher content of dry matter, soluble solids and soluble sugars but a somewhat lower amount of titratable acidity than inside fruit. High summer temperatures in the second year resulted in a significantly higher content of soluble solids and organic acids independent of fruit position but diminished the soluble solids difference between outside and inside fruit and increased the difference in malic and citric acid concentrations. High summer temperatures also increased the difference in peel colour between outside and inside fruit. Independent of canopy position, the soluble solids concentrations remained unchanged during ripening while the amounts of sucrose as well as malic acid and the titratable acidity decreased with a concomitant rise in the cell sap pH. The higher content of soluble sugars and a somewhat lower amount of titratable acidity in outside red-coloured apples probably contribute to improved fruit quality but the difference seems to be strongly dependent on the growing conditions, especially the sum of heat units.

Under full irrigation, seasonal water use by squash was 479 over 86 days in summer and 306 mm over 91 days in fall season, respectively. Plant water status (as evaluated by relative water content, canopy temperature), fruit quality yield and water use efficiency (WUE) were significantly (P ≤ 0.05) affected by season and both irrigation quantity and mulching materials. Photosynthesis efficiency, total soluble sugars (TSS), leaf area index, harvest index (HI), yield and \{WUE\} were not significantly affected by interaction between growth season and both irrigation and mulching treatments. All mulching materials effectively reduced salt accumulation in the root zone. Mulching treatments markedly increased \{WUE\} and yield in the order of \{FYM\} &gt; \{RSM\} &gt; \{PM\} &gt; WM. Results showed that, under different mulches, the I85% strategy studied here could be successfully applied during summer and fall seasons in commercial squash production allowing water savings of 15% without any detrimental effect on plant growth or yield.

At 0 °C ethylene, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) and 1-(malonylamino)cyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (MACC) contents increased during the first 6 days, though, from days 9–13, their contents decreased to about the initial levels. \{ACC\} oxidase activity decreased considerably during storage at 0 °C, reaching non-detectable values by day 13.

The relationship between climate and three key phenolic compounds in grape skins important to premium wine quality (anthocyanins, tannins, and total phenolics) has not been well-studied. Here we conducted a three-year field study to collect and analyze berry samples from Pinot noir vineyards in the Carneros and Sonoma Valley American Viticultural Areas of California's North Coast wine country, and correlate phenolic measurements with climate statistics derived from hourly temperature measures at each vineyard site. We used several statistical approaches to identify key phenologically-based periods influencing phenolic concentration at maturity, including classification and regression trees, factor screening, principal component analysis, and pairwise correlations. The results from these statistical models showed that cool conditions following harvest the year before maturity, warm temperatures from budburst to bloom, and cool temperatures from bloom to veraison (the onset of ripening) were positively correlated with concentrations of all three classes of phenolics, although not all trends were statistically significant. Anthocyanins were positively and significantly correlated with temperatures between 16 and 22 °C from veraison to harvest. Tannins were significantly increased by warm nights preceding budburst and warm days from budburst to bloom. We measured relatively high levels of light interception (35% of incident photosynthetically active radiation), and we found that increased light interception was significantly correlated with lower levels of all three classes of phenolic compounds in this study. For the Pinot noir sites in this study, warm temperatures from budburst to bloom appear to increase phenolic concentrations, which is likely beneficial for wine quality. However, warmer periods during the preceding fall and summer during ripening appear to offset these effects. Given projections for greater summer warming in California with climate change, the overall impact of climate change on winegrowing is likely to be negative. "

Apples from three cultivars (‘Jonagold’, ‘Braeburn’, and ‘Kanzi’) were harvested at different levels of maturity, and stored at different temperatures and controlled atmosphere (CA) conditions. By using a kinetic model describing firmness breakdown as a function of time, temperature, controlled atmosphere conditions and endogenous ethylene concentration, the main stochastic variables were identified as the initial firmness and the rate constants for firmness breakdown and ethylene production. Treating these variables as random model parameters, the Monte Carlo method was used to simulate the propagation of the fruit-to-fruit variability in flesh firmness within a batch of apples during storage under different \{CA\} conditions and subsequent shelf-life exposure. The model was validated using independent data sets from apples picked in a different season. The model developed in this study can be used to predict the probability of having apples of certain firmness after long term storage for different scenarios of temperatures and \{CA\} conditions. "

The present research work comprised 3 experiments in 2005–6 carried out in a pilot fumigation chamber designed by EcO2 (EcO2 B.V., \{AG\} Numansdorp, The Netherlands). The objective was to test the effectiveness of controlled atmosphere (CA) (decreased \{O2\} at 1 ± 0.5%) at elevated temperature (41 °C) in controlling the major storage pests, fig moth (Ephestia cautella), Indian meal moth (Plodia interpunctella), and dried fruit beetle (Carpophilus spp.). In addition, major quality parameters of the hosts, dried figs, were analyzed soon after the treatments, and after 4 months of storage under ambient conditions, in comparison with MB-treated controls (60 g/m3 for 24 h). The \{CA\} treatment can be recommended as a post-harvest \{MB\} alternative for dried figs since it provided 100% control of the pest species tested, had neutral or positive effects on dried fruit quality and required comparatively short (c.26 h) treatment times compared with other \{MB\} alternatives.

The sites are Sede Nizzan and Ma’abarot, located on the coast, with recycled water (EC=1.3–1.4 dS m−1) and moderate summer temperatures (mean maximum at midsummer of 34 and 32 °C, respectively); Qetura in the Arava Valley, with saline water (EC=3.2–3.4 dS m−1) and high summer temperatures (mean maximum at midsummer of 38 °C); Gilgal in the Jordan Valley, with fresh water (EC=0.8–0.9 dS m−1) and temperatures as at Qetura. Vegetative growth at Qetura was slower than at the other sites, a result attributed to the water deficit induced by the salinity of the irrigation water there. At the coastal sites flowering occurred in both summer and autumn, with three or four flushes (prolific in the autumn), while at the valley sites it was restricted to autumn, with a single sparse flush (less than five flowers per 1 m row). Five years after planting (all the orchards had reached their full size), annual fruit yields were 34 t ha−1 at Ma’abarot, 28 t ha−1 at Sede Nizzan, and 5 t ha−1 at Qetura (fruits were not harvested at Gilgal). As percent fruit-set and fruit weight were similar in all the plots examined, it follows that yields were a function of the number of flowers produced at each site. Analysis of the results indicates that the high summer temperatures prevailing in the valleys inhibited flower production in the two study species. "

However, the liner packaging enhanced the risk of postharvest disease development, if not accompanied by appropriate decay-controlling measures. Applying TBZ, hot water dip or curing controlled the development of postharvest pathogens, especially that of Penicillium molds. In another trial, both hot drench brushing at 56 or 60°C and hot water dip reduced decay incidence. Hot drench brushing at 60°C and hot water dip slowed fruit softening and reduced buttons abscission.

However, the fruit cannot be harvested until its internal quality meets the minimum criteria required for export and marketing, i.e., total soluble solids (TSS) levels above 9.0%, acidity levels below 1.3% and ripening ratio (TSS/acidity ratio) ≥ 7. In a previous study [Burdon et al., 2007. Postharvest conditioning of Satsuma mandarins for reduction of acidity and skin puffiness. Postharvest. Biol. Technol. 43, 102–114], high-temperature conditioning (HTC) at 30 °C for 3–5 d significantly reduced juice acidity levels. In the present study, we confirmed that \{HTC\} for 5 d at 30 °C reduced juice acidity levels in early-season ‘Miho’ Satsuma mandarins by 0.3–0.5%, which resulted in an increase in ripening ratio from 5.5–6.0 at harvest to 7.5–8.0. Furthermore, we evaluated the possible combination of \{HTC\} and ethylene degreening treatments, in order to enable simultaneous acceleration of peel color development and reduction in juice acidity levels. Initial laboratory experiments revealed that peel color change was controlled solely by exposure to ethylene, whereas exposure to high temperatures primarily controlled the decrease in juice acidity levels. Packinghouse experiments in commercial degreening rooms confirmed the effectiveness of the combination of \{HTC\} and degreening treatments in accelerating peel color development, reducing juice acidity, and improving fruit sensory quality. The combined treatment did not cause any negative effects regarding incidence of decay and peel disorders, but did increase fruit weight loss. Overall, we showed that combining \{HTC\} at 30 °C for 5 d with ethylene degreening provides several major benefits for early-season mandarins: (1) it enables earlier harvesting, thus extending the marketing season; (2) it ensures that the fruit will meet the strict minimum-standard criteria and thus reduce the risk of quality rejection; (3) it improves fruit sensory quality and, therefore, consumer acceptance of early-season fruit. Nevertheless, special care must be taken to avoid excessive weight loss caused by exposure to high temperatures. "

Compared with the clean tillage (CT) water management method, \{PFM\} increased, and \{SM\} significantly decreased, the soil temperature (P &lt; 0.05). Both mulching systems increased the gravimetric soil water content (1.9–2.9%) with a reduction in the average annual evapotranspiration (ET) of 82.5 mm and 49.3 mm through \{SM\} and PFM, respectively. The water-use efficiency (WUE) was improved from 5.7 (CT) to 8.1 (PFM) and 9.0 kg m−3 (SM), resulting in a reduction in \{ET\} and an increase in fruit yield from 25.2 (CT) to 32.2 (PFM) and 32.5 t ha−1 (SM). Thus, both mulching systems could serve as models for peach production in semiarid rainfed areas, due to the high soil water content during bloom and fruit expansion. "

P. italicum and G. candidum were able to reduce the growth rate of P. digitatum when it was growing paired ‘in vitro’, suggesting that inhibitory metabolites were produced. In the ‘in vivo’ assays, growth rates of green mould were higher than those of blue mould at any temperature studied.

Day-neutral cultivars such as ‘Seascape’ are adaptable to a range of photoperiods, including short days that would save considerable energy for crop lighting without reductions in productivity or yield. Since photoperiod and temperature interact to affect strawberry growth and development, several diurnal temperature regimes were tested under a short photoperiod of 10 h per day for effects on yield and quality attributes of ‘Seascape’ strawberry during production cycles longer than 270 days. The coolest day/night temperature regime, 16°/8 °C, tended to produce smaller numbers of larger fruit than did the intermediate temperature range of 18°/10 °C or the warmest regime, 20°/12 °C, both of which produced similar larger numbers of smaller fruit. The intermediate temperature regime produced the highest total fresh mass of berries over an entire production cycle. Independent experiments examined either organoleptic or physicochemical quality attributes. Organoleptic evaluation indicated that fruit grown under the coolest temperature regime tended to score the highest for both hedonic preference and descriptive evaluation of sensory attributes related to sweetness, texture, aftertaste, and overall approval. The physicochemical quality attributes Brix, pH, and sugar/acid ratio were highest for fruits harvested from the coolest temperature regime and lower for those from the warmer temperature regimes. The cool-regime fruits also were lowest in titratable acidity. The yield parameters fruit number and size oscillated over the course of a production cycle, with a gradual decline in fruit size under all three temperature regimes. Brix and titratable acidity both decreased over time for all three temperature treatments, but sugar/acid ratio remained highest for the cool temperature regime over the entire production period. Periodic rejuvenation or replacement of strawberry propagules may be needed to maintain both quality and quantity of strawberry yield in space. "

Temperature fluctuations may occur in practice because of varying weather conditions or improper conditioning of the fruit immediately after harvest. Two techniques were found well suited to control the accuracy of the calibration models for soluble solids with respect to temperature fluctuations. The first, and most practical one, consisted of developing a global robust calibration model to cover the temperature range expected in the future. The second method involved the development of a range of temperature dedicated calibration models. The drawback of the latter approach is that the required data collection is very large. When no precautions are taken, the error on the soluble solids content reading may be as large as 4%brix. "

It is generally acknowledged that modified atmospheres with elevated \{CO2\} inhibits fruit ripening by reduces ethylene biosynthesis. This study was to investigate the affect of high concentration \{CO2\} treatment on ethylene biosynthesis, \{ACO\} and softening-related enzymatic activity. Peaches were treated with high \{CO2\} (90 pKa) at the time of sealing in the plastic chambers and then the chambers were ventilated after 3 and 12 h. Fruits treated with 90 kPa \{CO2\} for 3 or 12 h exhibited a significant delay in firmness when compared to control fruits. In addition to fruit softening inhibition, the decay rate was also inhibited by \{CO2\} treatment. Four days after storage at room temperature, \{CO2\} untreated peaches had decay rate of 14%, whereas the decay rate was 6% and 3.5% in fruits treated with 90 kPa \{CO2\} for 3 and 12 h. The \{ACO\} was inhibited by \{CO2\} and the inhibition was enhanced with higher \{CO2\} exposure time. Also High \{CO2\} treatment inhibited the activities of softening-related enzyme such as PG, β-Galactosidase, \{PEL\} promoted by ethylene biosynthesis in peaches. These results indicate that increasing levels of \{CO2\} inhibit ethylene biosynthesis by reducing the \{ACO\} activity of peach fruits. Results suggest that the effect of \{CO2\} on ethylene production in ‘Mihong’ peach fruit depended on exposure time and \{CO2\} level. Also a short-term treatment with a high concentration of \{CO2\} may be used to reduce ethylene biosynthesis, which may be induced after postharvest of fruit. "

The relationship between the duration of conditioning at −1 °C and the fruit flesh firmness after 7 d at 20 °C was well-described by second-order polynomial equations. These equations were used to determine the number of days at −1 °C required to induce ripening capacity for each harvest date. A linear relationship was observed between the number of days after fruit in the orchard reached maturity that fruit were harvested and the number of days of low-temperature conditioning needed to induce ripening capacity. This relationship may be used to predictively estimate the duration of low-temperature conditioning required to induce ripening based on harvest date. "

The first signs of cellular damage are associated with internal membrane disorganization of the plastids. Great vesiculation of the cytoplasm occurs, followed by degradation of cytoplasmic membranes and accumulation of abundant osmiophilic material, yielding amorphous and dense masses. The disorder started by September. Spotting was only observed on the outer side of the fruit and on portions of the rind most exposed to external factors. Radiation and high temperature of the rind over long periods may induce localized dehydration, plasmolysis and cell collapse. "

However, there are no published studies of manipulative experiments that demonstrate a direct role for temperature as a regulator of oil yield and oil quality in olive. The objectives of this study were to: i) elucidate the effect of temperature during the fruit oil accumulation phase on fruit dry weight, oil concentration and fatty acid composition; and ii) identify the developmental window within the oil accumulation phase exhibiting the greatest sensitivity to temperature and that with the highest fruit capacity to recover from the temperature treatments. Two branch-level experiments were conducted in a commercial orchard at Los Molinos (La Rioja, Argentina) using var. ‘Arauco’. Both experiments were conducted during the oil accumulation phase by enclosing fruiting branches in transparent plastic chambers with individualized temperature control. The first experiment; known as the four month long experiment, employed four temperature treatments that were applied for a single period of four months: a control at ambient temperature, two heating levels (5 °C and 10 °C warmer than the control), and a cooling level (5 °C cooler than the control). The second experiment consisted of four separate successive one month long treatment periods, in each of which two temperature treatments were applied: control and heating (ca. 7 °C higher than control). In the four month long experiment, fruit dry weight was not affected by average temperatures in the 16–25 °C range, but it was reduced with further increases in temperature. Oil concentration decreased linearly at 1.1% °C−1 across the whole range (16–32 °C) of average seasonal temperatures explored, while oleic acid concentration decreased 0.7% °C−1 over the same range. In the one month long experiment, 30 days of temperatures ca. 7 °C above ambient had a permanent negative effect on oil concentration at final harvest, particularly when the exposure to high temperature took place at the beginning of oil accumulation. By contrast, oleic acid concentration at the end of the treatment interval fell with increasing temperature but it could recover after treatment was removed in all periods except the first one. These results show that high temperatures during the oil accumulation phase may negatively affect olive oil yield and quality in warm regions, particularly if the high-temperature event occurs early in the phase. Additionally, the response of oleic acid concentration (%) to temperature under our experimental conditions was found to be opposite to that of many annual oil-seed crops. "

Immediately after HWDs, \{PA\} content increased in flavedo with temperature and exposure time. The most important relative increase occurred in spermine (spm), despite being the minor PA. The HWD-induced spm content decreased about two-fold after 28 days of cold storage. Spermine reduction was more important than that observed in spermidine (spd) and putrescine (put). This pattern of change in \{PA\} content does not appear to be related to the HWD-induced cold tolerance. "

In separate experiments, cherries were also infested with codling moth larvae and subjected to similar hot water bath heating. The quality attributes showed different sensitivity to the combinations of temperature and time used for hot water bath treatment. Pitting was more common in fruit treated at lower temperatures for longer times, while stem browning was more common in fruit treated at high temperatures. Berry browning, stem color, and pitting were the quality attributes most affected by heat treatment. Browning of cherry stem color was a crucial factor in determining whether a combination of temperature and time for hot water bath treatment was successful. All cherries stored at 0 °C for 14 days to simulate sea shipment were of unacceptable quality after shelf life. Hot water bath treatments that provided 100% codling moth mortality and maintained overall acceptable fruit quality were very limited and included treatments at 50 °C for 10 min and at 54 °C for 6 min. Delaying the hot water bath treatment after fruit harvest, even if the cherries were kept at 0 °C, resulted in a greater loss in fruit quality compared with those treated on the harvest day. Using hot water baths as a quarantine treatment for codling moths (Cydia pomonella) on sweet cherries may be feasible if fruit are air shipped at 5 °C for 2 days, but not suitable if fruit are sea shipped at 0 °C for 14 days.

We demonstrated that harvest time had a remarkable effect on fruit chilling tolerance: early-harvested fruits were very susceptible to \{CI\} and were severely damaged after 4 weeks of exposure to 1 °C followed by an additional week at a shelf-life temperature of 20 °C, whereas late-harvested fruits were rather chilling tolerant and showed hardly any \{CI\} symptoms after similar exposure. In addition, we developed a postharvest low-temperature-conditioning (LTC) treatment for ‘Wonderful’ pomegranate fruits; it involves exposure to a moderate temperature of 15 °C for 10 days before transfer to the cold-quarantine treatment. When this proposed \{LTC\} treatment was applied to mid-season fruits, it entirely prevented the appearance of \{CI\} symptoms after 4 weeks storage at 1 °C followed by one additional week at 20 °C, without impairment of fruit-quality parameters, as manifested in loss of weight, flavor, juice total soluble solids and acid contents, and total antioxidant activity. Overall, these findings demonstrate that harvesting mid- and, preferably, late-season fruits, and applying a pre-storage \{LTC\} treatment at 15 °C for 10 days, enables export of ‘Wonderful’ pomegranates to new markets that require cold-quarantine disinfestation treatments against the Mediterranean fruit fly.

Evolution of microbial flora was followed to analyse their possible contribution, as an exogenous source, to enzymatic polygalacturonase (PG) activity. Our results indicated that the mild temperature–time regime mediated the selection and proliferation of a microbial flora that contributed to enzymatic \{PG\} activity modifying the pectic fraction. The enzymatic activity generated rises in the calcium pectate (CaP) fraction, which favoured the drying of fruit with an initial low content of soluble pectins (SP) and CaP. Thus, the changes in texture helped during the transfer of moisture, facilitating the dehydration process, and therefore, a milder temperature–time regime was required. Consequently, bioactive compounds of the fruit, such as capsorubin, capsanthin and provitamin A carotenoids, remained almost unaltered. On the other hand, when the \{SP\} fraction increased during dehydration, the process was delayed, and this was also correlated with a higher content in \{SP\} and CaP in fresh fruit, indicating that the fruits were harvested at a later stage of ripeness. In this case a more intense temperature–time regime was needed, negatively affecting the carotenoid content by decreasing it significantly. "

Thus, postharvest application of chitosan as an edible coating can effectively maintain the quality and extend the storage life of plum up to 35 days under low temperature storage condition. "

abstract = "Abstract Internal browning (IB) can be a serious problem with the use of modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) for ‘Bartlett’ pears (Pyrus communis L.) grown in the Pacific Northwest during storage and transit to distant markets. To investigate this disorder, ‘Bartlett’ pears harvested at commercial maturity were packed in a commercial \{MAP\} (MAPc), an experimental \{MAP\} (MAPe) and commercial perforated plastic bags (control) and stored in air at −1.1 °C. After 1 and 3 months of storage, samples of \{MAPc\} and control fruit were transferred to rooms at temperatures of 2, 4.5, 7.5, and 10 °C for 3 weeks to simulate transit temperatures and the time required to reach distant markets. \{MAPc\} maintained an average internal atmosphere of 12.3% \{O2\} + 5.6% \{CO2\} and significantly extended ‘Bartlett’ pear storage life with high eating quality and without \{IB\} and other disorders for up to 4 months at −1.1 °C. The internal gas atmosphere of \{MAPe\} equilibrated at 2.2% \{O2\} + 5.7% CO2, which resulted in fruit with 25.5 and 62.3% \{IB\} after 3 and 4 months of storage, respectively. During simulated transit conditions of 2, 4.5, 7.5, and 10 °C, the \{CO2\} level in \{MAPc\} was maintained at 5.6–7.9%, while \{O2\} was reduced dramatically to 10.5, 5.0, 2.5, and 1.0%, respectively. \{IB\} developed at 7.5 and 10 °C but not at 2 and 4.5 °C, regardless of pre-transit storage duration (1 and 3 months) at −1.1 °C. The longer the storage duration and the higher transit temperature, the higher the incidence and severity of IB. The MAP-related \{IB\} disorder observed in this study included two types of symptoms: classic pithy brown core and wet brown flesh. The \{MAPc\} storage gas atmospheres maintained fruit firmness, color and higher eating quality after ripening, eliminated senescent scald and core breakdown, suppressed the loss of ascorbic acid (AsA) and titratable acidity, and slowed the accumulation of malondialdehyde (MDA) during storage at −1.1 °C for up to 4 months or 3 months + 3 weeks at simulated transit temperatures of 2 and 4.5 °C. In contrast, fruit held in \{MAP\} with low \{O2\} levels (1.0–2.5%) developed \{IB\} that appeared to be associated with a reduction in AsA, accumulated \{MDA\} and exhibited an increase in membrane leakage. \{MAP\} inhibited ripening at high \{CO2\} + high \{O2\} but lead to \{IB\} when the packaging material or elevated temperatures resulted in high \{CO2\} + low \{O2\} conditions. The incidence of \{IB\} closely correlated with lipid peroxidation and appeared to be related to fruit AsA concentration. The \{MAPc\} designed for pears appears to be suitable for ‘Bartlett’ fruit stored at −1.1 °C for up to 4 months or storage for 3 months and a transportation duration of up to 3 weeks at 0–4.5 °C during the early season and at 0–2 °C during the late packing season. These conditions yielded fruit of high eating quality and without \{IB\} or over-ripening upon arrival at distant markets. "

abstract = "We investigated the potential of ionizing radiation for improving physiological responses, quality, and storage time of fresh guava fruit. Ionizing radiation treatment suppressed the respiration and ethylene production rates and thus retarded the process of fruit ripening during storage. Irradiation treatment also retarded the physical and biochemical changes associated with ripening such as firmness, titratable acidity, soluble solids content, and vitamin C during storage, but for doses higher than 0.25 kGy the vitamin C content decreased. The positive effects of ionizing radiation treatment on delayed fruit ripening and other quality attributes diminished during 22 days of storage at 10 °C. Thus, a combination of ionizing radiation with low-temperature storage (10 °C) did not have much synergistic effect on storage life and quality of guava fruit. In conclusion, ionizing radiation treatment of guava fruit with 0.25 kGy dose increased the postharvest life by 3–4 days, maintained fruit quality, and reduced the decay incidence. The optimal dose (0.25 kGy) for postharvest life extension of guava fruit may be exploited to provide phytosanitary security against many insect pests including fruit flies. "

Changes in visual and compositional attributes, aroma volatile production, respiration rate, and electrolyte leakage were evaluated in whole and fresh-cut partially ripe ‘Kent’ mangoes stored for 10 d at chilling (5 °C) and non-chilling (12 °C) temperatures in order to determine if fresh-cut mangoes are subject to chilling injury at their typical handling temperature. The experiment was conducted twice during two Florida mango seasons, with fruit from two different sources. Results from the two harvests were significantly different and therefore were analyzed separately. Visual quality degradation was faster at 12 °C than at 5 °C, and limited the shelf-life of the fresh-cut mangoes to 3–4 d at 12 °C versus 5–6 d at 5 °C. Soluble solids content did not differ among whole fruit or fresh-cut slices stored at either chilling or non-chilling temperatures, but respiration rate, pH, and total ascorbic acid were all lower and titratable acidity was higher in both the fresh-cut slices and whole fruit stored at 5 °C compared with storage at 12 °C. Subjective evaluation indicated that aroma intensity declined more during storage of fresh-cut slices at 5 °C than at 12 °C, and the aroma volatiles acetaldehyde, ethyl acetate, and ethyl butyrate were found to be significantly reduced in the slices stored at 5 °C, but only in the second harvest; production of alcohols (methanol and ethanol) was also lower in samples stored at 5 °C. Although electrolyte leakage was higher in fresh-cut slices than in whole fruit, no conclusion could be made regarding the effect of storage temperature. It is unclear whether the storage duration at 5 °C was sufficiently long to cause chilling injury in fresh-cut mango slices since no visual symptoms developed in whole fruit. However, lower ascorbic acid content, higher titratable acidity, reduction of volatiles, and increased softening of whole fruit at 5 °C versus 12 °C, which are all indicative of CI, suggest that the fresh-cut mango slices did experience chilling stress.

The content of vitamin C in fruits and vegetables can be influenced by various factors such as genotypic differences, preharvest climatic conditions and cultural practices, maturity and harvesting methods, and postharvest handling procedures. The higher the intensity of light during the growing season, the greater is vitamin C content in plant tissues. Nitrogen fertilizers at high rates tend to decrease the vitamin C content in many fruits and vegetables. Vitamin C content of many crops can be increased with less frequent irrigation. Temperature management after harvest is the most important factor to maintain vitamin C of fruits and vegetables; losses are accelerated at higher temperatures and with longer storage durations. However, some chilling sensitive crops show more losses in vitamin C at lower temperatures. Conditions favorable to water loss after harvest result in a rapid loss of vitamin C especially in leafy vegetables. The retention of vitamin C is lowered by bruising, and other mechanical injuries, and by excessive trimming. Irradiation at low doses (1 kGy or lower) has no significant effects on vitamin C content of fruits and vegetables. The loss of vitamin C after harvest can be reduced by storing fruits and vegetables in reduced \{O2\} and/or up to 10% \{CO2\} atmospheres; higher \{CO2\} levels can accelerate vitamin C loss. Vitamin C of produce is also subject to degradation during processing and cooking. Electromagnetic energy seems to have advantages over conventional heating by reduction of process times, energy, and water usage. Blanching reduces the vitamin C content during processing, but limits further decreases during the frozen-storage of horticultural products. "

The second was to evaluate the effects of 24 h of pre-storage cooling at 0 °C, 10 °C, and 23 °C followed by three weeks of room temperature storage on fruit storability and taste. Early fruit harvest increased fruit firmness, titratable acidity, and starch, with light fruit weight and low soluble solids content. Fruits harvested at 130 \{DAFB\} were in mid-climacteric phase. Free sugar composition was not consistently affected by DAFB. Harvesting at 125 \{DAFB\} retained fruit storability and suppressed occurrence of core breakdown compared to 130 \{DAFB\} or 135 \{DAFB\} at room temperature for 21 days. Pre-cooling at 10 °C produced firmer fruits, lower core breakdown, and better taste compared to pre-cooling at 0 °C and 23 °C or untreated control (no pre-cooling). "

Strawberries stored at higher temperature (10 °C) had higher activities of antioxidant enzymes and antioxidant capacities than those stored at lower temperatures (0 or 5 °C), in both organic and conventional cultural systems. In conclusion, strawberries produced from organic culture contained significantly higher antioxidant capacities and flavonoid contents than those produced from conventional culture, and even though low storage temperatures retarded decay, they also reduced the increase in antioxidant activities.

These methods, while simple and less laborious than following grain dry weight dynamics, are subjective and results can be affected by environmental conditions. The objective of the present work was to study the relationship between the dynamics of dry matter and water concentration (WC) of sunflower fruits, with the aim of identifying the timing of physiological maturity on the basis of fruit WC. The effects of brief periods of high temperature stress (lasting 4 or 6 days) during grain-filling were also explored. Eight different sunflower genotypes (inbred lines and hybrids) were studied in four separate experiments conducted under different growth conditions (greenhouse and field) and contrasting dates of sowing (autumn, spring and summer), generating a broad range of grain-filling durations (28–41 days) and final fruit weight (30–105 mg fruit−1). In these experiments the evolution of fruit fresh and dry weights were followed in fruit from the peripheral and intermediate positions on the capitulum from anthesis to harvest maturity. Tri-linear functions were fitted to the relative (to final) fruit dry weight (RFDW) to fruit \{WC\} relationships (R2 from 0.94 to 0.99). Across experiments, genotypes and fruit positions on the capitulum, \{PM\} in non-stressed plants was attained when fruits exhibited 38% WC. This model was validated against independent data, successfully simulating the dynamics of fruit dry weight based on fruit \{WC\} (r = 0.99; P &lt; 0.001). Verifications against published data generated by other authors also proved satisfactory. High temperature stress that caused a shortening of grain-filling and reductions in final fruit weight &gt;20% with respect to controls, raised fruit \{WC\} at \{PM\} to ca. 50%. Simulations were performed to explore the effects of variations in timing of anthesis that occur between positions on the capitulum and among plants in a crop on fruit \{WC\} at maximum yield. At a crop level, 38% \{WC\} in these simulations corresponded to grain yield &gt;95% of the maximum attainable when harvest was delayed until last growing fruits reached 38% WC. Simulations also showed that in crops exposed to high temperature during grain-filling, there would be no risk of shortfall with respect to potential yield using 38% \{WC\} as an indicator of PM. We conclude that this simple, fast and non-subjective method based on fruit \{WC\} would be useful to determine \{PM\} in sunflower. "

CsZfp encoded a putative protein of 173 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 18.44 kDa, an isoelectric point (pI) of 6.50 and grand average of hydropathicity (GRAVY) value of − 0.334. The gene did not have an intron, and belonged to a multi-gene family. During the period of active growth (PAG), CsZfp showed maximum expression in root and fruit as compared to leaf, floral bud and stem. Interaction studies between temperature and plant growth regulators on the expression of CsZfp showed that \{ABA\} upregulated CsZfp expression at growth temperature (GT; 25 °C) but had no effect at low temperature (LT; 4 °C). In response to GA3, upregulation was observed at \{LT\} but not at GT. Further, the expression was not modulated by \{LT\} either in the tissue harvested during \{PAG\} or during WD. It was interesting to record that the expression of CsZfp was upregulated by hydrogen peroxide and sodium chloride, whereas it was non-responsive to polyethylene glycol. The possible role of CsZfp in playing key but differential roles in tea to various abiotic stresses is discussed. "

The aim of this study is to model the increase in fruit size during cell expansion based on diameter or length and to predict fruit size and volume, including the variation in size and volume, at harvest. The size of individual fruit during growth of fruit (four apple, two tomato and six pepper cultivars) was measured from early fruit set until harvest at several seasons. Size data were evaluated as diameter and length using the von Bertalanffy growth model, adapted to include the variation in size between individuals and the effect of growing temperature. The adapted von Bertalanffy model describes the increase in diameter and length and their variation. For any fruit type, size increased along the same generic growth model. A single stochastic variable, the biological shift factor, was sufficient to describe the variation in development time, initial size and maximum size. For all batches the percentage variation explained for were well over 93% with growth rate constants similar per species and only a minor effect of growing temperature. Prediction of the maximum size distribution based on measurements half way the cell expansion period is explored and discussed. Size and its distribution can be predicted based on a single measuring point in time but with two or three points in time the prediction system becomes more robust. "

In order to investigate the effect of ethanol application on postharvest storage at room temperature (24 °C) and quality of oriental sweet melon, we measured physiological and quality changes induced by ethanol vapor or ethanol injection. Both ethanol treatments significantly inhibited internal ethylene concentrations (IEC), and no ethylene peak occurred when compared with control fruit during storage. However, both ethanol treatments maintained firmness but without significant differences between ethanol-treated and the control melons, except with ethanol injection on day 4. Soluble solids contents were not affected by either treatments. Glucose, fructose and sucrose contents showed a greater increase in ethanol-treated melon flesh and peel tissues than in controls after four days, especially sucrose, the main sugar in melons. Compared with the control, both ethanol treatments resulted in different profiles and composition of aromatic volatile compounds during storage. Both ethanol treatments resulted in a significant increase in ethyl acetate, hexyl acetate and 2-methyl-1-butyle acetate, and a decrease of 2,3-butanediyl diacetate, phenylmethyl acetate and 2-phenethyl acetate. The contents of total esters, including eight newly detected ethyl esters, were 2–4 fold higher in ethanol-treated melons. Ethanol injection more effectively increased accumulation of aroma volatile compounds for a short time, while the effects of ethanol vapor persisted during the storage. Both ethanol treatments increased alcohol acyltransferase (AAT) activity in melon flesh within four days, and levels peaked three days earlier but lower than in the control. There were no significant differences in activities of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and lipoxygenase (LOX) in ethanol-treated and control melons. In summary, postharvest ethanol application reduced the \{IEC\} of harvested oriental melons and improved levels of volatile aroma compounds, especially the ethyl esters. "

The term colorimetric coordinate a expresses the variation from green to yellow during lemon fruit ripening. In this work we attempt to determine the temperature below which degreening begins in three varieties of lemon fruit on the tree: Eureka, Lisbon and Fino. Only the results for Eureka are described since all three varieties showed the same behavior. The colorimetric coordinate a was measured weekly in the peel of previously marked and identified lemon fruit over a period of 7 years, and the temperature was recorded in a weather station situated on the same farm. The results show that degreening begins when the minimum temperatures fall below 10.5 °C for 2 days (not necessarily consecutive). In our experiment the mean daily minimum temperature recorded for the previous 7 and 21 days were 12.14 °C and 13.64 °C, respectively. This implies that a knowledge of autumn temperatures should enable growers to know when it is best to harvest the fruit – when degreening has just begun (with a shortened artificial degreening period) or when more time has elapsed, although this may mean that the commercial opportunity associated with early fruit may be lost.

The results indicated that the softening ability of fruits depend on the source. All fruits are unsoftened at 30°C and 70°C. In general, the optimum conditions for fruits to be softened varied from 45–50°C during 40–60 minutes. On average, whatever the origins, fruits can be softed at 45±4°C during 45±9. Only fruits from three different localities can be softened even at 60°C. It was also found that, fruits started drying 3–4 days after harvesting when they were stored at 2.3°C and 25°C with the percentage of softened fruits decreasing considerably. Only fruits from one locality had high softening ability after 6 days. Storage at −4°C had no effect on the softening abilities of fruits after 30 days of storage. "

To date, appearance quality assessment is determined subjectively using visual observation. Computer vision analysis is an useful tool to evaluate fruit optical properties. The objective of this work was to study quality indicators for different blueberry cultivars hand-harvested in Chile during storage using computer vision. Five cultivars were analyzed: Briggitte, Duke, Elliot, Centurion and Star; 50 individual fruit from these cultivars were stored at 4 °C and 15 °C during 21 days at 90% of relative humidity. Quality indicators: colour, presence of epicuticular wax (EW), size, dehydratation and microbial growth were determined through image analysis obtained by computer vision. Different values of each quality attribute were obtained between cultivars. Dehydratation values (measured as sample size changes during storage) at 15 °C were 2.7 and 39.6% for Briggitte and Centurion, respectively. \{EW\} presence for all was lower of 33% of the surface, which is the minimum for export, except to cv. Briggitte (75%), which was associated to low dehydratation. Colour measured with CIEL*a*b* scale showed changes from blue to red for all cultivars at both temperatures during storage. Fungal presence increased at higher temperatures, which was represented by an increased lightness. The implication of this work is that computer vision analysis is useful to objective quality evaluation of fruits such as colour, dehydratation signs and fungal growth - most important attributes for consumers- and epicuticular wax presence, which is important to protect against deteriorative changes during storage, allowing heterogeneous materials analysis and their possible application in on-line packing control.

Thus, in this study, a non-ventilated biodegradable container was evaluated as a possible alternative to the containers normally used in commercial distribution of small berries. To determine the potential of biodegradable containers for small berries, highbush blueberries were packaged in polylactide (PLA) containers and stored at 10 °C for 18 days and at 23 °C for 9 days. Commercial vented clamshell containers were used as controls. Physicochemical and microbiological studies were carried out in order to compare the efficacy of both packages.

The research focuses on the study of vitamin C changes in Latvia grown wild (Vaccinium oxycoccus L.) and cultivated (Vaccinium macrocarpon Ait.) cranberries during convective and microwave vacuum drying. Latvian wild cranberries and cultivated cranberry varieties ‘Early Black’, ‘Ben Lear’, ‘Stevens’, ‘Bergman’ and ‘Pilgrim’ from Kurzeme region harvested in 2010 were used for experiments. Mechanical and thermal pre-treatment of fresh berries was applied for better water evaporation in drying process. During experiments the berries were dried: in a convective air dryer by controlled hot air stream circulation velocity of 1.2 m s-1 at temperature +50±2 °C. The berries were placed on the perforated sieve (diameter 0.185 m, diameter of holes – 0.002 m); the moisture content of dried berries was 9.0±0.1%. Following quality parameters were analysed during experiments: moisture content (oven-drying method) and vitamin C content (LVS \{EN\} 14130:2003). Experimentally it was ascertained that drying time of berries by various drying methods mainly depends on the pre-treatment manner. During the drying process moisture content of cranberries decreased from on average 86.94% to 9.00%, about ∼10.00 times. Vitamin C is the least stable of all vitamins and it can be easily degraded during processing and storage. The most harmful factors to vitamin C content are the presence of oxygen, prolonged heating in the air ambiance and exposure to light. The initial content of vitamin C in wild and cultivated fresh cranberries was differing, which mainly depends on varieties’ individuality. Current research proved that vitamin C content loss in cranberries processed by microwave vacuum drying method comparing with drying in convective cabinet type dryer was smaller. "

Ceres and Grabouw, in the Western Cape Province of South Africa in the 2007−2008 and 2008−2009 seasons. Peel discs were punched from the shaded sides of fruit, placed on peltier temperature plates set to a temperature range from 16−31 °C with 3 °C intervals and exposed to photosynthetic photon flux (PPF) of 550–650 μmol m−2 s−1 for 72 h where after their change in hue was determined. The study focused on the effect of temperature on red colour development in the month before the onset of commercial harvest, which is when anthocyanin synthesis peaks in the cultivars grown in South Africa. Although apples from Ceres generally increased more in redness than apples from Grabouw, the general pattern of colour development over the temperature range studied was the same for fruit from both areas. Colour development generally showed a quadratic response to temperature with the greatest change in red colour developing from 19−25 °C in 2007−2008 and 16−22 °C in 2008−2009. Red colour development in \{RG\} peaked at a higher temperature range of 22–28 °C in 2007−2008. The response to temperature was less clearly defined in \{ERO\} where red colour developed over a broad temperature range and also in \{RG\} where differences were not significant in 2008−2009. The lower optimum temperature ranges for red colour development in 2008−2009 compared to 2007−2008 for FJ, \{BB\} and \{CP\} suggest that climatic conditions during fruit development affect the potential to synthesise anthocyanin. The “adaptation” of anthocyanin biosynthesis to climate may hinder the selection of suitable sites for cultivation of red and blushed cultivars. "

Studies have shown that the production and quality of fresh fruit and vegetable crops can be directly and indirectly affected by high temperatures and exposure to elevated levels of carbon dioxide and ozone. Temperature increase affects photosynthesis directly, causing alterations in sugars, organic acids, and flavonoids contents, firmness and antioxidant activity. Carbon dioxide accumulation in the atmosphere has directly effects on postharvest quality causing tuber malformation, occurrence of common scab, and changes in reducing sugars contents on potatoes. High concentrations of atmospheric ozone can potentially cause reduction in the photosynthetic process, growth and biomass accumulation. Ozone-enriched atmospheres increased vitamin C content and decreased emissions of volatile esters on strawberries. Tomatoes exposed to ozone concentrations ranging from 0.005 to 1.0 μmol/mol had a transient increase in β-carotene, lutein and lycopene contents. "

At different times during storage, flesh firmness and cortical tensile strength were measured on fruit at storage temperature, after 24 h at 20°C, or after 24 h at 20°C followed by 24 h at the storage temperature. ‘Royal Gala’, ‘Granny Smith’ and ‘Cox's Orange Pippin’ fruit had higher firmness readings at harvest when measured at 20°C than at 0–3°C, but after 50–100 days at 0–3°C firmness and tensile strength readings were greater when measured at 0–3°C than at 20°C. ‘Pacific Rose™’ had similar firmness and tensile strength readings when measured at 0°C and 20°C. ‘Royal Gala’ and ‘Cox's Orange Pippin’ were measured for firmness at different fruit temperatures at harvest and after storage. The relationship between firmness readings and fruit temperature between 0 and 20°C was linear and positive at harvest and linear and negative for stored fruit. Firmness change with temperature was not affected by orchard or harvest maturity. These results suggest that physical changes in firmness with fruit temperature are common for the cultivars studied, and thus could be used to compare firmness values for fruit from different orchards that were measured at different temperatures.

The aim of this experiment was to compare sap flow and canopy temperature (Tc) measurements with more classical methods like ψs or gs to predict the effect of deficit irrigation on fresh fruit weight in citrus trees. The experiment was performed during the summer of 2011 in a “Clementina de Nules” orchard undergoing RDI. Sap flow was determined by means of the compensation heat pulse method in well-watered and \{RDI\} trees. Tc was measured continuously with infrared thermometers (IRTs) mounted over the canopies and also weekly with an infrared hand-operated thermographic camera taking frontal images of the sunlit side of tree crowns. Concurrently, ψs and gs were also measured on all trees. Results showed that the evolution of the relative transpiration obtained with the sap flow sensors was in agreement with the plant water stress experienced. The values of Tc obtained with the fixed IRTs, normalized by air temperature (Tc − Ta) were in general poorly related with ψs and gs. However, when Tc was obtained from thermal imaging, there was a good correlation with ψs in days of relatively high water stress (i.e. when ψs differences among treatments were &gt;1.0 MPa). The average fruit weight at harvest was significantly correlated with all the stress indicators, and the best correlation was that of thermographic Tc followed by ψs and gs. Overall, results showed that in citrus trees Tc measurement obtained from thermal imaging is a good tool to predict the effect of water deficit on fresh fruit weight. "

The Plant Experiment Unit was designed to be installed in the Cell Biology Experiment Facility and to support the seed-to-seed life cycle experiment of Arabidopsis plants in space in the project named Space Seed. Ground-based experiments to test the Plant Experiment Unit showed that the unit needed further improvement of a system to control the water content of a seedbed using an infrared moisture analyzer and that it was difficult to keep the relative humidity inside the Plant Experiment Unit between 70 and 80% because the Cell Biology Experiment Facility had neither a ventilation system nor a dehumidifying system. Therefore, excess moisture inside the Cell Biology Experiment Facility was removed with desiccant bags containing calcium chloride. Eight flight models of the Plant Experiment Unit in which dry Arabidopsis seeds were fixed to the seedbed with gum arabic were launched to the International Space Station in the space shuttle STS-128 (17A) on August 28, 2009. Plant Experiment Unit were installed in the Cell Biology Experiment Facility with desiccant boxes, and then the Space Seed experiment was started in the Japanese Experiment Module, named Kibo, which was part of the International Space Station, on September 10, 2009 by watering the seedbed and terminated 2 months later on November 11, 2009.

This paper reports on using a hyperspectral imaging technique for measurement of laser-induced fluorescence from apple fruit for predicting multiple fruit quality parameters. A continuous wave blue laser (408 nm) was used as an excitation source for inducing fluorescence in apples. Fluorescence scattering images were acquired from ‘Golden Delicious’ apples by a hyperspectral imaging system at the instance of laser illumination (0 min) and after 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 min of illumination. The hyperspectral fluorescence image data were represented by mean, maximum, and standard deviation spectra. Standard tests were performed on measuring fruit skin and flesh color, firmness, soluble solids content, and titratable acid. A hybrid method of combining principal component analysis and neural network modeling was used for developing prediction models to predict fruit quality parameters for each of the six illumination time periods. Fluorescence emission decreased steadily during the first 3 min of illumination and was stable within 5 min. The 0-min fluorescence prediction models had somewhat poorer prediction results for individual quality parameters except skin hue than did the models of longer illumination time. The differences were minimal in the model prediction results from the fluorescence data at 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 min of illumination. Overall, excellent predictions were obtained for apple skin hue with the correlation coefficient of prediction of 0.94. Relatively good predictions were obtained for fruit firmness, skin chroma, and flesh hue with values for the correlation coefficient being equal to or greater than 0.74 for 1 min of illumination or longer times, and poorer correlations were found for soluble solids content, titratable acid, and flesh chroma. Hyperspectral laser-induced fluorescence imaging is potentially useful for assessing selected quality parameters of apple fruit and further research is needed to improve fluorescence measurement for better prediction of fruit quality.

abstract = "Mature and immature ‘Kensington’ mangoes (Mangifera indica Linn.) were treated with an experimental high humidity hot air treatment (HT) to a fruit core temperature of 46.5 °C for 10 min for disinfestation purposes and to test for fruit injury reportedly associated with fruit immaturity. Two methods of determining fruit maturity were examined with fruit harvested over two different seasons, in order to gain a broad range of maturities. No internal or external injury was caused to fruit at any maturity stage by the treatment. Mature \{HT\} fruit softened faster and had increased skin colour development compared to immature \{HT\} fruit. \{HT\} shows commercial potential since the physiological changes associated with treatment and maturity can be managed with careful postharvest handling practices. We recommend only mature fruit be harvested and treated since quality and market performance will be maximised. "

Achieving this requirement is complicated by the floral ontogeny of banana which induces flowering and fruit production throughout the year. At the two experimental localities Burgershall and Levubu, in the Eastern Transvaal, totals of 2571 and 2057 ratoon ‘Williams’ banana bunches, respectively, from uniform plantations, were analysed over a 3-year period. Mean flower emergence to harvest interval and mean bunch mass were calculated for 24 flowering periods of 15 days each. Seasonal variations at both localities were substantial and were related to temperatures prevailing at flower initiation and during fruit development. At Burgershall, the shortest flowering to harvest interval was 110 days (early summer flowering) and the longest 204 days (autumn flowering). Bunch mass varied from 57.8 kg (July flowering) to 37.2 kg (October flowering), the latter bunches resulting from winter flower initiation. Levubu data differed substantially from Burgershall, although the seasonal trends were similar. A practical crop forecasting model is proposed which is based on new flower counts every 15 days, and the overall box/bunch potential of the grower. Using the experimental data base, the total boxes are forecast from seasonal yield adjustment factors, and harvest spread is forecast from the harvest distribution of experimental bunches for each flowering period. Each cultivar-locality combination must be forecast separately, and the model assumes year-to-year uniformity, farm-to-farm uniformity, optimum management, and an absence of major damage due to wind, hail or frost.

Partial ripening of tomato and other fruits has also been shown to reduce chilling sensitivity. To test the relative merits of these “treatments”, tomato fruit (cv. ‘Rutgers’) were harvested when mature-green, held 3 days at ripening or heat-stress temperature (20 or 38°C, respectively), chilled for 20 days at 5°C, and assessed for ripening and injury over 7 subsequent days at 20°C. Based on chromaticity (a∗) values, lycopene content, rates of \{CO2\} and ethylene evolution, and visible injury (pitting on shoulders), heat-treated (38°C) fruit sustained more chilling injury and ripened much more slowly than the partially-ripened (20°C) controls. Membrane lipids extracted from outer pericarp tissue from 0 day, 3 day control, and 3 day heat-treated fruits were also analyzed. Lipid changes after 3 days at 20°C were typical of early ripening, whereas several anomalous changes occurred during 3 days at 38°C, most notably, a drop in steryl esters, large increases in phospholipids and cerebrosides, and a decrease in fatty-acid unsaturation in galacto- and phospholipids. These results show that, under certain conditions, heat treatment of tomato fruit may not reduce chilling injury as effectively as partial ripening. "

abstract = "In the Western Cape region of South Africa, mild weather during the late season is conducive to continued high rates of photosynthesis in apple trees. During the post-harvest period, both stressful environmental conditions and altered tree carbohydrate demand (sink strength) may influence stomatal function and thus gas exchange and tree water requirements. In this study we investigated the interactive effects of the main atmospheric determinants of stomatal conductance (light, leaf temperature, leaf-to-air vapour pressure deficit (VPD)) in response to fruit removal at harvest and soil moisture stress after harvest (cessation of irrigation). An 8-year-old ‘Braestar’ orchard was used. Pre- and post-harvest (pre-senescent) photosynthetic light response curves were generated at leaf temperatures of 20–40 °C. Stomatal conductance showed increased sensitivity to increasing leaf temperature after harvest, resulting in a reduction in the optimum temperature for photosynthesis from 25–30 to 20–25 °C. This ensured the maintenance of high instantaneous leaf water use efficiency (WUE) post-harvest at all temperatures, compared to reductions in \{WUE\} but higher photosynthetic rates at high leaf temperature pre-harvest. We suggest that this reflects a change from a carbohydrate-demanding strategy (high sink demand) pre-harvest, to a water-conserving strategy post-harvest when sink demand is reduced. Following harvest, daily irrigation was either shut off or continued for 11 days, and light-saturated gas exchange measured regularly at varying levels of \{VPD\} in droughted trees. Photosynthetic rates, stomatal conductances and intercellular \{CO2\} concentration (ci) remained relatively constant for the first 6 days, followed by reductions linked to a period of high ambient atmospheric evaporative demand and subsequent partial recovery. Droughted and non-droughted trees showed similar gas exchange values at the end of the droughting period when measured at 25 °C, but gas exchange of droughted trees remained repressed when measured at 30 °C due to increased non-stomatal limitation. Throughout the study, only cuvette \{VPD\} levels above 3.5 kPa (measured at 30 °C) significantly reduced gas exchange, with no interaction with duration of droughting. This study showed that post-harvest stomatal control was more attuned to ambient atmospheric evaporative demand in the orchard than to slowly developing soil moisture stress. We conclude that both atmospheric factors and changing sink demand influence stomatal control of apple leaves post-harvest, and that this should be taken into account when determining irrigation strategies.

An in vitro digestion system was used to generate the soluble bioaccessable digestate which was then fractionated into phenolic and non-phenolic fractions. The two fractions were assayed for Folin-Ciocalteu Reaction (FCR) reducing capacity and peroxyl radical scavenging capacity. Quality retention of the fruit was assessed by measuring internal ethylene concentration, firmness and titratable acidity. Treatment with 1-MCP inhibited internal ethylene concentration and better maintained the firmness and titratable acidity of ‘Sunrise’ summer apples as compared with untreated control apples at storage temperatures of 15 °C and above. The \{FCR\} reducing capacity of the phenolic fraction of the in vitro, simulated gastrointestinal digestates showed similar response as did the quality measures, with significantly higher activity in the 1-MCP treated fruit at higher storage temperatures. However, no consistent differences were found between 1-MCP and control treatments for the \{FCR\} reducing capacity of the non-phenolic fraction or for the peroxyl radical scavenging capacity of either fraction.

The samples were kept at room temperature (20 °C) and analyzed for shelf life. Significant difference in coated and control fruits were observed and all the coated fruits delayed ripening process that was characterized by reduction in weight loss and restricted changes in soluble solids concentration, titratable acidity, ascorbic acid content, firmness and decay percentage compared to uncoated sample. The formulations containing sorbitol were found to be the most effective followed by combined plasticizers (glycerol: sorbitol) and glycerol. Sensory evaluation conducted to monitor the change in color, texture and aroma also proved the efficacy of \{MKS\} coating containing sorbitol by retaining the overall postharvest quality of tomato during the storage period. The results showed that \{MKS\} could be a promising coating material for tomatoes that delayed the ripening process up to 20 days during storage at 20 °C with no adverse effect on postharvest quality.

First pick fruit were used for this study and untreated (UTC) fruit were harvested at commercial maturity based on changes in skin ground colour and flesh firmness. Two harvest criteria were used for AVG-treated fruit. ReTA fruit were harvested when the colour of the fruit was identical to the \{UTC\} (3 days after \{UTC\} first pick) and ReTB fruit were harvested when the fruit firmness had declined to the same level as the \{UTC\} (7 days after \{UTC\} first pick). Fruit were stored for 5 weeks at 1.0–1.5 °C with and without continuous ventilation with 30 μL L−1 ethylene. All fruit had similarly low rates of ethylene production when received and ethylene production remained low in all AVG-treated fruit but exhibited a climacteric rise in untreated fruit. The fruit were assessed weekly for changes in flesh firmness and storage disorders (internal bleeding and percentage juice recovery) 6 days after transfer from cool storage to 20 °C. AVG-treated fruit remained firmer than untreated fruit after 6 days of ripening following harvest but this difference was absent in fruit ripened after 1 week of cool storage. Internal bleeding was detected after 2 weeks of air storage in ReTA and ReTB fruit but not until 3 weeks in \{UTC\} fruit. A decrease in percentage juice recovery was found in all treatments after 3 weeks of air storage but ReTA fruit were the most affected. A loss of ability to soften normally was found in all treatments after 4 weeks of storage in air but the continuous application of ethylene during storage maintained normal softening except in ReTA fruit. \{UTC\} and ReTB fruit started to go ‘mealy’ (&lt;20 N firmness, loss of juiciness) after 3 weeks storage but by 4–5 weeks most fruit were ‘leathery’ (&gt;20 N firmness, loss of juice).

In this study, California strawberries purchased at retail stores were treated with continuously generated ClO2 gas over concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 5.0 mg/L for durations ranging from 7 to 1000 min to determine how ClO2 gas impacts fungal mortality and fruit quality as a function of treatment concentration, treatment duration, and ClO2 absorption by the fruit. Repeated measures and Gompertz models were used to infer on the efficacy of the ClO2 gas, and a novel method was used to quantify the ClO2 absorption by fresh produce. It was found that ClO2 gas treatments have minimal effect at delaying the onset or growth rate of Botrytis cinerea for treatments followed by incubation at 4 or 22 °C even when corrected for natural variability of Botrytis cinerea presence among batches of strawberries, indicating that treatments are not sufficient for shelf-life extension.

Processing of dates by blanching in water at 96±1 °C and subsequent dehydration at 60±2 °C for 18–20 h resulted in good quality dehydrated dates as compared to the dates dried without heat treatment. The dehydrated dates were found to be acceptable with respect to colour, flavour, taste and overall quality. The dehydrated dates contained a total sugars of 520 g kg−1, reducing sugars of 415.1 g kg−1, tannins 13.5 g kg−1 and ascorbic acid 33.7 mg kg−1. Equilibrium relative humidity (ERH) of the dehydrated dates was found to be 75.9% with an initial moisture content of 159 g kg−1. The dehydrated dates packed in 75 μ low-density polyethylene packaging material were shelf stable for 6 months at room temperature. The dehydrated dates remained acceptable during the storage period.

The stem scar of half of the harvested fruit was sealed using nail polish and weight loss of sealed and non-sealed fruit determined daily at 20 °C (5 d storage) and bi-weekly at 0 °C (15 d storage). Fruit firmness was determined at the end of the storage period. The stem scar accounted for approximately 40% of the moisture lost at 20 °C, but percentages varied considerably between lines. While the stem scar covered 0.19% to 0.74% of the fruit surface area, its rate of transpiration was 170-times higher than for the cuticle at 20 °C. The larger the fruit scar area, the greater was the absolute rate of water loss, but scar size scar did not affect the rate of weight loss expressed on a per gram fruit basis. Higher levels of water loss were associated with a greater loss in firmness; fruit having a large scar had a greater rate of water loss and were less firm than those having medium or small scars. The water permeance of the fruit cuticle varied two-fold and the apparent permeance of the scar varied three-fold among the 9 lines evaluated when held at 20 °C. Interestingly, one line exhibited a 75% lower rate of water loss from its stem scar than the other lines than would be predicted based on its scar diameter. Storage at 0 °C reduced the rate of water loss by 90% but the cuticle permeance was not affected by temperature. Sealing the stem scar increased fruit firmness retention at 0 °C and 20 °C, but provided less benefit at 0 °C vs. 20 °C. The highly variable nature of water loss through the stem scar and the cuticle in this study suggests that large gains in reductions in water loss are possible for the highbush blueberry once the mechanisms for transpiration are better understood.

During cold storage at 0 ± 5 °C, the decay rate, fruit firmness, and indices relating to respiration and reactive-oxygen metabolism were detected regularly. Results showed that irradiation treatment with 1.0 kGy to 2.5 kGy doses was able to inhibit the respiration intensity, ethylene production, and the improvement of lipoxygenase (LOX) activity, thus reducing the increase of malondialdehyde (MDA) content and the permeability of cell membranes. In addition, irradiation treatment can improve the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and peroxidase (POD) to eliminate, on a continual basis, the constantly generated superoxide anions (O2−) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), keeping them at a low level: ultimately, this effectively guaranteed the storage quality and postponed the senescence process in the blueberry fruits. Meanwhile, those irradiated at 2.5 kGy presented optimal preservation effects as the respiration was inhibited to the utmost extent and the anti-oxidisation effect was enhanced. The results prove that the 60Co γ-irradiation treatment at proper doses is an effective method of storing post-harvest blueberry fruits at low temperatures. "

Physical measurements on the date fruit, pit and flesh, measurements of the fruit's pitting pressure, shear pressure and modulus of elasticity, as well as sensory evaluation, were carried out on freshly harvested and stored samples. Significant variations in measured attributes were observed with storage treatments, but the two varieties did not behave similarly under matching storage conditions. Quality was best maintained after storage of 2 months at −3 °C for Khalas, and 1 year at −3 °C for Barhee. Overall, storage time and temperature as independent factors alone did not account for all of the observed variation in the studied attributes of Khalas and Barhee. Principal component analysis revealed that most of the variation of the stored dates comes from “size”, followed by “texture” variables. The work pointed to some probable chemical and physiological systems responsible for deterioration of dates, the understanding of which can prove extremely helpful in developing methods of short- and long-term preservation of the fruit.

The optimum harvest period was precisely predicted by the meteorological conditions well in advance, and the latter showed significant correlations with the actual optimum harvest period determined by starch pattern index and seed colour index. Based on these meteorological factors, a “key year” concept was evolved to reliably predict the optimum harvest period. Since this concept was based on all the interrelated meteorological conditions, a prediction would be more reliable under varying climatic conditions in any ensuing season if considered for the period of 242 days from November to June.

This study analysed the effect of these factors on the content of different antioxidants (vitamin C, ellagic acid, anthocyanins and total phenolics) in raspberries (Rubus idaeus L. cv. Polka) and blackberries (Rubus fructicosus L. cv. Loch Ness) during storage. The analyses were performed using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with photodiode array detection. Ellagic acid content during storage ranged between 104 and 114 mg/100 g fresh weight in raspberries and 172 and 182 mg/100 g fresh weight in blackberries. Anthocyanin content increased during storage from 64 to 77 mg/100 g fresh weight in raspberries, but decreased from 199 to 162 mg/100 g fresh weight in blackberries. Vitamin C content in raspberries ranged during storage between 22 and 28 mg/100 g fresh weight, but in blackberries values were lower (10–12 mg/100 g fresh weight). Significant changes in total phenolics and sugars occurred during different storage periods (0–9 or 10 days). The results suggest that late season raspberries and blackberries maintain high quality in terms of antioxidant content. "

The control of carob moth is a mandatory process for exported fruits, and the main chemical method used to prevent pest diseases of palm date is methyl bromide. However, its use is being restricted due to direct, harmful effects to the environment, and indirect effects on humans. Hot air treatments (HATs) could be physical alternatives to methyl bromide and other chemicals. Three \{HATs\} (55 °C for 30 min, 60 °C for 15 min, 60 °C for 20 min) were studied on Deglet Noor date fruits when stored for 45 d at 2 °C followed by a retail period of 4 d at 23 °C. The results showed that the use of \{HATs\} led to 100% E. ceratoniae larvae mortality in naturally-infested date. These \{HATs\} did not cause any damage on fruit quality and reduced mesophilic bacterial counts (&lt;1 log CFU g−1). These HATs, especially the combination of highest temperature and longer time of application (60 °C for 20 min), decreased the antioxidant activity (25% in \{DPPH\} and 14% in \{FRAP\} assay). Storage time also had a significant impact, reducing color (h°), antioxidant activity, and total phenolic content of date fruits (39%). When this storage was accompanied by a retail period at 23 °C, the firmness and sensorial parameters of date fruits was significantly reduced. Nevertheless, all date fruits from \{HATs\} and control treatments maintained their marketability quality for 45 d at 2 °C followed by a retail period of 4 d at 23 °C. Results show that \{HATs\} are a physical, non-chemical, treatment for E. ceratoniae larvae mortality that maintained date fruits' postharvest quality. "

This appeared to be the result of an induction of Pp-ACS1 transcription, making this genotype of particular interest for studying temperature stress physiology and ethylene-related ripening processes in peaches. Comparative expression analyses of genes involved in cell wall metabolism pointed out the presence of a negative (Pp-EG4), positive (Pp-endoPG) or no (one member of the \{PL\} family) relationship with ethylene at ripening. Results clearly showed that the last stage of firmness decrease (melting) only occurs in fruit producing ethylene and is associated with Pp-endoPG transcript accumulation. The expression of genes involved in ethylene biosynthesis and signalling pathways was evaluated using QRT-PCR. Pp-ACO1 appeared to be induced in \{SH\} kept at 10 °C but not at 20 °C.

There were only small, non-significant differences in germinability among seeds harvested 35, 42 and 49 DPA, all of which were of higher quality than seeds which had been harvested 28 DPA. Immature seeds (21 DPA) had very poor germinability. Germinability of all seed lots increased during the first 0.5–5 years of storage. Mature seeds retained their high germinability till the end of the 10 years storage period, whereas the germinability of half-mature and immature seeds declined after 5–6 years of storage. Fermentation only improved the germination of half-mature and immature fresh seeds. Drying at low temperature (10 °C) tended to decrease seed longevity. Removal of the seed coat after 6 or 12 months of storage significantly increased germination. Immature seeds absorbed more water during imbibition than mature seeds, and this may be a reason for their low germinability. "

abstract = "This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of different ambient water temperatures on growth and population structure of freshwater prawns raised under standardized culture conditions. Juvenile prawns averaging 0.26 ± 0.14 g were stocked into seven 0.04 ha ponds at two study sites. Three ponds were located in Kentucky (KSU:latitude 38 °12′) with seasonal water temperatures averaging 24–26 °C. Four ponds were located in Mississippi (MSU:latitude 33 ° 28′) with a seasonal average of approximately 30 °C. Prawn stocking, sampling, and harvest dates were identical at both locations. Juvenile prawns were single source and were harvested from the same nursery tank for stocking at both locations. The diet used at both sites was from a single production run and was stored under refrigerated conditions. Prawns at both sites were fed twice daily according to a computer generated feeding schedule. Beginning approximately 8 weeks prior to harvest, sampled prawns were also individually identified according to sexual morphotype. At harvest (117 days after stocking) all prawns at both sites were counted, morphotyped, and weighed. Prawn weights were higher at the more northerly site at all samples after 42 days post-stocking. When sampled 64 days post-stocking (5 August) no sexually mature male or females were found. Mature morpho-types were first captured in the Day 83 sampling (25 August). In the Day 106 sampling (16 September), there were no significant differences (P &gt; 0.05) in numbers or weights of the three male morphotypes between sites. However, among females there were significantly fewer (P &lt;- 0.01) berried females at \{KSU\} with their average weights being significantly greater (P &lt;- 0.05) than those at \{MSU\} (35 g and 31 g, respectively). At harvest (Day 117: 27 September) \{KSU\} had significantly (P &lt;- 0.05) fewer berried females (32%) and more virgins (45%) than \{MSU\} (56% and 25%, respectively). Berried females at \{KSU\} weighed significantly more than at \{MSU\} (33 g and 26 g, respectively). There were no statistically significant differences (P &gt; 0.05) between the two sites in prawn survival (83%), average weight (35 g), and feed conversion (2.3). Production was significantly greater (P ≤ 0.01) at \{KSU\} (1261 kg ha−1) than \{MSU\} (1091 kg ha−1) largely reflecting higher average weights of some morphotypes and slightly higher survivals. Differences in proportions and sizes of female morphotypes probably indicate delayed sexual maturation at the more northerly site, prolonging somatic growth which normally ceases when food energies are redirected to reproductive activities.

Experiments were carried out according to a Box-Behnken matrix. Multiple regression analyses showed that both models yielded a good prediction of yeast density. The effect of relative humidity appeared greater than that of temperature. The number of yeast colony-forming units per square centimeter of apple fruit surface increased with increasing relative humidity, temperature, and initial applied yeast concentration. The models predict that under optimal growth conditions (25 °C, 98%), strains O and K should reach a density of 104 CFU/cm2 when applied initially at 2 × 107 (strain O) or 107 CFU/ml (strain K). The model results suggest that rainfall was likely the principal cause of the variability of yeast efficacy reported for previous preharvest orchard trials spanning two successive years. Temperature may also contribute to this variation. The models developed here are important tools for predicting population densities of both strains on the apple surface within the experimental limits. The use of these results should contribute to achieving yeast densities of 104 CFU/cm2 on apples by controlling yeast application and environmental factors such as relative humidity and temperature. The results of this study also confirm our previous in vitro findings that water activity has a greater effect than temperature on yeast population density. "

In this work, hybrid soft computing techniques were applied to design a model able to estimate Ψ st based on agro-meteorological and soil water content data. A Takagi–Sugeno–Kang fuzzy inference system (TSK-FIS) was obtained. This kind of model approximates non-linear systems by combining a set of functions local to fuzzy regions described by fuzzy rules. Such models have approximative power and are sufficiently descriptive. Starting from a set of input–output data, inputs relevant to Ψ st were automatically selected and fuzzy rules were identified based on the fuzzy clusters found in the data. The rule parameters were optimized by means of a neuro-fuzzy approach. The result was an accurate (86% variance explained) and simple model with five rules that considered soil water content at 0.3 m depth, the day of the year and mean daily air temperature as input variables, confirming the suitability of such approach. In addition, a rule simplification method allowed a consistent agro-linguistic interpretation of the fuzzy sets of the rules: DRY, \{MOIST\} and \{WET\} for the soil water content, BLOOM, \{FRUIT\} GROWTH, \{EARLY\} \{POSTHARVEST\} and \{LATE\} \{POSTHARVEST\} for the day of the year, and COLD, \{MILD\} and \{WARM\} for mean daily air temperature.

Fruit stored in air developed both flesh breakdown (FB) and senescent scald (SCALD) disorders alter 4 months of storage. Incidence of \{FB\} and \{SCALD\} increased after 5 and 6 months of storage. Development of \{FB\} disorder in air-stored fruit was not associated with the activity of pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC) or alcohol dehydrogenase. Changes in α-farnesene and conjugated trienes in the peel tissue were highly associated with the development of SCALD. CA-stored fruit were free from \{SCALD\} disorder regardless of \{CA\} regime and storage time but developed internal browning (IB) disorder after 4 months of storage. Incidence of \{IB\} increased after 5 and 6 months of \{CA\} storage. Fruit stored in 0.5 and 1% \{O2\} suffered higher incidence of \{IB\} than those stored in 1.5 and 2.0% O2. Symptoms of CA-induced \{IB\} are different from those of \{FB\} disorder, which resulted from prolonged air storage. The development of \{IB\} disorder was closely associated with an increase in \{PDC\} activity. Changes in ethylene production and \{FF\} during post-storage ripening at 20 °C were found to be the best objective measurements of storage life of ‘Doyenne du Comice’ fruit. Fruit stored in refrigerated air for 1–3 months exhibited typical climacteric-like patterns of ethylene production during 15 days at 20 °C and softened to proper ripeness with desirable eating quality on day 5 at 20 °C. The magnitude of ethylene production increased with storage time when initially transferred to temperature at 20 °C. Fruit stored in air for 4 months or longer did not exhibit climacteric-like patterns of ethylene production during ripening and softened improperly with coarse and dry texture. Fruit stored in either 1% O2/&lt;0.1% \{CO2\} or 2% O2/1% \{CO2\} for 3 months (short-term \{CA\} storage) followed by holding in air at −1 °C for 1, 2, and 3 months were capable of ripening normally with desirable dessert quality without developing any physiological disorders.

This disease is specific to green berries and leads to 60–80% harvest losses under conditions conducive to the development of the pathogen. Agricultural practices, combined with chemical control involving 8–12 annual fungicide applications, are known to be very effective against CBD, especially in high altitude regions (&gt;1600 m) where the most damaged coffee farms are found. Temperatures and rainfall may be key factors in the development of \{CBD\} epidemics. Therefore, an epidemiological study was conducted on smallholding coffee farms in Cameroon, to assess the dependence of disease development on variations in these climatic factors. Cross-correlations between disease severity and climatic parameters recorded weekly were estimated over two successive years (2004–2005), revealing a significant increase in disease severity in line with decreasing temperatures (minimum or maximum). They also indicated a large variation in disease severity depending on the number of raining days during berry growth. However, no significant correlation was found with the quantity of rainfall over the two years of observations. Thus, temperatures and rainfall distribution appear to be the key climatic parameters that favor the development of \{CBD\} epidemics. These results suggest that temperature and rainfall parameters might be very useful for establishing predictive models to optimize effective \{CBB\} control in areas with a high disease incidence. "

In the present study, a mathematical model for drying of food products undergoing shrinkage has been developed. The model, which includes the influence of both material and equipment, is capable of predicting dynamic behaviour of the dryer. Heat and mass transfer equations are solved simultaneously using a numerical technique. The material model is capable of predicting the instantaneous temperature and moisture distribution inside the material. The equipment model, on the other hand, describes the transfer process in the tunnel dryer and predicts the instantaneous temperature and humidity ratio of air at any location of the tunnel. For evaluation purposes, the model was applied to drying experiments in the range of air temperatures between 40 and 60 °C and air velocity between 0.3 and 0.7 m/s. A tunnel type fruits dryer was used to conduct experiments. The prediction of the average moisture content and material temperature compared favourably with the experimental results. The predicted air temperature and humidity ratio of a batch type tunnel dryer also agreed fairly well with the experimental results. The model is capable of predicting dynamic behaviour of drying of fruits undergoing shrinkage and, as such, it can be used as a design tool. A parametric study was also conducted to examine the effect of different operating variables on drying potential and drying time. "

Seven isolates of Alternaria spp. were characterized using morphological examination, genotypic analysis and pathogenicity. Six of these isolates produced conidiophores and conidia displaying sporulation patterns typical of the Alternaria alternata species-group. Variability in colony morphology and growth on different media was observed. Phylogenetic analysis of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences clustered all isolates within a monophyletic clade, while intergenic spacer region (IGS)-RFLP profiles were congruent with those of A. alternata and Alternaria arborescens. RAPD-PCR proved helpful in discriminating between strains. To assay strain pathogenicity, grape berries were infected while undergoing withering conditions at different temperatures. Disease capacity was found to be strain dependent and varied consistently between the most and least aggressive strains. This study has provided interesting information on polymorphism within Alternaria spp. populations in withered grapes and on understanding the saprophytic role of this fungus during the post-harvest dehydrating process.

abstract = "Cherimoya fruit (Annona cherimola, Mill.) were kept at 20°C in air or in 20% \{CO2\} for 3 days and then transferred to air, to study the effect of a high \{CO2\} treatment on phenolic metabolism and ripening-related changes. Total polyphenol levels remained constant while a rapid decline in lignin content was observed in cherimoyas stored in air. However, a sharp increase in \{PAL\} activity up to the second day at 20°C was observed. The maximum ethylene production was observed 2 days later. At the end of the \{CO2\} treatment, ethylene production was inhibited and \{PAL\} activity was similar to that found in air-treated fruit. These data suggest that the increase in \{PAL\} activity at 20°C was not affected by high \{CO2\} and does not relate to ethylene. The \{CO2\} treatment inhibited flesh softening and maintained lignin at levels found in freshly harvested fruit. Exposure to 20% \{CO2\} also improved internal colour and increased the non-tannin polyphenol fraction, but prevented the decline in the tannin fraction otherwise observed upon ripening in air. We concluded that high \{CO2\} treatment at 20°C did not enhance \{PAL\} activity and lignin deposition although treated fruits retained more lignin after transfer to air. The possible involvement of \{PAL\} activity in the supply of important metabolic compounds for early events of ripening will be discussed. "

Heat treatment significantly reduced firmness and decay incidence in fruits after 5-day storage at 5 °C and 7 days of shelf life at 20 °C, and induced a delay in the evolution of skin colour. Other main quality parameters, such as juice content, soluble solids, pH, titratable acidity and sensory quality were unaffected. It was demonstrated that hot water postharvest treatments may be implemented in the citrus industry to extend shelf-life of fruits. "

Fruits were stored for 14 days in semi-controlled conditions (temperature range 14.4–19.9 °C, relative humidity range 35–55%), while non-treated tomatoes stored under the same conditions were used as a control. Sensory evaluation of samples was performed by trained panel, and instrumental measurements of color and texture were also carried out. Both postharvest treatments were effective in preventing tomato fruit spoilage. Hot air treatment resulted in better quality of tomato fruits in terms of sensory properties after two weeks of storage, but the \{UV\} irradiation resulted in favorable effects in terms of extension of tomato shelf life because it led to delayed ripening of tomato.

Fruit treated with propylene at 20 °C at harvest produced ethylene with a lag period of 3 days, had concomitant 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) production, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase (ACC synthase) and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase (ACC oxidase) activities, and were ripe after 3–5 days while fruit not treated with propylene were not able to produce ethylene and ripen during the 9 days experiment. \{AS\} fruit softened faster during the first 60 days of storage. This effect was reduced in \{CA\} and \{ULO\} treatments. The soluble solids content (SSC) increased markedly during the first 60 days of storage and remained almost constant thereafter in all treatments.

When kiwifruit were placed at 20 °C, after 60, 120 or 180 days storage at 0 °C, there was an induction of ethylene production with no lag period in fruit from \{AS\} or CA, with or without propylene. There was some \{ACC\} content and \{ACC\} synthase activity after 60 days storage for all treatments, while \{ACC\} oxidase activity increased only upon rewarming of the fruit in \{AS\} or CA. Kiwifruit removed from ULO-storage showed drastically reduced capacity to produce ethylene mainly due to low \{ACC\} oxidase activity rather than reduced \{ACC\} production or \{ACC\} synthase activity. Respiration increased upon rewarming of the fruit in all treatments. With storage time, there was a decrease in the capacity of the warmed fruit to produce ethylene and \{CO2\} as well as in the activities of \{ACC\} synthase and \{ACC\} oxidase, mostly after 60 days storage.

We developed two new near infrared ray (NIR)-cutting nets that combine high visible light (VL) transmittance and strong absorption in the \{NIR\} region (700–2500 nm) to improve the sweetness of melon fruits harvested in mid-summer. The first type, NIR-cut net A, had a \{VL\} transmittance of 69.2% and a \{NIR\} absorbance of approximately 45%. The other type, NIR-cut net B, had a \{VL\} transmittance of 61.6% and a \{NIR\} absorbance of 55%. These NIR-cut nets decreased the temperature by approximately 9 °C compared to the control when using a metal halide lamp for artificial lightning in laboratory experiments. In greenhouse experiments, the air temperature of the control greenhouse reached 38 °C at noon on a sunny day in midsummer, while the temperature was 34 °C in the greenhouses shaded with NIR-cut nets in the same conditions. Thermal imaging indicated that our NIR-cut nets also reduced the leaf temperature of greenhouse-grown plants by approximately 5 °C on a sunny day in midsummer. The use of the NIR-cut nets during the fruit maturation period did not affect the size of fruits, while still increasing their sugar accumulation. The Brix values of fruits grown in greenhouses covered with NIR-cut net A or B were 13.8 and 14.0°, respectively, higher than that of control (13.4°). Sucrose concentration of fruits shaded with NIR-cut net A or was 81.3 mg l−1, significantly higher than that of the control (68.5 mg l−1), while it was 71.4 mg l−1 for fruits grown in the greenhouse shaded with NIR-cut net B. These results demonstrate that NIR-cut net A is a valuable tool for improving the sugar content of greenhouse-grown melon fruits in midsummer. "

A great amount literature was accumulated for this classical apple variety about the molecular mechanisms of individual gene or gene family transcript changes during ripening, yet few of them on the large scale at transcriptomic levels. The present study was designed to use RNA-Seq to compare expression profiles between commercial ripening and physiological ripening stages of apple fruit in order to provide a deeper whole view for understanding the molecular control of ‘Royal Gala’ fruit ripening on transcript level. 13.78 G and 12.28 G clean reads were obtained for the commercial ripening and physiological ripening stages apple fruit, respectively acquired and were blasted against the apple genome. 78,553 genes were expressed in ripening apple fruit and among them 860 genes were differentially expressed between the two maturity stages, with 199 up-regulated and 661 down-regulated. The enrichment of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in gene ontology (GO) pathways revealed that genes in 8 \{GO\} terms were more activated at physiological maturity stage. Meanwhile, \{KEGG\} enrichment showed that secondary metabolism contained more up-regulated \{DEGs\} at physiological maturity stage than at commercial maturity stage. Furthermore, genes working on ripening-related processes were examined. For transcription factors regulating ethylene biosynthesis such as \{ERFs\} and HBs, the expression levels were significantly different between the two samples. Regarding fruit firmness decline, expression variation happened to genes encoding enzymes involving in cell wall metabolism, such as polygalacturonase PG1, xyloglucan endotransglucosylase \{XTHs\} and EXP3, as well as cell wall structure protein gene FLA. In conclusion, the RNA-Seq data presents the global expression changes of ripening related transcripts in ‘Royal Gala’ apple and novel identified genes and/or transcription factors may provide new clues to illuminate this complicated event.

The present study aimed to determine how mango fruit adapted its functioning in terms of fruit water relations, epicarp characteristics and the antioxidant defence system in peel, to environmental conditions. The effect of contrasted temperature and light conditions was evaluated under natural solar radiation and temperature by comparing well-exposed and shaded fruit at three stages of fruit development. The sun-exposed and shaded peels of the two sides of the well-exposed fruit were also compared. Depending on fruit position within the canopy and on the side of a well-exposed fruit, the temperature gradient over a day affected fruit characteristics such as transpiration, as revealed by the water potential gradient as a function of the treatments, and led to a significant decrease in water conductance for well-exposed fruits compared to fruits within the canopy. Changes in cuticle thickness according to fruit position were consistent with those of fruit water conductance. Osmotic potential was also affected by climatic environment and harvest stage. Environmental conditions that induced water stress and greater light exposure, like on the sunny side of well-exposed fruit, increased the hydrogen peroxide, malondialdehyde and total and reduced ascorbate contents, as well as SOD, \{APX\} and \{MDHAR\} activities, regardless of the maturity stage. The lowest values were measured in the peel of the shaded fruit, that of the shaded side of well-exposed fruit being intermediate. Mango fruits exposed to water-stress-induced conditions during growth adapt their functioning by reducing their transpiration. Moreover, oxidative stress was limited as a consequence of the increase in antioxidant content and enzyme activities. This adaptive response of mango fruit to its climatic environment during growth could affect postharvest behaviour and quality. "

Biological factors involved in deterioration of fresh fruit quality include the rates of respiration, ethylene production and transpiration and fruit sensitivity to ethylene and also compositional changes that affect color, texture, flavor (taste and aroma) and nutritional quality. Several physiological disorders also reduce fruit quality postharvest. These are the result of products' responses to various environmental and physical stresses, including temperature (the most significant factor), relative humidity, ethylene, atmospheric composition (concentrations of oxygen, carbon dioxide and other gases), and light. Lastly, other biological factors such as disease and insect infestation can reduce fruit quality. There are many opportunities to reduce quality deterioration associated with biological factors by selecting genotypes that have lower respiration and ethylene production rates, less sensitivity to ethylene, slower softening rate, improved flavor quality, enhanced nutritional quality (vitamins, minerals, dietary fiber, and phytonutrients including carotenoids and phenolic compounds), reduced browning potential, decreased susceptibility to chilling injury, and/or increased resistance to postharvest decay-causing pathogens. This chapter describes some of the important biological and environmental factors that influence deterioration rates, therefore causing losses of tropical and subtropical fruits. The potential uses of biotechnological approaches for improving quality and postharvest life are also briefly discussed. "

abstract = "Tomato fruit (Lycopersicon esculentum cv. Belissimo) were harvested at three different stages of ripening, sliced and stored at five different temperatures. Red–green–blue (RGB) images of the slices were taken regularly during storage, using a image processing system. For constructing a model, each of these colour aspects was considered to be built up by a variable part that changes according to a first order reaction mechanism and a fixed part that is invariable under the circumstances under study. All three colour aspects of the tomato slices (R, G and B) decreased exponentially during storage. The parameters of the model were estimated using multiple-response multiple-variate non-linear regression analysis using R, G and B simultaneously as response variables and time, temperature and ripening stage of the fruit at harvest simultaneously as explaining variables. To combine the information on the behaviour of the colour aspects during the preharvest and the postharvest period at different temperatures, it was assumed that the process of change during ripening was the same whether the fruit ripened on the plant or off-vine. So, the initial value for all three colour aspects (Col0,R, Col0,G and Col0,B) during the postharvest experiments depended on the time the tomatoes were allowed to ripen on the plant. By using this fundamental approach to build the model and using all available data and information it became possible to describe and simulate the behaviour of the colour aspects of tomato slices as a function of the ripening stage and the applied storage temperature. Although the variance between replicates was high, the statistical analysis on the mean values of colour aspects over the replicates provided a percentage variance accounted for of 95%. The same model was validated with data of another experiment with another tomato cultivar (Durinta) over a larger range of maturity stages. "

Four \{ROP\} cDNA fragments, EjROP1.1, EjROP1.2, EjROP2 and EjROP3, were isolated from ‘Luoyangqing’ (LYQ) loquat fruit, and all of them shared over 80% nucleotide identity with known \{ROPs\} from other plants. Sequence analysis revealed that EjROP1.1, EjROP2 and EjROP3 might be functional while EjROP1.2, with mutated C-terminal resulted from a 65 bp deletion in the corresponding nucleotide sequence as compared with EjROP1.1, might be dominant-negative and consequently act as a negative regulator of \{ROP\} signal transduction. Increase in expression of EjROP1.1, EjROP2 and EjROP3 was observed during first 4 or 6 d of storage at 20 °C and was positively correlated with the increase in flesh firmness. Expression of EjROP1.2 was constantly low under 20 °C but was quickly, within 6 h, induced under 0 °C, and it increased by about 20 times within 24 h. The expression was induced under 5 °C as well but not so strong as that under 0 °C, and transfer of fruit from 5 °C to 0 °C re-stimulated the expression. The possible roles of EjROPs played during senescence and cold regulated lignification was discussed, and the simultaneous increase in the expression of three functional EjROPs and the negative regulator EjROP1.2 was suggested to be important for maintaining a \{ROP\} rheostat to protect cells from excessive lignification.

Storage is the most important operation during the marketing of fruit. All operations, including harvesting, pre- or postharvest treatments, packaging, transportation, and temperature and humidity management during handling influence the storage life of fruits. This chapter presents an overview of storage systems and various qualitative changes that occur to citrus fruits. Handling, storage facilities and marketing structures vary greatly among the citrus-producing countries. Compared with many subtropical fruits, citrus fruits have a relatively long postharvest life. Several storage systems have been tried and many of them are being commercially used. Storage techniques are continuously being improved to extend the storage life of these fruits. The increasing demand and higher production of citrus fruits has resulted in a greater emphasis on the design, construction, and management of storage houses. The common storage houses currently in use are an improved and expanded design of simple-framed storage houses. The improved design and installation of sophisticated equipment in refrigerated storage houses have enabled the long-term storage of large quantities of citrus fruits. Controlled-atmosphere (CA) storage is the latest innovation, but prohibitive costs deter its use. "

It is imperative that the treatment is effective against codling moth yet maintains the quality of treated apples. The present study explored the application of radio frequency (RF) energy in conjunction with conventional hot water treatment to develop feasible heat treatments. Treatment parameters were selected based on minimum time–temperature conditions required for 100% mortality of fifth-instar codling moth and apple quality. The treatments included preheating of infested or wholesome apples in warm water at 45 °C for 30 min. The preheated apples were then heated to 48 °C in a hydraulic fruit mover placed between two parallel plate electrodes in a 12 kW, 27.12 \{MHz\} pilot scale \{RF\} system. \{RF\} treated apples were transferred to a 48 °C hot water bath and held for 5, 10, 15 and 20 min before being hydro-cooled in ice water for 30 min.

Classical postharvest technologies involve applying stress conditions (cold, controlled atmosphere conditions, addition of chemicals) to extend storage and shelf-life. However, recent research has concerned itself with understanding the mechanisms by which abiotic stresses affect postharvest commodity quality. Thus, holistic approaches that incorporate the use of transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic platforms, complemented with biochemical analysis as well as phenotyping are being used to understand stress physiology and its complex regulation at the different levels of cellular control (e.g., epigenetic control, post-transcriptional, post-translational) in order to develop and improve current technological processes. This review aims to highlight key methodological points that need to be addressed for further understanding of key postharvest abiotic stresses (cold/heat, low oxygen/high carbon dioxide and dehydration) and to review research over the last ten years dedicated to understanding postharvest abiotic stresses.

Fruit were assessed for ripening and internal atmosphere composition at 0°C/90–95% \{RH\} (only for ‘Comice’) and at 20°C/60–70% \{RH\} (for all cultivars, after they achieved the chilling requirement to ripen). For all cultivars coated at harvest and ripening at 20°C, respiration rates, softening and colour change followed a Michaelis–Menten model when plotted against internal partial pressure of \{O2\} pO2i, while internal partial pressure of \{CO2\} (pCO2i) had virtually no explanatory power for these variables. This supports the notion that modification of pO2i rather than pCO2i is the principal means by which coating achieves its effects on ripening behaviour of pears during shelf life. Michaelis–Menten constant values (Km) for respiration and softening were lower than those for colour change for all cultivars at 20°C. This resulted in colour change being retarded by any level of depression in pO2i created by coating, while firmness was substantially reduced only at much lower pO2i during shelf life. Plots of pCO2i and respiration versus pO2i for fruit coated either pre-climacteric (at harvest) or entering the climacteric (after cold storage), indicated that ‘Comice’ and ‘Packham's’ were tolerant to hypoxia whereas, with ‘Bartlett’ and ‘Bosc’, tolerance reduced with advancing ripening, and the latter cultivar was the least tolerant of all four cultivars. During storage at 0°C of ‘Comice’, coatings had a more substantial effect in delaying softening than colour change; firmness retention seemed to be related to increase of pCO2i, while the limited suppression of colour change seemed to be related to small reductions of pO2i. Therefore, optimisation of surface coatings for pears must account for differences between cultivars and ripening stage at which fruit are coated, as well as the temperature at which the fruit are going to be held.

In this study, antagonistic bacterium B-6-1 strain was isolated from the surface of tomato and identified as Enterobacter cowanii based on morphological characteristics and physiological and biochemical features combined with sequence analysis of 16SrDNA and ropB gene and construction of dendrogram. Effects of different concentrations of antagonistic bacterium E. cowanii suspension on antifungal activity after tomato harvest were analyzed by mycelium growth rate method. Results revealed that antifungal activity was also enhanced with increasing concentrations of antagonistic bacterium; inhibitory rates of 1 × 105 colony-forming units (cfu)/mL antagonistic bacterial solution on Fusarium verticillioides, Alternaria tenuissima, and Botrytis cinerea were 46.31%, 67.48%, and 75.67%, respectively.

Because forchlorfenuron (CPPU)-treatment after full bloom can enlarge fruit size, and significantly increase the income of farmers, it has been extensively used. However, \{CPPU\} might also influence fruit sugar and acid content, and storage performance. This study analyzed the differences in volatile emissions between CPPU-treated and water-treated kiwifruits after two, four, six, or eight days of storage, and differential gene expression related to these compounds using high-throughput sequencing. The number of volatile compounds was relatively high at the first two days of storage for both treated and control fruits, decreased in the following days, and increased again, although less significantly in CPPU-treated than in control fruits. Aldehydes in the control and treated groups showed a trend of stability vs. down-regulation, alcohols or terpenes showed high-low-high vs. down-regulation, and esters showed up-regulation vs. high-low-high, respectively. Only 60.12–66.68% of the genes obtained were mapped and 3370 new genes were annotated. Genes related to terpene biosynthesis were enriched, and, in CPPU-treated fruits, several genes related to hormone signal transduction were found in aldehydes, alcohols, and terpenes biosynthetic pathways. Although \{CPPU\} might influence the expression of genes encoding the core complex proteins in photosynthesis, its relationship with terpene synthesis is still unclear. Our results provided resources for the genetic annotation of kiwifruits, and revealed the impact of \{CPPU\} on the metabolism of their volatile compounds, laying the theoretical foundation for investigating the use of molecular techniques to inhibit the CPPU-related reduction of fruit quality.

abstract = "Abstract The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of pesticide formulations and fruit growth stages on the Pre-harvest Interval Period (PHI). Results showed that pesticide formulations did not affect the initial deposit and dissipation rate. However, the fruit growth stage at the application time showed a significant effect on the above-mentioned parameters. Fruit diameter increases in one millimeter pesticide dissipation rates were reduced in −0.033 mg kg−1 day−1 (R2 = 0.87; p &lt; 0.001) for grapes and −0.014 mg kg−1 day−1 (R2 = 0.85; p &lt; 0.001) for apples. The relation between solar radiation, air humidity and temperature, and pesticide dissipation rates were dependent on fruit type. \{PHI\} could change according to the application time, because of the initial amount of pesticide deposit in the fruits and change in the dissipation rates. Because Maximum Residue Level are becoming more restrictive, it is more important to consider the fruit growth stage effects on pesticide when performing dissipation studies to define PHI. "

Respiration rate, ethylene production and incidence of physiological disorders and decay were determined. Olive oil quality was evaluated based on titratable acidity, peroxide value, \{K232\} and \{K270\} coefficients, and fatty acid composition. Decay incidence increased with storage temperature and duration but it was lower in black-ripe olives kept in 2 kPa \{O2\} than in those kept in air. Fruit decay after 4 weeks storage in 2 kPa \{O2\} was 9.2, 8.2, and 7.7% in olives kept at 0, 2.2, and 5°C, respectively. No visual chilling injury symptoms were observed in any of the storage treatments. Storage time and atmospheres had no significant effect on olive color but visual quality scores of olives stored in 2 kPa \{O2\} at 0°C were generally higher than other treatments. Ethylene production and respiration rates were considerably higher at 5°C than at 0 or 2.2°C and in air than 2 kPa O2. Fruit firmness declined markedly after 4 weeks storage in both the air and 2 kPa \{O2\} treatments, irrespective of storage temperature. There was no significant difference between the air and 2 kPa \{O2\} stored fruit. There were no significant differences in water and oil content among treatments. Oil obtained from olives stored at 0°C, was within the limit of `extra' virgin quality in terms of acidity, irrespective of storage atmosphere after 4 weeks storage, whereas oils extracted from olives stored at 2.2°C in air and 2 kPa \{O2\} and olives stored at 5°C in 2 kPa \{O2\} were qualified as `fine' virgin quality. \{K232\} and \{K270\} values were not surpassed in any of the treatments except oil obtained from olives stored at 20°C. Fatty acid composition was within the range required for `extra' virgin olive oil, except for slightly higher linolenic acid. In conclusion, black-ripe `Manzanillo' olives can be stored at 0–5°C in air or in 2 kPa \{O2\} for up to 4 weeks between harvesting and processing while maintaining fruit and oil quality. "

Initially, harvested fruit of the examined cultivars were segregated non-destructively at advanced and less pronounced maturity stages and qualitative traits, physiological parameters, phytochemical composition and antioxidant capacity were determined. ‘Big Top’ and ‘Royal Glory’ fruits were characterized by slower softening rate and less pronounced ripening-related alterations. The coupling of \{HPLC\} fingerprints, consisted of 7 phenolic compounds (chlorogenic, neochlorogenic acid, catechin, epicatechin, rutin, quecetin-3-O-glucoside, procyanidin B1) and spectrophotometric methods disclosed a great impact of genotype on peach bioactive composition, with ‘Sun Cloud’ generally displaying the highest contents. Maturity stage at harvest did not seem to affect fruit phenolic composition and no general guidelines for the impact of cold storage and shelf-life on individual phenolic compounds can be extrapolated. Subsequently, fruit of less pronounced maturity at harvest were used for further molecular analysis. ‘Sun Cloud’ was proven efficient in protecting plasmid pBR322 \{DNA\} against \{ROO\} attack throughout the experimental period and against \{HO\} attack after 2 and 4 weeks of cold storage. Interestingly, a general down-regulation of key genes implicated in the antioxidant apparatus with the prolongation of storage period was recorded; this was more evident for CAT, cAPX, Cu/ZnSOD2, perAPX3 and \{GPX8\} genes. Higher antioxidant capacity of ‘Sun Cloud’ fruit could potentially be linked with compounds other than enzymatic antioxidants that further regulate peach fruit ripening. "

The greenest and firmest fruit were found in microperforated polybags compared with no polybags or commercial polybags when stored at 1°C, but overall loss of internal fruit condition occurred in all treatments at this temperature. At 3°C, fruit were less green and firm, although fruit kept in microperforated polybags were consistently greener than fruit without polybags or in commercial polybags. The benefit of using microperforated polybags declined with increasing storage period. The incidence of superficial scald, particularly in early harvested fruit, is a major limitation to the use of microperforated polybags for long-term storage. The results indicate that the potential for commercial use of microperforated polybags is limited to short-term storage. "

However, under pearl nets cv. AlfaV showed higher fruit mass, firmness and moderately higher bioactive compounds. Cultivar \{SCX\} 248 fruits under red nets were moderate in size, firmness, and bioactive compounds in comparison to the other nets. Cv. Irit fruit under all net types were small, less firm, low SSC, higher in \{TA\} while the black nets increased their bioactive compounds. Significant correlations were observed between bioactive compounds and the air temperature and photosynthetic active radiation. Cultivar AlfaV grown under the red net showed higher number of odour active aroma compounds in fruit while yellow nets significantly affected the synthesis of odour active aroma compounds. Pearl and red photo-selective nets improved the overall fruit quality; fruit mass, fruit firmness and bioactive components in cv.

Losses in developing countries along the tropical belt are estimated to be about 50%. Typical losses of underutilized fruits, such as Safou in central Africa, range from 40 to 50%. In Costa Rica, mango losses due to anthracnose in the central distribution market may range from 14% in the dry season to 84% during the rainy season. High temperatures during postharvest storage are commonly associated with high transpiration rates and subsequent degradation of quality traits. However, in the case of herbs such as marjoram even temperatures as high as 30 °C do not affect oil accumulation, but rather can stimulate synthesis. Temperatures and light intensity in tropical areas fluctuate less than in hot, dry, or temperate climates; although it is not completely clear how the low daily temperature fluctuation impacts the postharvest quality of fruit. Quality of crops and tree fruits harvested in late spring or early fall may often be challenged by high temperature in the desert. Herbs in particular suffer great weight loss when conditions at harvest include high temperatures. "

Microbial quality is microorganism-dependent, and is highly affected by chemical, physical, and biological factors pertaining to the cultivar and the environment. It is highly dependent on the conditions of cultivation, harvesting, handling, transport, and postharvest storage, as well as marketing conditions. Physical factors affecting growth and metabolic activity of microorganisms include temperature, pH, atmosphere, and moisture content. Chemical factors include the availability of nutrients and trace elements necessary for microbial growth, while biological factors include the presence of competing flora and interactions with the plant. There are various ways in which fruits and vegetables might become colonized by microbial flora, which could cause postharvest spoilage. Perhaps the most common route is the field's colonization by soil saprophytes and plant parasites. However, microbial colonization could result from contaminated seeds, as well as via contact with other fruits and vegetables at any stage during harvest and postharvest, including handling, transportation, processing, and packaging. Microbial biota could spread not only by direct contact, but also through air and water. For example, washing produce in a water tank might share microorganisms within the entire lot. "

The respiration rate and mechanical properties (compression load, strain and apparent elasticity modulus) of the peach fruit during storage at room temperature, as a function of its maturity stage (green, middle yellow and yellow) were also evaluated. Middle yellow fruits exhibited higher respiration rate than those corresponding to green and yellow ones. The peach fruit tissue showed anisotropic behavior, varying its mechanical properties with the orientation (tangential or radial) of the compressive load. The mechanical properties of peach exhibited a strong dependence on the degree of maturity at harvest and the rate of senescence progression. "

A computer-based diagnosis tool requiring a limited number of measurements was developed and used to characterise the typology of soil water deficit experienced by grapevine in field sites over the cropping season with the aim of producing acceptable yields and achieving good quality red wine. The tool combined a simple soil water balance model parameterised for vine, to simulate the fraction of transpirable soil water (FTSW) at a daily time step, and an indicator of vine water status in terms of source/sink relationships and canopy microclimate. This indicator was developed from quantitative relationships between \{FTSW\} and maximal net assimilation (Anmax), under optimal conditions of light and temperature, the leaf emergence rate on first-order lateral branches (LER I), the leaf emergence rate on second-order lateral branches (LER II) and the final length of first-order lateral branches (BL I). These relationships were parameterised in a greenhouse on Syrah (syn. Shiraz) grafted onto Fercal rootstock. The computer-based diagnosis tool was used on 24 fields within 4 vineyards of Mediterranean southern France covering contrasting pedoclimatic conditions, cultivar/rootstock pairs and receiving different water regimes. The key soil parameter of the water balance model, the total vine's transpirable soil water (TTSW), was estimated in each field from measurements of predawn leaf water potential (Ψl) at different vine growth stages in conjunction with an optimisation algorithm of the simulated \{FTSW\} as a function of predawn Ψl obtained with an independent data set. The tool enabled classification of the fields on the basis of the changes of the indicator of vine water status across four phases of the plant cycle, from budburst to harvest, relative to an optimum change of this indicator defined for production of a good quality wine. Such a tool will be useful to farm advisers and researchers for the evaluation of management practices as for comparative analysis between vineyards. "

Additionally, fruits were stored at 1 °C for 1, 2 or 3 weeks and were then subjected to a post cold storage at 25 °C for up to 48 h. Short-term anaerobic and pure oxygen storage decreased the browning index and relative abundance of the \{ATP\} synthase β subunit (LcAtpB) and increased respiration intensity, \{ATP\} content, the contribution of an alternate oxidation pathway to the total respiration (ρVAP/Vt) and the transcription of plant uncoupling mitochondria protein 1 (LcUCP1), with short-term anaerobic treatment being more significant than pure oxygen. Cold storage decreased the \{ATP\} levels but increased the browning index, respiration intensity, ρVAP/Vt and the transcription of alternative oxidase 1 (LcAOX1), LcUCP1, ADP/ATP carrier 1 (LcAAC1) and sucrose non-fermenting-1-related kinase 2 (LcSnRK2) during the post storage shelf-life at 25 °C.

Plant height, leaf number, leaf area and dry weight of aerial plant parts were significantly increased with increasing levels of supplementary light. Greater early yield and market value was found with increasing levels of supplementary light prior to planting, due to an increased number of harvested fruit in the early cropping period. The increased yield and market value was maintained throughout the 16 week harvest period. A reduction in fruit quality with increasing levels of supplementary light was found in the early cropping period but no differences were found after 16 weeks of harvest. No significant interactions with temperature or cultivar were found. "

abstract = "Abstract The immature non-climacteric fruit of zucchini is very sensitive to postharvest chilling injury (PCI). Although the fruit produces very low ethylene at harvest, cold storage induces an increase in ethylene production in the refrigerated fruit, and upon rewarming up to room temperature. The production of ethylene after rewarming was proportional to cold damage and found to be higher in the fruit of the cultivars most susceptible to chilling. The effects of the ethylene inhibitor 1-methycyclopropene (1-MCP) has been analyzed using the postharvest quality parameters of nine zucchini cultivars stored at 20 °C and 4 °C for 14 days. We have also determined the evolution of ethylene production in the fruit of these cultivars, and assessed the expression profiles of twelve ethylene biosynthesis and signaling genes in both control fruit and in 1-MCP treated fruit, of two cultivars that responded to 1-MCP. The 1-MCP treatment reduced the rate and delayed the onset of \{PCI\} symptoms and reduced fruit weight loss, although only in the fruit of the most chilling-susceptible cultivars, and concomitantly we found a reduction in the respiration rate and in the level of cold-induced ethylene. This data suggests that ethylene is not only a response of the fruit to cold damage, as occurs upon rewarming, but could also play a regulation role in the onset of \{PCI\} in this non-climacteric fruit. The genes CpACO1 and CpACS1 were found to be involved in the biosynthesis of the cold-induced ethylene, but the role played by CpACO1 was found to be the key function, since it was induced higher than CpACS1 in response to cold storage. More over CpACO1 was the only ethylene biosynthesis gene that was downregulated by the 1-MCP treatment. Some of the ethylene perception and signaling genes, including CpETR1, CpCTR1 and CpEIN3.1 were also induced in response to cold storage, and were downregulated in response to 1-MCP, indicating that the positive effect of 1-MCP in the fruit of certain zucchini cultivars is also associated with a downregulation of genes involved in ethylene perception and signal transduction pathways.

There is a need for an effective means to systematically develop and assess heat treatments to save time and expense. In this study, we developed a cumulated lethal time model based on the efficacy of different hot water treatments for killing codling moth in cherries. Minimum temperature–time combinations to achieve complete kill of codling moth larvae in cherries were determined and compared with the prediction of the cumulated lethal time model. In experiments to validate the model, larval mortality of the codling moth, Cydia pomonella (L.) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), was evaluated in infested cherries subjected to various periods of temperatures in warm water baths. This model calculates the accumulative lethal effect of the complete process by using measured temperature–time data in the core of cherries along with established intrinsic thermal death kinetics information on the target insects. This model predicted minimum treatment times to achieve a total mortality of the pest population in cherries for different treatment temperatures. The results show that this model can be used to predict the thermal mortality of the insects in fruit for any pattern of heat treatment, provided that the temperature–time profile in the infested fruits is measured. This procedure should allow for rapid efficacy comparisons in a range of thermal treatments against codling moth larvae in different commodities. "

abstract = "Abstract Lowering the temperature set point for heating is an important method of reducing energy consumption, and hence carbon dioxide emissions, in greenhouse tomato production. Nonetheless, this measure is rarely applied in Central European and North American greenhouses due to the high value of the product, worries about a decline in yield and quality, and the prices of fossil fuels, which continue to be relatively moderate. Temperature decreases can only be introduced successfully if the constraints of ecological and economic feasibility involved are known. To this end, two experiments were conducted in which tomato plants were cultivated at day and night heating set points of 20/18, 16/14 and 11/9 °C, respectively. In all of the treatments, the set points for opening the ventilation were an air temperature of 27 °C and 80% relative air humidity. Crop photosynthesis appeared to be unaffected by the temperature set point for heating, although the concentrations of leaf soluble sugar and starch increased significantly at low temperatures compared to at high temperatures. The reduction in the temperature set points also appeared to have no impact on the total production of dry matter, the dry matter fraction allocated to the fruit and, thus, the total fruit yield. However, each one Kelvin reduction in temperature resulted in a 3.5-day increase in the time required for fruit to develop and, thus, in a considerable delay of the first harvest. This delay was balanced out by higher yields generated in later harvests. The temperature of the fruit itself rather than that of the complete plant was responsible for this delay. Surprisingly, the reduction in temperature had little effect on the quality of the fruit: the mass of single fruits increased significantly as temperature decreased. However, there was no effect on the fruit reducing sugar content, and only a slight decrease in fruit titratable acid content. From an ecological perspective, carbon dioxide emissions caused by tomato production can be cut considerably by reducing the heating set points without affecting yield and only having a slight effect on the quality of the fruit. From an economic perspective, any loss of profit due to the delay of harvests would have to be balanced out by the savings generating by turning down the heating. "

Juice exudation from the cracks resulted in a wet and sticky berry skin. Hairline cracks, which we propose to term ‘hairline’, were distinctively different from splitting observed before harvest. Hairline was only induced when table grapes were treated with gaseous SO2, commonly used to prevent decay of table grapes during cold storage in Chile. In practice, conditions that favored higher concentrations of SO2, such as the use of two \{SO2\} generating pads (one on top and one on the bottom of the packaged table grapes), promoted hairline cracking. Hairline incidence increased linearly when the concentration and time product (CT) of \{SO2\} exceeded 3 (mL L−1) h, and no hairline cracking was observed with \{CT\} below 0.8 (mL L−1) h. Hairline symptoms were greatly induced on Thompson Seedless table grapes that were immersed in acidic solutions (citric acid and disodium phosphate) at pH 2 or 4. To reduce this disorder, it is essential to use a minimal dose of \{SO2\} that allows adequate protection from decay without reducing the berry quality. Postharvest practices of table grapes, packaged with a \{SO2\} generating pad, such as extended delay cooling periods and those practices that involve a raise in temperature, considerably enhance this disorder. Hairline cracking is another expression of phytotoxicity due to overexposure of table grapes to SO2. "

After harvest, free putrescine levels decreased during storage at 20 °C, whereas in fruit kept at 4 °C this polyamine accumulated in both varieties, but with higher levels in the sensitive variety (Sinatra). This behavior suggests that putrescine is accumulated as a response to low temperature in zucchini fruit by stress-induced chilling injury, and not due to the postharvest storage itself. \{ADC\} activity responds quickly to chilling but sharply decreases after 14 days, whereas its expression remains high in both varieties. \{ODC\} activity takes over when the cold stress is relatively severe, as this activity was found to be much higher in Sinatra. \{ODCexpression\} also correlated with \{ODC\} activity. \{DAO\} activity increased in Natura fruit, and conversely decreased in Sinatra fruit during storage at 4 °C, whereas the proline content was higher in Natura and lower in Sinatra. Therefore, we suggest that putrescine degradation and proline accumulation contribute to the acquisition of chilling tolerance in zucchini fruit. \{GABA\} content decreased in both varieties, with a greater reduction in Natura fruit and less in Sinatra fruit. In addition, \{GABA\} transaminase showed a higher activity in Natura fruit than in Sinatra fruit during cold storage, suggesting that \{GABA\} catabolism could be involved in the tolerance to postharvest cold storage in zucchini fruit.

abstract = "‘Benitaka’ is one of the most important colored table grapes grown in Brazil. However, the lack of a pink and uniform color of berry skins is frequently observed when this cultivar is grown in warm climates, where high temperatures may inhibit anthocyanin accumulation. The endogenous plant growth regulator, abscisic acid (S-ABA), the concentration of which increases in grape berry skins at the onset of maturation (veraison), seems to be involved in the regulation of anthocyanin accumulation. Recently, an efficient S-ABA production method was developed so that it could be used on crops, which led to the evaluation of different concentrations applied at or around veraison to colored table grapes. Thus, a trial was carried out during two consecutive seasons in a commercial vineyard of ‘Benitaka’ table grape trained on an overhead trellis system, located at Marialva, Paraná state, Brazil. A randomized complete-block design was used with vines as blocks and clusters as experimental units, with four replications and eight treatments, as follows: (a) control; (b) S-ABA 200 mg/L applied 7 days after veraison (DAV); (c) S-ABA 400 mg/L 7 DAV; (d) S-ABA 200 mg/L 15 days before harvest (DBH); (e) S-ABA 400 mg/L 15 DBH; (f) S-ABA 200 mg/L 7 \{DAV\} + 200 mg/L 15 DBH; (g) S-ABA 400 mg/L 7 \{DAV\} + 400 mg/L 15 DBH; (h) ethephon 500 mg/L 7 DAV. In both seasons, S-ABA improved the color of ‘Benitaka’ grapes, especially when it was applied twice, i.e., 400 mg/L 7 days after veraison and 400 mg/L 15 days before harvest. Regardless of the concentrations or application timing, there is no alteration in the berries and clusters physical characteristics. "

The principal aim of this study was to investigate the effect of 1-MCP and \{CA\} on fruit quality, including physiological disorders, and oxidative stress metabolites in stored ‘Cold Snap’ and ‘Swiss Bartlett’ pears. Freshly harvested pears were treated with or without 1-MCP, and then stored at 0 °C under refrigerated air or \{CA\} (18 kPa or 2.5 kPa O2, and 2 kPa CO2) for at least 167 d. 1-MCP and \{CA\} delayed and/or reduced the rates of ethylene production in stored fruit of both cultivars. 1-MCP and \{CA\} delayed fruit softening and peel yellowing in ‘Swiss Bartlett’ pears, but had negligible to slight effects with ‘Cold Snap’. In both cultivars, high incidences of senescent scald and internal breakdown occurred in non-1-MCP-treated pears during refrigerated air storage. For the most part these symptoms were reduced by \{CA\} and 1-MCP, resulting in minimal to negligible incidence in 1-MCP-treated pears stored at 2.5 kPa O2. γ-Aminobutyrate accumulated in stored pears, although 1-MCP and \{CA\} slightly reduced the levels in ‘Cold Snap’ fruit and 1-MCP increased levels in ‘Swiss Bartlett’ fruit. Ascorbate (total and reduced) levels were rapidly depleted in ‘Cold Snap’ fruit, regardless of treatment; these levels were better maintained in 1-MCP-treated ‘Swiss Bartlett’ fruit than control fruit across all storage atmospheres. In both cultivars, glutathione (total and reduced) concentrations and redox status fluctuated during storage, although these levels were generally higher in 1-MCP-treated fruit. Moreover, glutathione depletion occurred in advance of the development of senescence disorders in stored pear fruit. "

The effect of wounding and pathogen inoculation on lignin content was also quantified. At 20 °C, less decay incidence and severity were observed when time between wounding and inoculation increased, and these differences were more important in fruit from immature and commercial harvests. However, at 0 °C, wound response was too slow to prevent P. expansum infection. Lignin content was highest in fruit from the immature harvest. Our results indicated that maturity and storage temperature play an important role in apple wound response.

Several parameters including respiration rate, ethylene production and total titratable acidity were analyzed. The polyamine prevailing after harvest was spermidine, although a sharp increase was observed in putrescine content during ripening. The possible relationship between this rise in putrescine level and the ripening process was studied on the basis of the pattern of diamine content in fruit stored over a range of low temperatures (10, 8 and 6 °C). Retardation of the ripening process by cold storage was concurrent with a slower rate of increase in the free putrescine level. Moreover, where ripening was inhibited by storage at the chilling temperature (6 °C), no increase in free putrescine was observed. While no variation was observed in spermidine and spermine content in fruit ripening at 20 °C, levels did undergo change during low temperature storage. The possibility that significant accumulation of the free putrescine titer may be associated with high acidity levels in ripening cherimoya tissues is discussed. "

Effective and non-effective yeast isolates were applied near the young hyphal growth. Samples were taken 24 h later from the area where the fungi and yeast had intersected. Light microscopy revealed a general attachment of the effective biocontrol agent P. guilliermondii (isolate 87) and a non-effective isolate (117) of Debaryomyces hansenii. Low temperature scanning electron microscopy (LTSEM) indicated that both species of yeast attached to the fungal hyphae, but the 87 isolate attached fastidiously. Twenty-four hours after applying the 87 isolate to B. cinerea, pitting and collapse of the hyphae were observed. These observations were confirmed using transmission electron microscopy. These features were not observed with the ineffective isolate of D. hansenii. Further experiments indicated that attachment of P. guilliermondii to hyphae of B. cinerea could be blocked by agents that alter protein integrity (salts, proteases, etc.) and certain sugars. Isolates of both species produced β-(1–3) glucanase when cultured in various carbon sources and on cell walls of fruit rotting pathogens. Culture supernatants from P. guilliermondii, however, yielded two- to five-fold more β-(1–3) glucanase activity compared with D. hansenii. Data indicate that tenacious attachment, along with secretion of cell wall degrading enzymes, may play a role in the biocontrol activity of this yeast antagonist. "

abstract = "Abstract Calcium (Ca2+) and 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP) appear to have opposite effects on the development of bitter pit. However, both post-harvest treatments seem capable of influencing fruit ripening, reducing superficial scald and improving post-storage quality. The objective of this work was to investigate the effect of calcium chloride and 1-MCP alone or combined on the incidence and development of physiological disorders and the delay of ripening of apples during storage (at 0.5 °C in air) and subsequent shelf-life at room temperature ≈22 °C. ‘Golden Delicious’ apples were harvested in 10 orchards and treated with calcium chloride (1.5%, w/v), 1-MCP (625 nL L−1), calcium chloride plus 1-MCP, and without any treatment (control). Physiological disorders and quality parameters were evaluated at harvest and after 6 months storage as well as after 7 d shelf-life. The 1-MCP treatment was effective to prevent superficial scald, slow softening, increase soluble solids content and reduce electrolyte leakage and color changes associated with ripening, during storage and shelf-life. However, this treatment also enhanced the development of bitter pit, especially the moderate and severe symptoms in some orchards, which may be attributable to orchard cultivation techniques. CaCl2 alone and CaCl2 plus 1-MCP reduced bitter pit intensity by reducing moderate and severe incidence, maintained higher lightness and had firmer fruit than control. Postharvest dips of ‘Golden Delicious’ apples in CaCl2 before 1-MCP application (CA + MCP), may be a good solution to prevent scald, and reducing the bitter pit which is enhanced by 1-MCP alone. "

To gather the required information to develop these models batches of 20 tomatoes (cv. Tradiro), each harvested at two maturity stages, were stored at four different temperatures (3, 12, 20 and 25 °C) up to four weeks. One temperature (3 °C) is known to cause chilling injury to the product. During storage at these temperatures firmness loss, moisture loss and near infrared spectra were measured on individual tomatoes at regular intervals. The decrease in firmness was measured non-destructively by flat-plate compression, moisture loss was measured by weight loss. The information on firmness and moisture loss was used to develop two types of models. The first type of model was based on fundamental laws of chemical kinetics, assuming plausible chemical reaction mechanisms. These reaction mechanisms describe the processes underlying either firmness, or moisture loss. From these reaction mechanisms a set of differential equations was derived and solved at constant temperature. For these kinetic models, both for firmness, and moisture loss, two independent processes were assumed. One process is mainly expressed at low (&lt;10 °C) temperatures and relates to chilling injury; its contribution increases at decreasing temperatures. The other process relates to the normally observed fruit softening and moisture loss process during storage. Throughout the entire temperature range its contribution increases at increasing temperature. The second type of model was based on Partial Least Squares Regression analysis, relating the data on firmness to the near infrared spectral data. Due to their difference in nature the kinetic models describe the firmness change and moisture loss in time at constant external condition. The regression model describes the actual firmness of a homogeneous batch of tomatoes. "

Methods Microfungi contaminating berries during the vegetative period of year 2008 and 2009 in vineyards regions of Slovakia at the early veraison and at the ripening in harvest time have been identified. Results Spoilage fungi were more abundant in veraison for both years in all the studied geographical regions, with an average temperature of 20 °C, humidity between 60 and 80%, and precipitation in the range 6–5 mm. Much more strains of toxigenic fungi were found during veraison and ripening in the case of a year temperature variation in the range 17–22.5 °C, humidity values ranging from 58 to 80% and precipitations in the range 0.7–8.4 mm.

Finding complementary treatments minimizing deterioration and reducing postharvest losses would be extremely useful. In this work we evaluated the effect of postharvest cytokinin (CK) treatments on refrigerated round soft rind squash. Fruit were harvested at commercial maturity and sprayed with 1 mmol L−1 benzylaminopurine (BAP) or water (control) prior to storage at 5 °C for 0, 13 or 25 days. Quality was assessed upon removal from cold storage as well as after a 2 day shelf-life period at 20 °C. CK-treated fruit showed slower deterioration and dehydration and remained firmer than the control. \{BAP\} sprays did not affect color, respiration or sugar-acid balance. The treatments prevented phenolic compound accumulation, and decreased pectin solubilization. By the end of the storage period BAP-treated squash had higher levels (45%) of tightly-bound polyuronides than untreated controls, indicating a substantial delay in cell wall dismantling. \{CK\} sprays also reduced neutral sugar solubilization from pectin-rich fractions, but no changes were found in the cross-linking glycans or cellulose. To our knowledge, this is the first work showing that \{CK\} can regulate pectin disassembly in developing fruit. Postharvest \{BAP\} sprays preventing texture deterioration may be a simple treatment to complement refrigeration of round, soft rind, summer squash. "

abstract = "Publisher Summary Stress is usually categorized by environmental (abiotic) factors or biological (biotic) factors that induce injury and quality degradation. Fruits and vegetables are exposed to several types of stress as they pass through the handling system from farm to consumer. Some types of stress are induced intentionally, such as temperature change and controlled atmosphere use, while others are unintentional, such as impact stress during harvest and handling. Stresses, which the product experiences in the field or orchard, can manifest in damage, once the product has been harvested. The category of stress evident after harvest includes stress from direct sunlight, mineral deficiency, and latent infections of pathogens that invade during the development of a fruit or vegetable and are quiescent until after the product is harvested. Postharvest fungal pathogens exploit three main routes to penetrate the host tissue: through wounds occurring during growth, through natural openings such as lenticels and stem ends, and by direct breaching of the cuticle of the commodity. In many cases a fungus will enter the unripe fruit tissue and then remain inactive until the harvested fruit ripens. The penetration may go unnoticed by the fruit, or may elicit rapid defense processes that can limit fungal development. The period from infection to activation of fungal development and symptom expression is called the quiescent stage. After harvest and during ripening, the mechanisms that protect unripe fruit from fungal development become nonfunctional, and the quiescent fungus begins to develop and cause decay. "

Zucchini fruit is susceptible to develop chilling injury when stored at low temperature. In this study, the effects of putrescine, spermidine and spermine treatment (1 mM) on the physiological behavior of zucchini fruit during cold storage were investigated, focusing on the changes in polyamine metabolism and in alterations of polyamine-related nitrogen metabolites and hormones. Among the polyamines used, exogenous application of putrescine was found to be the best treatment to improve postharvest cold tolerance. Treated fruit were of better quality, and in general after cold storage they showed reduced weight loss, chilling injury, and malondialdehyde and hydrogen peroxide contents. Putrescine treatment induced betaine and proline accumulation, fatty acid desaturase expression, and also changes in the biochemical \{GABA\} shunt pathway during cold storage. These responses may contribute to increased energy production in fruit treated with putrescine. In general, the putrescine treatment induced different pathways that are considered stress defense mechanisms, and we hypothesize that they could contribute to improve postharvest quality of zucchini fruit after storage at 4 °C.

In this study a degradative metabolism of flavonoids (flavanones, flavones and polymethoxyflavones) was observed when ‘Fortune’ mandarin, Citrus limon and Citrus paradisi, fruits were inoculated with Alternaria alternata, a pre-harvest pathogenic fungus. Associated to this flavonic metabolism the de novo synthesis of the phytoalexin scoparone was detected. This metabolism of flavonoids is caused by an extracellular fungus laccase. The kinetic characterisation of this enzyme revealed that the activity was induced by Citrus flavonoids and was dependent on flavonoid concentrations. The enzyme exhibited a Km of 1.9 mM using \{ABTS\} as substrate with an optimum pH of 3.5 in citrate buffer 100 mM. The enzyme is active between 15 and 45 °C, the optimum temperature being around 35 °C, although 50% of the initial activity is lost after 45 min at 35 °C. The A. alternata laccase was inhibited by 0.5 mM l-cysteine and by caffeic acid. Study of the substrate specificity of this enzyme revealed that Citrus flavonoids are substrates of A. alternata laccase. These results suggest that the laccase enzyme could be involved in the pathogenesis of A. alternata in Citrus. "

Pollen is harvested from male trees and mechanically applied to inflorescences on female trees. An overly high rate of fruit set may cause excessive fruit load, requiring expensive fruit thinning to prevent reduction in fruit size and marketability. On the other hand, inefficient pollination results in lower yield. Although the female flower has three separate carpels, only one develops into a fruit; the others degenerate. Non-fertilized flowers may develop into parthenocarpic singlet or triplet fruit, which have no commercial value. Environmental conditions affect fertilization and fruit development. The current study characterizes fertilization and early fruit development in date palm under different temperature conditions. The date palm is a very large tree. To study environmental effects on its reproductive biology, special units, termed “modular phytotrons”, were designed for this research. They were assembled on pollinated inflorescences of whole ‘Medjoul’ date trees in the orchard, enabling modification of temperature regimes in planta. Pollen-tube growth, fertilization, fruitlet formation and carpel degeneration, as well as early development of parthenocarpic fruit were defined and characterized by macro- and microscopic analyses. Relatively low temperatures applied during plant fertilization significantly decreased pollen germination rate, enhanced formation of parthenocarpic fruit and reduced normal fruit development. The significance of these results to horticultural practices during fertilization and fruit thinning is discussed. "

Chill was examined using four chill models; the 0–7.2 °C, Modified Utah, Positive Utah and Dynamic models. Differences between locations were found with notable recent declines at Orange, Lenswood, Tatura, Yarra Valley and Bacchus Marsh. Other locations have remained stable with no location exhibiting a consensus increase in chill across all models. Trends in chill were shown to differ between models with results indicating that the 0–7.2 °C model frequently behaved differently to the other three chill models.

Sunburn, granulation, and fruit cracking are preharvest disorders related to climate and management practices during fruit growth in orchards. If fruits with sunburn injuries or granulation are stored, they deteriorate rapidly. Granulation and regreening generally take place because of a delay in harvesting. Other physiological disorders caused by preharvest factors include boron and copper deficiency, zebra skin, and water spotting. The postharvest development of disorders depends on management of temperature, humidity, and handling practices. Injuries and disorders on the surface and inside the fruit are manifested slowly, as in the case of chilling injury, oleocellosis, and rind breakdown. Most disorders appearing on the surface of various citrus fruits are related to the rupture of oil glands, phytotoxic injury to tissues, and subsequent water loss.

UV-C treatment reduced both the incidence and severity of banana fruits stored under low temperature. UV-C treatment reduced membrane damage indicated by lower activity of lipoxygenase (LOX) and malondialdehyde (MDA) content. In additions, the in vitro polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity was activated when fruits were stored at \{CI\} temperature and UV-C treatment could inhibit the \{PPO\} activity. UV-C treatment also delayed yellowing and chlorophyll (Chl) degradation due to the inhibition of chlorophyllase and chl-degrading peroxidase activities. Furthermore, the reduction of ethylene production and respiration rate by UV-C treatment results in extended postharvest shelf life of banana. These finding suggest that the loss of cellular compartments in consequence of membrane degradation, combined with the increase of \{PPO\} activity, might contribute to the development of \{CI\} in banana peel. UV-C treatment may play an important role in maintained membrane integrity and inhibited \{PPO\} activity, reducing the severity of \{CI\} symptom and delayed ripening in banana.

Thus, this research aimed to characterize the quality of Elsanta strawberries samples, harvested at altitudes ranging from 900 to 1.500 m above sea level, during two consecutive years (2011 and 2012). Strawberry samples were collected once from the four cultivation sites located at 900 m, 1.100 m, 1.200 m and 1.500 m above sea level in each year, when the yield per pick was the highest. Anthocyanins concentration correlated negatively with the increase of altitude in both years (R = −0.55; p ≤ 0,01). Consistently, the strawberry antioxidant potential, measured with an electrochemical method, was lower in fruits grown at higher altitude (36% less when fruits from 900 and 1.500 m asl were compared). Strawberries collected at 1.500 m asl presented an higher average fruit weight, whereas other physico-chemical parameters such as soluble solids and titratable acidity did not change according to the altitude. This research consistently confirm the role of altitude as effective factor on the phenolic synthesis and final accumulation in strawberry fruits, as well as on their antioxidant activity. "

Fruit shelf life can be prolonged by lowering the storage temperature to a level tolerated by the individual fruit species/variety without impairing quality. Some citrus fruits are, however, susceptible to chilling or cold injury and therefore should be stored for a short duration at low temperatures. One promising area is the use of ionizing radiation for disinfection and disinfestations of fruit. This chapter discusses the response of citrus fruits to irradiation. The irradiation process has two requirements: a source of radiant energy and a way to confine that energy while applying it. The response of a citrus fruit to radiation depends on the amount of radiation absorbed. There are advantages as well as limitations of the use of irradiation technology in fresh citrus fruit handling. It has a potential for use as a fruit-fly disinfestation and disease-management tool, depending on the fruit species' tolerance of doses. Fruit conditioning and other treatments combined with irradiation prove helpful in reducing deleterious effects of irradiation. However, lemons, limes, and oranges offer no promise for commercial irradiation. Alternative, cheaper, non-injurious, and more effective procedures are available. Further, irradiation dosages required to retard decay result in the rind breakdown, impair sensory qualities, and effect many changes in normal metabolism. Therefore, irradiation cannot be a substitute for refrigeration and at best can only supplement it. "

abstract = "Publisher Summary This chapter highlights the challenges in postharvest handling that affect consumer acceptability. The challenges include stress physiology, quality management, marketing, and food safety. Almost any handling technique used to keep harvested crops fresh for an extended period of time causes some stress to that tissue. Temperature extremes, desiccation, microbial invasion, gaseous atmosphere, light, and mechanical handling can all induce stress in a harvested fruit or vegetable. Certain fruits and vegetables are susceptible to disorders, such as chilling, freezing, and \{CO2\} injury. Quality assurance is an integral part of most manufacturing industries, including food processing. There is less motivation to develop quality management programs for fresh produce than for other food items, partly because of the generic nature of produce marketing and the difficulty of applying principles developed for processed foods to living respiring tissue. Fresh produce is a major profit center for supermarket food chains. Fierce competition among chains is changing the merchandising of fresh items. With the exception of a few commodities, most fresh fruits and vegetables are marketed at retail in bulk displays without brand identification. Brands are used in marketing schemes of shippers directed at wholesale distributors, but whether brands will have an impact at retail distribution points is still uncertain. The growing demand for fresh fruits and vegetables by health-conscious consumers also results in increased concern about food safety. Media attention to the use of agricultural chemicals to maintain “cosmetic” quality of fresh produce has heightened this concern. It is not clear how much pesticide use can be reduced without loss of visual quality of fresh fruits and vegetables, nor is it clear how lower visual quality would affect consumption. "

The observed parameters included variations in temperature during hydrocooling, biochemical properties of the pericarp, and fluctuations in the content of soluble solids and titratable acids in the aril during storage. Hydrocooling for 30 min reduced the temperature of the pericarp by 6.2 ± 0.3 °C. It also delayed the increase in electrolyte leakage and polyphenol oxidase and peroxidase activity in the pericarp.

Color as well as lycopene content is the most important factors in the visual and nutraceutical quality of tomatoes, and they are factors affected by temperature and light inside the greenhouse. The objective of this study was to compare color development and lycopene accumulation in tomato fruits cv. ‘Geronimo’ at different maturity stages, grown in greenhouses covered with two types of covers (double-layer polyethylene \{K50\} Clear + \{K50\} IR/AC or flat glass 4 mm thick coated with a 15% CaCO3 solution) in different periods of production. At 21, 25 and 29 weeks after transplanting, 24 clusters of tomatoes were labeled per experimental unit and three weeks after labeling, tomato fruits were harvested, classified by maturity, and analyzed for color index (a*/b*) and lycopene content. External and internal temperatures and light data were recorded through a meteorological station system with automatic control. Our results suggested that the season of production, temperature and lighting conditions in the greenhouse, affected the lycopene biosynthesis process. Lycopene content increased as the photoperiod was expanded and at the 32nd week, was higher in fruits collected in greenhouses with double layer of polyethylene (414 μg g−1 freeze-dried fruit) than that in fruits grown under a covered with flat glass coated with CaCO3 (241 μg g−1 freeze-dried fruit). The application of 15% CaCO3 solution helped to control the temperature but limited the lycopene biosynthesis. Tomato fruits that received greater amounts of light accumulated more lycopene and had the highest color index (1.22) which shows that it is possible that the accumulation of more lycopene is correlated to the transmittance of the cover. The temperature control through bleaching, washing and shading techniques could be improved if the light intensity needed to improve the fruit color development and lycopene accumulation is considered.

In addition, the fruit is used in food industry in the manufacture of jellies, concentrates, and flavouring and colouring agents. Pomegranate juice is a rich source of antioxidant, found to be higher than other natural juices and beverages such as green tea and red wine. The stability and concentration of these functional properties are affected by preharvest factors such as cultivar, agro-climatic conditions, maturity, harvest season, irrigation and fertilization and postharvest factors such as storage, packaging and treatments. This review discusses in details the preharvest and postharvest factors influencing the functional properties of pomegranate fruit. "

Although the skin was the major barrier to gas transport, the internal gas gradients in the fruit could not be neglected. Especially at high temperatures, when the respiration rate is high, the internal gradients increased considerably. A sensitivity analysis was carried out to assess the effect of biological variability present on the respiration and diffusion parameters, and on the gas concentration profiles. It was found that at room temperature, the \{O2\} concentration underneath the fruit skin is mainly determined by the \{O2\} transfer coefficient and consumption rate. However, for typical storage temperatures this dependency is less pronounced. A comparison of simulated gas concentration contours of pears stored with delayed controlled atmosphere and those immediately stored under controlled atmosphere (CA), illustrated the importance of an appropriate storage management right after harvest. When \{CA\} storage was applied immediately after harvest, the \{O2\} and \{CO2\} concentrations reached very low and very high values, respectively, possibly causing irreversible membrane damage and inducing core breakdown. These values were not found for delayed controlled atmosphere. A model validation experiment on affected pears indicated that the diffusion and respiration parameters for affected tissue were different from those for healthy tissue. "

Leaf area and canopy density enhanced shade conditions and altered microclimate inside ‘Bouhouli’ fig tree. With leaf area index (LAI) of about 3.3 there was a tendency to have smaller, firmer and lighter skin coloured fruit inside the canopy. Altitude level had a little influence on quality of ‘Bouhouli’ figs. Though, fruits from mountainous zone of ‘Djebba’ ripened earlier and were heavier and less acid than fruits from nearby plain of ‘Thibar’. Position of the fruit in the canopy significantly affected fruit firmness, titratable acidity (TA) and TSS:TA ratio (p &lt; 0.01). There were greater fruit loads with soften receptacle and lower acidity in the outside canopy positions than in the inside positions. No differences exist in dry matter (18.7%) and soluble solids content (18.3%) between light exposed and shaded fruits. Yet, TSS:TA ratio was higher in figs harvested from the periphery. Sugar and organic acid concentrations were little influenced by fruit position in altitude or in the tree. Glucose, fructose and sucrose showed the same proportions 0.47, 0.38 and 0.15, respectively, inside and outside the canopy. Citric acid, the predominant organic acid in figs, had comparable concentrations in fruit from inner and outer part of the tree. Citric acid levels were though different (p &lt; 0.05) between fruits from the two locations (1.95 mequiv./100 g \{FW\} in the plain versus 2.80 mequiv./100 g \{FW\} in the mountain). Temperature was positively correlated with fresh weight (r = 0.74*) but negatively correlated with firmness and titratable acidity (r = −0.91**). High temperature degrees during maturity enhance fruit enlargement and softening and reduce acidity of fig juice. Growing figs in mountainous and uneven zones with high altitude remains profitable to farmers living these areas. To improve light penetration into the foliage, summer pruning, leaf removal and shoot vigour control, little practiced in fig species, are recommended close to maturity and lead to homogeneous quality of fig crops.

However, in the traditional cooling system of strawberry considerable differences are observed between the fruit temperature located in the individual packages as well as in the various packages inside the tray. As a result, the self-life of fruit decreases. The aim of this research was introducing the new package and cooling system for precooling of strawberry in which some improvements were made in the uniformity of cooling of strawberry and reduced the fruit decay. The cooling process of strawberry was simulated based on simultaneous airflow and heat transfer process inside the new system and the developed model was validated experimentally, and a good agreement observed between the simulated and measured temperature of fruit. The results of simulator and experimental data showed that the new system had the higher uniformity in the cooling of fruit as compare with the traditional system so that the packages located along the cold air direction received the equal airflow rate. As a result, a difference of 0.84 °C was measured in the average fruit temperature of the packages after 3 h of cooling meaning that the differences in the 7/8th cooling time of fruit between the packages is negligible. Therefore, with the same airflow rate of traditional system, the cooling time of strawberries could be reducing by the proposed system significantly. "

Two experiments were conducted wherein fruit were subjected, in the first experiment, to ethylene degreening and a delay in commencement of cold storage (2004), and, in the second experiment, fruit were sampled from the inside and outside of the canopy and cold-stored at either −0.5 °C or 7.5 °C during 2005 and 2007. Rind pigment and carbohydrate contents as well as rind colour and \{RBD\} incidence were recorded during prolonged storage. The senescence-promoting treatments resulted in an increase in \{RBD\} incidence, except for storage at −0.5 °C, which resulted in a lower occurrence of RBD. Overall, results indicated that the incidence of \{RBD\} was aggravated by senescence-promoting factors during the postharvest handling of fruit and this is thought to lead to the premature senescence of the flavedo. In addition, fruit position in the tree canopy during fruit development contributed significantly to \{RBD\} sensitivity, with inside fruit having significantly higher \{RBD\} incidence compared to outside fruit.

Immediately after the bruising, no visible injury on the fruits was evident, but the fruits deteriorated rapidly during storage. The skin tissues of the fruits stored at 20 °C became more reddish with the duration of the storage, but no such changes were found with the fruits stored at 0 °C. The increase in redness of the skin tissues appeared to be associated with storage temperature, but not with the bruising. The skin tissues also became darker when stored at 20 °C than at 0 °C and this tendency was more obvious with the bruised fruits. Flesh firmness decreased rapidly during storage except for the non-bruised fruits stored at 0 °C. Even the non-bruised fruits rapidly lost their flesh firmness at 20 °C. No significant changes in lipid peroxidation, as expressed by malondialdehyde production, were found between the bruised and the non-bruised fruits during the storage either at 0 °C or at 20 °C. This implies that the fruit deterioration caused by bruising is not due to the consequences of lipid peroxidation. Polyphenol oxidase activity increased more rapidly in the bruised fruits than in the non-bruised fruits during storage. The bruising had more effect on increasing polyphenol oxidase activity than did the storage temperature. Although the increase in polyphenol oxidase activity appeared to be associated with the visual deterioration of the bruised fruits, it did not exactly correspond to the physical deterioration. These results indicate that polyphenol oxidase is not the only factor influencing the deterioration associated with bruising. Cell wall hydrolases are currently being assayed to determine if they also contribute the deterioration following bruising. "

The accuracy of qRT-PCR data largely depends on the stability of the reference genes used for data normalization. Thus, the selection of suitable reference genes for qRT-PCR is necessary for accurate gene expression, especially under specific experimental conditions. In this study, stably expressed genes in peach fruit stored at various postharvest temperatures were screened based on RNA-seq data. Four newly identified stable genes and 12 traditional reference genes were selected as candidates. Their expression stability was examined in the peel and flesh of peach stored at five different temperatures (5 °C, 15 °C, 25 °C, ambient temperature, and 35 °C). Gene expression was further characterized in different plant tissues (root, stem, leaf, flower, and fruit) and fruit developmental stages. The overall performance of each candidate in all sample sets was also evaluated. As a result, the expression of PpeIF-1A was the most stable across the set of all samples, peel and flesh samples at different storage temperatures, and fruit developmental stages. PpGAPDH stability ranked highest in plant tissues. In general, PpeIF-1A and PpMUB6 were the most appropriate reference genes for all five experiments whereas PpRPS28, PpRPT-5A, and PpAKT3 were unsuitable control genes with variable expression patterns. The relative expression of the phytoene synthase gene PpPSY1 was assessed to confirm the utility of the selected reference genes in this study. Taken together, this study identified the reference genes suitable for the accurate and reliable normalization of peach gene expression data under different experimental conditions. The novel reference gene PpMUB6 exhibited stable expression compared to most of the traditional reference genes. These results provide guidance for selecting reliable internal control genes and will benefit future gene expression analysis in a wide variety of conditions in peach. "

An accurate representation of crop phenology and physiology in ecosystem models is important in order to investigate the interactive processes between atmosphere and biosphere. A new phenological model for crops has been recently incorporated into the ecosystem model BIOME-BGC. Fruit compartments as well as a module for harvest were added to the original model. Here we explore whether eddy flux measurements of agricultural ecosystems are helpful to identify the spatially generalized ecophysiological parameters of the ANTHRO-BGC model (updated BIOME-BGC model) for croplands. The maximum, minimum, and reference values of the ANTHRO-BGC parameters were derived from a literature review. The sensitive parameters of the model were detected by using global sensitivity analysis. The spatially generalized values of ecophysiological parameters for wheat, barley, and rape within a typical temperature and precipitation range in western and central Europe were identified with the help of optimization algorithms and eddy covariance measurements of carbon and water fluxes of agricultural ecosystems as observational constraints. Gross primary productivity (GPP) provided the best constraint on the model parameters for all the three crop types. The validity range of the parameter values defined by the literature review was proved to be reliable. The predictive ability of the optimized model has been improved for \{GPP\} and net ecosystem exchange (NEE), but not for evapotranspiration (ET). The performance of the ANTHRO-BGC model was comparable to the performances of other crop models such as DNDC, CERES-EGC, ORCHIDEE-STICS, and \{SPA\} model, tested on multiple sites. The optimized ANTHRO-BGC model was relatively stable in response to the variation of the parameters on multiple sites and years. "

abstract = "After harvest, dessert grapes are very susceptible to loss of water and to rotting. The rate of deterioration of these grapes is directly linked to temperature. Rapid reduction of temperature to 0.5°C reduces loss of water and extent of rotting. The results of not doing so are unattractive brown, shrivelled and fragile stalks, berries shed from the stalk, soft, dull or even shrivelled berries, slack packs which are suspectible to vibration during handling and transport. Neither vacuum cooling nor hydro-cooling is suitable for grapes; only air may be used. Grapes may be cooled by air in the following ways: cooling by parallel air flow in the direction of the long axis of the pack, turbulent air entering the orifices and cooling the grapes from the outside towards the centre of the pack; cooling by forced air, through the packages, the fruit being cooled from the top downwards; cooling by conduction, the pack being in a closed water-vapour-proof envelope, the berries being cooled by heat-transfer by conduction from the centre to the edges of the pack. Example of applications of these methods are given. "

A simulated transport study was used to assess the susceptibility of apple fruit inside two ventilated corrugated paperboard (VCP) packages (MK4 and MK6) commonly used in fresh produce industry for packing apple fruit. An electro-dynamic shaker was used to excite vibrations at three frequencies (9, 12 and 15 Hz) and 0.9 g amplitude for four hours, which is usually adopted for truck transport simulation. Packaging transmissibility and incidence of bruise damage were measured at different frequencies. Results showed that both the incidence and severity of apple bruising were affected by package design and frequency. For both package designs at the three vibration frequencies investigated, packaging transmissibility ranged from 100 to 250%, with the highest transmissibility observed on the \{MK6\} package with a lower length–to–height ratio at 12 Hz compared to the \{MK4\} package. Apple fruit inside the \{MK4\} package with higher length–to–height ratio had less damage than fruit inside the \{MK6\} package. Irrespective of the package design, apple fruit on the top layer were more susceptible to bruising and the range of the proportion of bruised apples was between 50 and 74% at all the three frequencies, which are rather extreme conditions that usually occur when loads of packed fruit damage during transport.

The simulation of olive yield has practical application in different price formation activities: in management of cropping systems, formation of stocks, commercialization, making of agricultural policies and zoning. Both meteorological and biological variables were considered, pollen indexes were constructed from daily pollen concentrations evaluated by use of aerobiological methodology. The monitored pollen quantities should be considered as a Proxy variable of the olive orchards located around the volumetric pollen traps, even if the final harvest could be highly dependent on local summer meteorological conditions. The model carried out by use of Panel data analysis has demonstrated a great interpretative capacity, considering contemporary meteorological and biological variables (pollen monitored with volumetric traps). The aggregation of historical data (1999–2008) with cross-section data (10 different pollen monitoring stations) permitted to investigate the variability information related to temporal and geographical dimensions. The entire volume of pollen grains emitted during flowering was redundant to investigate the future fruit formation while the specific and concentrated mass of pollen grains during the days before full flowering was related positively with the final production. The statistical technique utilized permitted to obtain interpretative results common to different geographical areas and not limited by local meteorological conditions. "

The effect of wounding and pathogen inoculation on lignin content, was also quantified. Lastly, the expression of several phenylpropanoid pathway-related genes was also analyzed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Results indicated that, in general, P. digitatum exhibited lower decay incidence and severity as time between wounding and inoculation increased. Decay incidence and severity were higher in fruit from the over-mature harvest than in fruit from immature and commercial harvests. P. expansum was able to infect fruit at 20 °C but lesions were small compared to lesion size of fruit stored at 4 °C. Lignin content in wounded fruit (control) and in samples wounded and inoculated with P. expansum was highest in fruit from the immature harvest at 7 d post-wounding and inoculation. Wounded fruit had higher expression of pal1, comt1 and pox1 genes at 48 h than at 24 h. However, samples inoculated with P. digitatum showed lower expression at 48 h than at 24 h.

Since peduncle discolouration and dehydration may indicate initial quality changes, subjectively graded changes in peduncle appearance are often used to evaluate the decline in fruit freshness. The aim of the present investigation was to objectively determine the properties of fruit peduncles and their applicability as indictors of fruit freshness. Changes in colour and structure (shrinkage, bending, etc.) of fruit peduncles, initially green, turgid and metabolically fully active at harvest, mainly result from variations in water status. Selected components of water status and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters were determined to objectively characterize cherry fruit peduncle properties under various postharvest storage conditions. Due to their low resistance to vapour transfer cherry fruit peduncles had much higher water and \{CO2\} losses than fruit bodies. During the initial postharvest phase they significantly (35–45%) contributed to fruit water losses. Although there was a pronounced water transfer from the bodies into the peduncles this could only initially buffer the rapid decline in peduncle water content, which in turn, resulted in decreased vapour transfer conductance, and respiration and photosynthetic activity. The decline in the maximum photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm), which also indirectly indicated chlorophyll degradation, was mainly due to water losses. Other temperature-dependent metabolic processes such as peduncle senescence affected these variations to a much lesser degree. The results show that changes in peduncle properties are acceptable indicators of losses of freshness in sweet cherries. "

However, it can also alter grape anthocyanin synthesis in answer to temperature stress. The aim of this work was to determine the impact of \{TPC\} in ‘Tannat’ grape vineyards on wine quality. The major makers of quality considered in this study were the wine anthocyanin characterization by HPLC-PDA-MSn, beverage's sensory evaluation by descriptive analysis, and color parameters by instrumental analysis. A total of three experiments were performed in different harvesting years. In 2011/12 (Experiment I), four applications were performed from the flowering to fruiting. For the second experiment (2012/13), five applications were used only during fruiting. \{TPC\} treatment performed in 2013/14 (Experiment III) had a total of 19 applications from the flowering to harvesting. In the first experiment, \{TPC\} had increased wine pigments, color, and sensorial descriptors for visual (translucence) and gustatory (woody and body) perceptions. However, in the second experiment none of the evaluated wine quality parameters was affected by \{TPC\} (p ≤ 0.05). In the last and longest experiment (19 applications), \{TPC\} has significantly increased some wine pigments content. Nonetheless, wine sensorial parameters were not affected. Since the climate was different among the years, it seems that \{TPC\} effect does not depend on the applications number and vegetable cycle period only, but also it can be affected by the weather conditions in which the vine is being cultivated. However, when \{TPC\} treatment has resulted in the greatest anthocyanin increment (Experiment I) some wine sensory descriptors were also improved. "

This technique provides a stiffness factor S, based on the first resonance frequency and the mass of the intact fruit. A logarithmic relation was found between objective stiffness measurements on tomatoes by the acoustic impulse-response technique and subjective firmness measurements, suggesting that subjective measurements distinguish firmness differences more easily in soft than in firm tomatoes. Accuracy and repeatability of the acoustic impulse-response technique and of subjective scores by market experts were equally high. However, the advantage of using S is that it is objective and no scaling problems between different experts occur. In soft fruit only a stiffness difference as large as 2.5×106 Hz2 g2/3 could be distinguished with satisfactory accuracy by all experts. Tomatoes with a stiffness of 2.0×106 Hz2 g2/3 or less had more than 50% chance of being rejected. The acoustic impulse-response technique was also used to study firmness changes of tomatoes during storage, and the influence of variety, producer, season, production method, maturity at the time of picking, and storage conditions. Change in stiffness as a function of time could be expressed as a decreasing exponential function. Tomatoes stored at 20°C had the same deterioration constant, regardless of maturity at harvest. However, when fruit were stored at 12°C, the deterioration constant of the three tested varieties was greater for red than for orange fruit. The deterioration constant was much higher for fruit harvested in spring than in the other seasons. The influence of temperature could be expressed in the form of an Arrhenius equation. The model was validated for tomatoes subjected to fluctuating temperatures. "

The total phenolic content, total flavonoid and \{DPPH\} free radical scavenging activity, pH, lactic acid, vitamin C, moisture, carbohydrate, protein and trace element content of the samples were analysed. The antioxidant potential of the T. tetraptera extract was observed to be enhanced in the solvent used for the extraction after the irradiation but not the radiation dose used. Irradiation only had substantial impacts on carbohydrate and protein, Cu, Mg, and Mn. The T. tetraptera studied was safe for human consumption as far as trace metal levels are concerned.

In addition, the survival of Bt isolates on orange fruit surfaces were evaluated by recovering and quantifying the number of \{CFU\} every seven days for up to 28 days. The declines in survival rates on orange fruit surfaces were drastic for the three strains of Bt in the first week. The \{CFU\} numbers of all applied isolates declined by 4 to 5 orders of magnitude after storage at room temperature for 28 days.

This research studied the effects of thermal inactivation of B. cinerea in synthetic medium and strawberry puree using hot water baths at different temperatures. These media were studied in order to determine if results obtained in a solution with the major components of the fruit (synthetic media), are comparable to the ones obtained in fruit purees. The results demonstrated that B. cinerea spores can be inactivated by heat treatments using relatively low temperatures (42–46 °C). Inactivation curves were well described by first order kinetics (R2 0.91–0.99). B. cinerea conidia inoculated in synthetic medium required less time to achieve one log reduction in population than those inoculated in the fruit puree. D values were 22, 8.5, 4 and 1.4 min at 42, 44, 46 and 48 °C, respectively, in synthetic medium; while D values in strawberry puree were 44.9, 13.8, 4.7 and 1.4 min at 42, 44, 46 and 48 °C, respectively. The z values obtained were 4.15 and 5.08 °C for the strawberry puree and synthetic medium respectively, showing higher sensitivity of B. cinerea in fruit purees than in the synthetic medium. Thus, a change in the medium composition had a marked difference in the heat inactivation of B. cinerea conidia, and the results obtained in synthetic medium are not accurate to describe the behavior of the microorganism in the fruit.

It is also common to hold fruit without any prior ripening for a few days to several weeks prior to ethylene treatment and final ripening. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of these practices on ripening time and subsequent fruit quality. ‘Hass’ avocados were harvested from three different orchards on six harvest dates and placed at either 5 °C or 12 °C immediately after harvest or after ripening to average firmness values of either 80 N (partially ripe) or 19 N (near ripe). After storage the fruit were then ripened to eating firmness (4.4–6.7 N) and evaluated for quality parameters. A portion of the fruit at harvest firmness were stored for 0 d, 7 d, 14 d or 28 d and then treated with ethylene to ripen the fruit. Continual softening during storage resulted in fruit that had been ripened prior to storage being nearly at eating firmness at the end of 14 d, especially those stored at 12 °C. Stem end rot, body rot and pink staining of the vascular tissue occurred more frequently in the previously-ripened fruit after 14 d, the severity being greatest at 12 °C where the incidence exceeded 50% for both stem end rot and pink staining. Both harvest date and orchard influenced the amount of pink staining observed. Storage of firm fruit prior to ethylene treatment resulted in higher levels of both stem end rot and pink staining only when the storage time exceeded 14 d. In an additional study to assess the impact of the storage of partially-ripened fruit on both quality and sensory characteristics, ‘Hass’ avocados were harvested six times at monthly intervals, ripened to approximately 16 N firmness at 20 °C and then placed at either 1 °C or 5 °C for 7 d or 14 d. Following storage the fruit were ripened to eating firmness and evaluated. The occurrence of fruit quality defects was not affected by the timing of ripening. Sensory panelists liked fruit ripened prior to or after cold storage equally well and there were no differences among the ripening treatments, within a storage time, in the level of rich, nutty or grassy attributes that composed the fruit flavor. There were statistically-significant differences in the degree of textural creaminess among the ripening treatments, although these differences were inconsistent and slight. Storing partially ripe ‘Hass’ avocados for up to 4 d at either 1 °C, 5 °C or 12 °C does not greatly alter avocado quality, while storage for longer periods, such as 14 d, may be problematic due to enhanced development of decay and pink staining, especially at higher temperatures. Holding unripe avocados for longer than 14 d prior to ethylene treatment may predispose the fruit to the development of pink staining. "

The critical minimum period for \{DCA\} to control superficial scald was also investigated. Fruit were stored in \{DCA\} at 0 °C for 5 d up to 20 w followed by 6 or 10 w simulated handling temperature (−0.5 °C) for long distant supply chains plus 7 d at 20 °C. The scald potential for each storage duration in each season was assessed by storing fruit in air as the control treatment. To determine critical minimum storage period, simulated shipping of fruit in air for extended period of 10 w was used. Superficial scald incidence and fruit quality parameters such as total soluble solids (TSS), titratable acidity (TA), fruit firmness and ground colour were measured. The evolution of metabolites (α-farnesene, 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one (MHO) and ethylene) associated with scald development were also monitored. The results showed that \{DCA\} controlled superficial scald in pre-optimally and optimally harvested fruit in both growing seasons. Results on the minimum exposure period were highly inconsistent over the two season, however, it was found that exposing \{DCA\} treated fruit to 10 w shipment period increases the risk of superficial scald development. All \{DCA\} treated fruit, regardless of the exposure period, can withstand only 6 w shipment period. For all the storage regimes, \{DCA\} stored fruit appeared to have a higher ground colour and fruit firmness compared to air stored fruit. All \{DCA\} stored fruit had lower concentrations of ethylene, α-farnesene and MHO. The Pearson’s correlation showed a strong relationship among scald associated metabolites. Correlation coefficient for α-farnesene and \{MHO\} of fruit stored in air and \{DCA\} were 0.831 and 0.822, respectively, while those for scald incidence and \{MHO\} were 0.863 and 0.365 in air and DCA, respectively.

Compositional analysis revealed substantial cultivar differences; the ‘Morphitiki’ fruit was more acidic and showed higher contents of total phenolics, flavonoids and hydroxycinnamic acid-derivatives as well as greater antioxidant potency. Although firmness did not change markedly during storage, the cell wall exhibited extensive remodeling. Greater changes were observed in the pectin backbones than in polyuronide side chains and cross-linking glycans. Polygalacturonase (PG) showed better association with cell wall solubilization at \{RT\} than the enzymes involved in arabinan or galactan disassembly. During postharvest ripening after harvest, ‘Karantoki’ showed more extensive pectin solubilization than ‘Morphitiki’. Interestingly, cold storage inhibited the cell wall disassembly in ‘Karantoki’ but not in ‘Morphitiki’, suggesting that the cultivars may differ in their susceptibility to chilling-related wall disorders. Low temperature-induced alterations in wall disassembly may impact juice and phytochemical release upon consumption. "

The results showed that there was a clear link between phenolic content and antioxidant activity, so that dose range of 900 Gy and higher significantly decreased phenolic content and antioxidant activity. The moisture percent of stored apples was more responsive to irradiation (at doses of 900–1200 Gy) than storage time and pathogen. Lesion diameter of pathogen-treated non-irradiated apples was significantly increased after three months. This means that storage at low temperature is not enough to avoid blue mold growth. As dose and storage time increased firmness decreased; also pathogen accelerated softening of stored apples. This study showed conclusively that low irradiation doses (300 and 600 Gy) combined with cold storage is a way to minimize apple quality losses during nine month storage period. "

The wastewater generated in the fruit process after cleaning the fruit also contains pesticides in concentrations that cannot be dumped into the environment so these substances have to be previously eliminated. As thermal and the biological treatments do not degrade most pesticides used, an alternative treatment has to be applied to eliminate these toxic compounds both in fruit juices and wastewater. In the present work, a photochemical treatment with \{UV\} radiation was applied to eliminate thiabendazole from aqueous solutions at different pH and temperatures, using a medium-pressure mercury lamp that emitted in the range of wavelengths between 255 and 750 nm. The absorbed radiation was calculated as a function of the concentration of thiabendazole. A reaction mechanism was proposed, so combining it with the mathematical relation found between the absorbed radiation and thiabendazole concentration suggests a pseudo-first-order kinetic model that, for the range of concentrations studied, can be simplified to a zero-order kinetic model, both of which fit the experimental data obtained well.

Knowledge of the differences in membrane composition and antioxidant levels during plum fruit development in both chilling resistant and -susceptible plum cultivars could help to establish or improve current orchard and/or postharvest handling practices to alleviate the occurrence of chilling injury in susceptible cultivars. The aim of this study was to determine if apparent differences in cell membrane composition and antioxidant levels between chilling susceptible (in this study ‘Sapphire’) and chilling resistant (in this study ‘Angeleno’) plum cultivars already exist during fruit development. Regarding antioxidants, ‘Sapphire’ accumulated higher levels of glutathione, while ‘Angeleno’ accumulated higher levels of ascorbic acid. The driving factor for chilling susceptibility in ‘Sapphire’ plums seems to be the cultivar's ability to accumulate higher levels of linoleic acid compared to oleic acid. Linoleic acid (a polyunsaturated fatty acid) is more susceptible to lipid peroxidation than oleic acid (a monounsaturated fatty acid). ‘Angeleno’ accumulated higher levels of oleic acid, compared to linoleic acid, which probably renders the cultivar more tolerant to low temperature storage. The difference in the antioxidants and phospholipid fatty acids that were accumulated in the two cultivars is related to the time the fruit spend on the tree during fruit development. ‘Sapphire’ is an early season cultivar which, therefore, experiences lower average daily temperatures during fruit development. Glutathione and linoleic acid accumulate under lower temperatures. ‘Angeleno’ is a late season cultivar, experiencing higher average daily temperatures during the latter half of its fruit development period. Higher temperatures favour the accumulation of ascorbic acid and oleic acid. "

abstract = "Abstract Postharvest losses of fresh vegetables are mostly caused by microbial infections. Furthermore, contamination of raw-consumed fruits and vegetables with human pathogens may lead to serious foodborne illness. Washing with tap water reduces the total number of produce surface attached microorganisms by only 1–2 log. Addition of sanitizers to washing waters can help to effectively reduce the microbial load. However, some sanitizers are less successful than initially assumed and/or may negatively affect produce quality. During recent years, efficiency of chlorine dioxide (ClO2) applications was tested as an alternative sanitation agent for fresh produce. Most published studies, however, were planned and performed under laboratory conditions, i.e. in tap water with a low chemical oxygen demand (COD). Thus, they do not necessarily reflect the practical conditions in processing lines, where effluent produce sap may largely increase COD. Factors such as pH, temperature and load of organic matter may influence the actual biocidal efficiency of ClO2. Successful technical implementations, thus, require information about the relationship between efficiency of ClO2 and influencing factors. Here, a comprehensive evaluation of the influence of temperature on the effectiveness of ClO2 treatment (ClO2 concentrations = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 mg L−1) on Escherichia coli (starting load: 5 105 cfu mL−1) and the influence of organic matter load on the effective ClO2 concentration in lettuce washing water is provided. Decreasing the temperature of the processing water (from 15 °C to 2 °C) resulted in a reduced and delayed reduction of E. coli counts. At 15 °C, not at 2 °C, a significant reduction of E. coli was found after 2 min. At a ClO2 concentration of 3 mg L−1, microbes were significantly and completely inactivated at 15 °C after 0.5 min. In contrast, E. coli loads were significantly, but only incompletely reduced at 2 °C after 1 min. The increase in \{COD\} from 250 mg L−1 to 1000 mg L−1 by the addition of respective amounts of organic matter resulted in a pronounced increase in the ClO2 demand. "

This paper describes a study that examines the pattern of soluble solids accumulation in ‘Hayward’ kiwifruit beyond the simple timing at which fruit reach 6.2% and investigates the relationship between soluble solids accumulation and postharvest performance assessed as softening and expression of chilling injury. This has been done using fruit from 10 orchards harvested at a range of \{SSC\} from 5 to 10% during one season. Soluble solids accumulation showed a general trend for a change from slow to more rapid accumulation during the season that could be described by a single logistic curve. The point at which the rate of soluble solids accumulation increased was more or less distinct for fruit from different orchards and occurred when fruit were at \{SSC\} between 6.3 and 7.4%. It is also possible that there is not a consistent change in soluble solids accumulation rate, with the rate being dependent on the environmental conditions over several days before measurement. There was a major change in softening pattern and low temperature breakdown susceptibility between fruit harvested at 6.4 and at 8.0% SSC. This change coincided with a change to faster soluble solids accumulation at harvest. It is concluded that the pattern, or rate, of soluble solids accumulation is likely to be a more robust indicator of the physiological state of the fruit, and therefore postharvest performance, than a single \{SSC\} value.

Its fruit is a good source of nutrients and it is highly appreciated in Mexico and countries of Central and South America because of its pleasant and sweet flavour and the bright deep orange–red colour of the pulp. A clear demand for the fruit exists in these countries and has been recently reported in other countries such as Australia, Israel, Philippines and Spain. This paper reviews information on postharvest biology and technology of sapote mamey fruit published by several authors in the past 60 years and presents experimental data obtained in the last 10 years by our research group. Topics deal with postharvest handling and physiology; changes of quality attributes during ripening such as colour, total soluble solids, firmness, water content, sugars and carotenoids; diseases, insects and disorders during storage; and responses to low temperatures. The effect of controlled and modified atmospheres on the postharvest life and quality of sapote mamey is also discussed. Other postharvest treatments and technologies that have been evaluated on this fruit are also revised, including the use of ethrel, the application of the ethylene action inhibitor 1-methylcyclopropane and the effect of heat treatments for quarantine purposes and waxing to extend the storage life. Since the preservation and exchange of native material is essential for breeding studies and for making new improved varieties available for commercial production, the creation of a bank of germplasm is an idea also presented in the paper. We believe this review will serve as a useful reference for those studying and investigating postharvest aspects of sapote mamey fruit. Hopefully, it will also encourage future research to preserve the quality, minimize postharvest loses and increase the demand for this pleasant and exotic fruit. "

The potential to use fruit characteristics (flesh colour, soluble solids content (SSC), dry matter and firmness) estimated non-destructively at harvest as markers for the susceptibility of ‘Hort16A’ kiwifruit to chilling injury (CI) has been investigated for individual fruit. While the fruit that developed \{CI\} during storage were some of the least advanced fruit on each orchard, the flesh colour, SSC, firmness and dry matter of the susceptible fruit differed considerably among orchards, such that there was not a clear minimum or maximum threshold for which fruit did or did not develop \{CI\} across all orchards. There was a large ‘orchard factor’ in the susceptibility of fruit to \{CI\} that was as important, if not more important, than the flesh colour, SSC, firmness and dry matter values. The ‘orchard factor’ may derive from a combination of environmental conditions and/or orchard management practices, in conjunction with fruit growth and development. Hence it is concluded that a generally applicable at-harvest prediction of ‘Hort16A’ fruit susceptibility to \{CI\} is not possible from an at-harvest non-destructive estimation of flesh colour, SSC, firmness and dry matter.

abstract = "Abstract Litchi fruit (Litchi chinensis Sonn.) is highly perishable after harvest. The shelf life is only 4–6 days under ambient temperature storage conditions, which has restricted the development of the litchi industry to a considerable extent. To investigate the molecular mechanisms of litchi fruit senescence, comparative proteomic analysis was carried out on litchi pulp. After two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE), 64 spots were significantly differentially expressed, 61 of which were successfully identified using liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (LC–ESI–MS/MS). All of the identified proteins were classified according to biological process, molecular function, and cellular component using Blast2GO. Results showed that those proteins were mainly involved in signal transduction, cell wall metabolism, primary and secondary metabolism, energy metabolism. Specifically, many up-regulated proteins were involved in auxin/ethylene regulation, which suggested that auxin and ethylene might cooperate to regulate litchi pulp senescence. Histone deacetylase and \{DNA\} methyltransferase might involve the down-regulation of proteins related to reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging, glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and \{ATP\} synthesis in litchi senescence. A higher proportion of differentially expressed proteins were up-regulated and these were involved in a range of processes including cell wall organization or biogenesis, anaerobic respiration, protein degradation, lipid degradation. All of those proteins might accelerate fruit softening, deterioration and senescence. This study is the first to carry out proteomic analysis of the regulation of litchi fruit senescence. "

Citrate and phosphate buffers supported the growth of the fungus over a wide range of pH. However, acetate buffer failed to support its growth. The organism was able to proliferate on green, unripe as well as ripe fruit but needed mechanical injury for infection. The pathogen was able to cause total spoilage of the fruit within 48 h.

Jonagold apples were harvested at commercial maturity and stored at different temperatures and controlled atmosphere conditions for 6 months, followed by exposure to ambient shelf life conditions (20 °C under air) for 2 weeks. The composition of the pectic material was analysed. Furthermore, the firmness and the ethylene production of the apples were assessed. Generally, the main changes in pectin composition associated with the loss of firmness during ripening in Jonagold apples were a loss of side chains neutral sugars, increased water solubility and decreased molar mass. Also, the activities of four important enzymes possibly involved in apple softening, β-galactosidase, α-arabinofuranosidase, polygalacturonase and pectin methylesterase, were measured. Pectin-related enzyme activities highly correlated with ethylene production, but not always with pectin modifications. "

Changes in the storage relative humidity (RH), in particular transfer of dehydrated fruit to high RH, have been shown to induce and aggravate peel pitting. In this study, we have examined morphological and structural changes, and its relation to water potential (ΨW), in flavedo and albedo of ‘Navelate’ fruit exposed to postharvest storage conditions inducing rind breakdown. Cryo-scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations revealed no signs of cell disruption or collapse in epidermal and flavedo cells from fruit stored up to 1 month at 95% RH. Under low RH, flavedo became less compacted and outer layers were translucent. Albedo cells dehydrated by storage at 45% \{RH\} became progressively compacted, forming clusters of amorphous and flattered cells, in which the typical spongy structure of the albedo was gradually lost. After prolonged dehydration, cracks and fractures in the wall of albedo cells were evident. Normal structure and morphology of albedo cells were not recovered after fruit transfer from low to high RH, even after prolonged storage at high RH. Injuries in albedo cells and the connecting arms were detected soon after the shift in postharvest \{RH\} and progressively increased in number and length. Associated with these morphological alterations, important changes in water potential of flavedo and albedo cells were also noted, that were more pronounced in flavedo than in albedo. Collectively, the results suggest that changes in postharvest \{RH\} produced water content adjustment and water movement within the peel tissue that may underlie the morphological and structural alterations accompanying postharvest rind breakdown in ‘Navelate’ orange fruit.

After harvest, climacteric fruit such as papaya are subject to a range of problems associated with postharvest handling and storage treatments. There have been few attempts to evaluate the role of \{ERFs\} in fruit's responses to environmental stimuli. To investigate the transcriptional mechanisms underlying fruit developmental, ripening and stresses, we cloned four \{ERFs\} from papaya. The deduced amino acid sequence of CpERFs contained the conserved apetalous (AP2)/ERF domain, which shared high similarity with other reported AP2/ERF domains. The phylogeny, gene structures, and putatively conserved motifs in papaya \{ERF\} proteins were analyzed, and compared with those of Arabidopsis. Expression patterns of CpERFs were examined during fruit development, under 1-MCP treatment, ethephon treatment, biotic stress (temperature stress) and pathogen stress. CpERFs displayed differential expression patterns and expression levels under different experimental conditions. CpERF2 and CpERF3 showed a close association with fruit ripening and CpERFs had a high expression level in the earlier stages during the fruit development period. The expression of CpERFs strongly associated with stress response. These results support the role for papaya \{ERFs\} in transcriptional regulation of ripening-related or stress-respond genes and thus, in the regulation of papaya fruit-ripening processes and stress responses.

In Chile alone, there are nearly 40,000 ha, distributed between the \{IV\} and \{VI\} regions, with production areas located close to both the coast and to the hills. Given the increasing competitiveness of fruit export markets, the quality of organoleptic attributes is a key issue in consumer acceptance. The quality of avocados is related to many attributes, especially oil content and firmness (among others), and these attributes are influenced by storage, growing and environmental conditions, as well as the stage of maturity/ripening. This study measured the fatty acid profiles of avocado fruits during two seasons from 12 localities cultivated with the variety ‘Hass.’ Fifty additional variables were measured, including climate, nutrition, vegetative development, and agricultural management (called pre-harvest variables). The data obtained were analyzed with a partial mean squares multivariate regression (PLS). The analysis showed that the contents of oleic, palmitic, and palmitoleic acids were influenced by climatic and nutritional factors, with mean annual maximum temperature proving most important. In localities with lower temperatures, the 18-carbon fatty acid content increased, and the 16-carbon fatty acid content decreased. Moreover, the N and Mg contents in the mesocarp at harvest were related to the contents of palmitic and palmitoleic acids, and when the levels of N and Mg increased in the mesocarp, the 16-carbon fatty acid content decreased.

The fresh agricultural crops are highly seasonal and fruit must be transported over long distances to major market places. The fruits must be kept fresh and attractive for many days to maintain the fruit quality when they reach their markets. It is noted that initial cooling or removing the field heat of fruit after harvest is the most critical phase of the post-harvest procedure. The temperature of the fruit should be decreased down to 0°C within 15–20 minutes to store the cherries longer. This can be achieved by hydrocooling, where fruits pass through a tunnel of 0°C cold water for 15 minutes. Precooled cherries maintain their firmness, brightness, and the green color of their stems. It is important to use a cooling method that can minimize the energy cost while providing the optimum operating conditions. Underground thermal energy storage systems (UTES) that increase energy conservation and efficiency provide an alternative to the current precooling methods. "

Concentrations of ethanol in mature green fruit did not change during storage in both 21% and 2% \{O2\} atmospheres, but increased in fruit stored in 0.5% O2. The activities of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) in 2% and 21% \{O2\} atmospheres remained very low throughout the storage period, but significantly increased with 0.5% O2. After transferring fruit to regular air and trigging ripening with ethylene, yellowing of peel, fruit softening and hydrolysis of starch in fruit stored in low \{O2\} atmospheres were slower than in the control. Fruit stored in low \{O2\} also showed a delayed onset of the climacteric peak. The activities of \{ADH\} were lower in the low \{O2\} stored fruit than in the control fruit. Productions of ethyl acetate, isoamyl acetate, and isobutyl acetate were remarkably suppressed by low \{O2\} storage. Alcohol acetyltransferase activity increased gradually with storage time in all treatments, being significantly lower in fruit with low \{O2\} pretreatments.

Fruit softening, splitting and cracking are the major postharvest problems. When fruit reach the ethylene peak, activities of some cell wall hydrolase enzymes dramatically increase. Recommended storage temperatures are above 13 °C, and lower temperatures cause chilling injury. An atmosphere with 3–5% \{O2\} + 5–10% \{CO2\} has been recommended for sugar apple and atemoya storage. Alternatively, modified atmosphere packaging and 1-MCP treatments are promising techniques to extend storage life and maintain quality of sugar apple. However, improper concentrations of 1-MCP and/or high \{CO2\} can induce physiological disorders. "

abstract = "Abstract Some of South Africa’s fresh produce export markets require postharvest cold treatment of fruit as a phytosanitary risk mitigation treatment for Thaumatotibia leucotreta. Currently, the most widely used treatment entails a 22-d exposure to sub-zero temperatures. This treatment has been primarily based on studies conducted in the 1950s and 1960s. Given the age of the data and subsequent indications that a reduced duration treatment may be effective, a new set of cold treatment efficacy data was generated in this study. The treatments were tested at the probit 9 level, using fourth and fifth instar T. leucotreta, these instars having previously been shown to be the most cold-tolerant. Three time-temperature combinations using sub-zero temperatures were initially evaluated: 20 d, 18 d and 16 d at average temperatures in the range of −0.16 °C to −0.44 °C; and thereafter a time-temperature combination using an above-zero temperature was evaluated: 19 d at an average temperature of 1.05 °C. All treatments were shown to cause mortality at or in excess of the probit 9 level (99.9968% efficacy at the 95% confidence level). These results demonstrate the efficacy of the following potential postharvest cold treatments for T. leucotreta for phytosanitary treatment purposes: 16 d at −0.2 °C, 18 d at −0.4 °C, 20 d at −0.4 °C and 19 d at 1.0 °C, which are recommended for conversion into the following treatment protocols: 16 d at or below −0.1 °C, 18 d at or below −0.3 °C, 20 d at or below −0.3 °C and 19 d at or below 1.2 °C, commencing once all probe readings are at or below: −0.2 °C, −0.4 °C, −0.4 °C and 1.0 °C respectively. Relative to the cold treatments currently in use for T. leucotreta, the shorter duration and in some cases higher temperatures will be less costly and logistically easier to apply with reduced adverse effects in the form of fruit chilling injury and hence trade restriction.

By contrast, in fruit stored at constant temperature (20 °C), transfer from 45 to 95% \{RH\} increased the incidence of rind staining, despite the rate of weight loss being similar to that of fruit for which the storage temperature was reduced. This effect was more rapid in fruit exposed for prolonged periods at low RH. A marked and transient stimulation in the respiration rate and ethylene production was observed within 12–24 h of fruit being transferred from low to high RH. Water potential (Ψw) in flavedo and albedo tissue was reduced by storage of the fruit at 45% RH, and the capacity for it to recover after transfer to 95% \{RH\} was more rapid in the flavedo than in the albedo and dependent on the time of storage at low RH. The influence of preharvest susceptibility on the development of the disorder during postharvest storage in ‘Navelate’ sweet orange was also studied. Fruit harvested from orchards with a high incidence of rind breakdown on the tree were more prone to develop rind staining after storage, had higher ethylene production and low flavedo and albedo Ψw at harvest than fruit harvested from orchards not affected by natural rind breakdown. Collectively, these results indicate that in Navel oranges, alteration of peel water status is a critical factor in the incidence of postharvest rind breakdown, which is also highly influenced by fruit conditions at harvest.

This variety is potentially suitable for postharvest mechanical processing due to its particular morphology, greater firmness and the fact that it is harvested without a stem. In order to improve the postharvest shelf-life of this variety, we evaluated the residual effects of heat pre-treatments at 50 °C/2 min, hydro-cooling and normal cooling as a control, on respiratory metabolism and quality of the fruit, including respiration rate, soluble sugars, organic acids, decay and quality parameters, during storage at 0 °C for 5 and 10 days plus 2 and 4 days at 20 °C. In comparison with other sweet cherry varieties, at 20 °C the “Ambrunés” cherries had low respiratory activity suggesting a high potential for postharvest storage. Storage at low temperatures resulted in high respiration rates in fruit transferred to 20 °C, this being greater with increasing time of storage at 0 °C. The heat pre-treatments induced early ripening of the fruit, characterized by rapid consumption of glucose and malic acid, and loss of quality, especially increased softening after 10 days of storage plus 4 days at 20 °C. Hydro-cooling was a positive treatment in delaying senescence and prolonging the shelf-life of the fruit, diminishing the loss of quality. Hydro-cooling also slowed down sugar metabolism, diminishing the consumption of malic acid at 20 °C and maintaining glucose and sorbitol levels during storage at 0 °C. "

Similarly, modified atmosphere packaging positively affected the physiological and chemical quality of mangoes during storage. It also reduced the \{PWL\} and maintained better quality in terms of pH, AA, and marketability, compared to the quality of unpackaged mangoes throughout the storage period. Disinfecting mangoes significantly maintained the better appearance quality of mangoes compared to the control treatment. The two-way interaction between disinfection and storage conditions significantly (P&lt;0·05) affected the physiological and chemical quality of mangoes. Similarly, the three-way interaction between disinfection, modified atmosphere packaging and storage conditions had a significant effect (P&lt;0·01) on the quality parameters of mangoes. The benefits of the combined effects of postharvest treatments on mangoes included reduction in PWL, maintenance of better chemical quality and improvement in the shelf life of mangoes. "

Fruit calyxes showed reduced damage and remained greener in 1-MCP treated than in control fruit. 1-MCP treated eggplants showed lower weight loss. Pulp browning was clearly prevented as a consequence of 1-MCP exposure, and this was associated with delayed senescence, lower accumulation of total phenolics and reduced activity of PAL. The activity of the enzymes \{PPO\} and \{POD\} involved in the oxidation of phenolics compounds was also decreased in 1-MCP treated fruit.

Blueberries stored at low temperature (5 °C) maintained higher fruit firmness than those stored at 10 °C, which was due to the lower \{WSP\} content and higher contents of SSP, cellulose and hemicellulose. Meanwhile, the lower activities of cell wall degrading enzymes such as polygalacturonase, cellulase, β-galactosidase and α-mannosidase in blueberries at 5 °C were associated with greater fruit firmness and lower \{WSP\} content as compared to those in fruit stored at 10 °C.

The colorimetric maturity index (MIc) proposed, which integrates the three colorimetric coordinates, L*, a* and b*, shows very little interannual variability. It also shows a high degree of correlation with the number of days elapsing since the beginning of fruit development, with fruit growth and with the chemical maturity index, permitting the period of fruit growth and ripening to be divided into four phases running from the beginning of fruit development (MIc &lt; −20, immature very green fruit) until the time when fruit are ready for harvest (MIc &gt; 25, mature reddish yellow or red fruit). The index proved to be robust, with little interannual variability and a high degree of correlation with the number of days since the beginning of fruit development, fruit growth and the evolution of the chemical maturity index, permitting growers to determine cheaply, non-destructively and objectively the optimal moment for harvesting the varietal group “Mollar de Elche”.

As a general review on the biology of C. lanatus, this paper reviewed the current published literature (including our recent published studies) and also summarised extensive field and laboratory studies performed on its biology, phenology and management in the South-West Slopes of New South Wales. Recent population genetics studies conducted in Australia have shown that the species is monotypic, and was introduced as a single colonisation event in the mid 1800's. Our studies showed genetic diversity in C. lanatus to be non-existent across Australia and invasive ranges and highest in the native range in Africa. Further genetic analyses have shown the species in Australia is identical to Citrullus lanatus var. citroides, the citron melon, native to Africa and now naturalised across Africa, Asia and North America, where it is a weedy nuisance or occasionally a food source for livestock and humans. Although limited genotypic diversity may facilitate potential biocontrol strategies for Citrullus lanatus in Australia, biocontrol may be difficult due to its close genetic similarity to commercial watermelon, a major horticultural crop in Australia and more globally. In Australia, field germination was observed to occur during a two to three-month period between late spring and summer, when warm soil temperatures occurred and field establishment was typically observed after significant rainfall events and was associated with soil moisture availability. Controlled environment seed dormancy findings indicated that dormancy was significantly reduced by storage at ambient laboratory temperatures over eighteen months. Seed dormancy was transient and appeared to be both physical and physiological in nature, and was dependent on the period of after-ripening during the post-harvest period. Key reproductive attributes, including high seed production, self-compatibility and pollination facilitated by several non-specific pollinators have likely resulted in increased spread of this weed in Australia and more globally. Management of C. lanatus is achieved using \{IWM\} strategies including pre and post-emergent applications of herbicides as well as limiting fruit production by cultural practices including mowing, grazing and cultivation.

During harvest, packaging and transport, this protective layer may be damaged or removed. The resulting appearance generates the impression of poor fruit quality. The aim of this research was to analyse and compare the influence of this wax bloom on storability using a new non-invasive technology and three modifications of the fruit surface. Weight loss was recorded of plums with the natural wax layer, polished by hand or wax removed chemically and stored at 20 °C room temperature or in a refrigerator at 5 °C. With 9.2 mg epicuticular wax/fruit or 302 μg/cm2 surface, European plums were classified as highly waxy, which contributed to for their conspicuous wax bloom. The disappearance of the wax bloom viz. increase in glossiness, measured non-destructively with a special sensor, was associated with a doubling of luster levels from 150–250 arbitrary units (a.u.) to 300–600 a.u. after polishing, simulating postharvest handling. Luster levels decreased with time with the polished surface, but not with the natural wax layer, confirming the concomitant greatest weight loss during the 20 days storage of polished fruit. Weight loss was lowest in plums with the natural wax layer, refrigerated at 5 °C, while those stored at 20 °C lost more weight irrespective of surface treatment. This case study explains the relatively short shelf-life and effects of water loss of the plums under different temperatures and surface conditions with wax, polish and chemically treated. This affordable compact light-weight sensor technology offers the opportunity to detect the degree of glossiness and may be used for sorting a number of affected fruit. "

To determine the responses of fruits and the infection capacities of both moulds, two varieties of oranges at different maturity stages, different inoculum concentrations and two different storage temperatures were studied. In compatible interactions, no significant differences in rot dynamics among harvests were found with a 107 conidia mL−1 inoculum concentration at both temperatures tested (20 °C and 4 °C). However, at other inoculum concentrations, significant differences in rot dynamics were found, especially in immature fruits. Incompatible interactions showed that P. expansum could infect oranges at commercial maturity in both tested varieties. Decay incidence and severity were higher at 4 °C than at 20 °C. In addition to infection capacity studies, histochemical tests were performed to detect wound-healing compounds for both pathogens. A positive reaction for lignin was detected for both pathogens in immature oranges over a short period (48 h). In all cases, no reactions were found in control samples. Our results indicate that pathogen concentration, host maturity and storage temperature can play important roles in the defence mechanisms of fruit. Furthermore, to our knowledge, this is the first work that demonstrates that P. expansum can infect oranges under favourable conditions. "

abstract = "Microwave (MW) spectroscopy was studied as an internal-quality estimating technique for peaches. During two seasons, just harvested, early and mid-season, varieties were studied. The main objective of the research was to establish the feasibility of \{MW\} measurements for the firmness and sugar estimation of peaches. The \{MW\} parameter, return loss (LR in dB), was measured from 1 to 20 GHz, simultaneously with reference parameters such as firmness, acidity, sugar content and optical reflectance using a contact co-axial probe. The techniques used for amplifying the variability range of the fruit samples, by well-planned sampling and cold storage, were developed. It is shown that, while any reference parameter does not change significantly by the application of wet and dry cold treatments to the peaches, \{MW\} response changes greatly in the treated samples showing, in accordance with the literature, that dielectric response in fruits is greatly affected by moisture content and temperature. The return loss increases 50–100% when fruits are moist (submerged in water during 1 h) and cold (1 °C) as compared to dry fruits at ambient temperature (20 °C). Significant correlations were observed between return loss values obtained at the different measured frequencies: 1, 7, 9·9 and 19 GHz, when taken on the same fruit. Low correlation is observed between the values for \{LR\} at 7, 9·9 and 19 \{GHz\} with fruit firmness, which is not consistent enough to be applied for fruit inspection and sorting purposes. Different estimative models of fruit firmness were calculated for different peach samples. The multiple linear regression (MLR) models based on return loss plus reflectance variables were not robust, showing unstable coefficients. The most significant independent variable for estimating peach firmness is always the reflectance at 680 nm. Added to \{LR\} at 7, 9·9 and 19 GHz, the explained variance (coefficient of determination) of the firmness models reaches just 50–60%, with lower values for sugar estimation models. A low repeatability of \{LR\} was demonstrated. "

Apples were stored in normal atmosphere (NA) at 0–1 °C/90–95 \{RH\} and evaluated after 3, 6 and 9 months (after removal from cold storage plus 1, 8 and 15 d at room temperature) by descriptive sensory analysis. Fourteen of the 17 evaluated attributes, in the form of an unfolded data matrix, were subjected to principal component analysis (Tucker-1). The combination of 11 sensory attributes, which loaded heavily on PC-1, was referred to as ‘Freshness' axis. Three-way analysis of variance was applied on PC-1 scores for samples (PC-ANOVA). 1-MCP samples showed relatively low rates of juiciness, cohesiveness, hardness, crunchiness, greenness and sourness reduction during the observed period of storage as compared to Control and \{DPA\} samples. All of the evaluated 1-MCP samples practically appeared on the positive side of ‘Freshness’ axis in principal component space. The highest level of freshness loss during the storage period was observed in Control samples, which suffered changes in quality after the 9 months of storage at such a level that the fruit ware decayed and not suitable for consumption. The most resistant to scald forming were 1-MCP treated apples. No scald was found after 9 months of cold storage. The treatment of ‘Granny Smith’ apples with 1-MCP can extend the storage time in standard \{NA\} storage for at least 3 months without significantly losing freshness even two weeks after removal from cold storage, and is more effective in preserving sensory attributes related to apple freshness when compared with the \{DPA\} treatment.

This hypothesis was tested by exposing different Japanese plum (Prunus salicina Lindel.) cultivars to 0.5 μL L−1 1-MCP at 0 °C for 24 h. Following 1-MCP treatment, fruit were stored at 0 or 10 °C for 10, 20, or 30 d, respectively. A new application technology was tested by applying 1-MCP during forced-air cooling (FAC), reducing the application duration from 24 to 6 h without affecting treatment performance. This new 1-MCP application system is compatible with current postharvest handling, rendering it easily adopted by the tree fruit industry. 1-MCP had no detrimental effect on consumer acceptance of low-acid plums ripened properly prior to consumption, but it reduced the acceptance of high acidity plums. Thus, 1-MCP use on plums should avoid cultivars with high acidity and/or plums picked early when fruit have titratable acidity of 0.9% or more. 1-MCP–FAC treatment followed by storage at 10 °C is a promising new methodology to avoid chilling temperatures and provide considerable energy savings without reducing postharvest life and consumer quality of low-acid plums. Our results encourage testing this new technology at commercial scale to accurately quantify energy savings and consumer reactions for specific operations and markets. "

Ethylene and temperature conditioning have been successfully used to stimulate fruit ripening with improved eating quality over non-conditioned fruit. However, few studies have evaluated the effect of different conditioning treatments on the sensory attributes of the fruit. In this study, we compared a descriptive sensory evaluation with the chemical composition of ‘Bartlett’ pears after the fruit were exposed to the following conditioning treatments: 2 d 100 μl L−1 ethylene, 14 or 7 d at 0 °C, 7 or 3 d at 10 °C, or untreated control at 20 °C. Fruit were softened to 27, 18 and 9 N firmness before evaluation. At 9 N, fruit conditioned at 0 °C produced high levels of esters, and fruit conditioned at 0 °C for 14 d also were high in sweet taste and fruity flavor attributes. Fruit treated at 10 °C had lower concentrations of esters, but fruit treated at 10 °C for 3 d was high in sweet taste perception. Ethylene treated fruit produced low levels of esters and high levels of aldehydes and were associated with apple aroma, similar to the untreated control fruit. Water soluble pectin levels were highly and positively correlated with juiciness and sweetness and negatively correlated with firmness, crunchiness, and grittiness. Future studies should determine whether consumer liking of ‘Bartlett’ pear fruit is also influenced by conditioning treatment. "

abstract = "The ‘Hass’ avocado (Persea americana Mill.) is the most important avocado variety cultivated worldwide. To reach destination markets, long-term cold storage and transit is usually needed to reduce fruit deterioration. However, low temperatures can affect fruit quality during ripening by increasing the incidence of several physiological disorders. In this work, ‘Hass’ avocados harvested in Chile in the early summer showed more incidence of physiological disorders than fruit harvested in the spring after storage for 40 d at 5 °C. As an initial approach to understand the types of metabolism affected during ripening after low temperature exposure, a forward suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) cDNA library was constructed. A total of 117 differentially expressed genes encoding proteins involved in different biochemical pathways were identified. Genes related to stress response, protein synthesis and signal transduction were the most abundant. To corroborate our results with some of the previously found key differentially expressed genes, full length cDNA was obtained by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE-PCR). Analysis of gene expression using real-time quantitative \{PCR\} was performed. Six avocado genes relating to cell wall, sugar and lipid metabolism were analyzed: polygalacturonase (PamPG), putative NAD+-dependent sorbitol dehydrogenase (PamSDH), stearoyl-ACP desaturase (SAD) and three putative acyl-CoA synthetase (PamACoAS1, 2, 3). The expression of all genes was up-regulated after ripening, especially in avocados harvested in the spring, except for PamSAD. These results imply that these genes could be related to the loss in quality observed in the fruit from the second harvest. Further studies should be performed to identify markers for quality loss in ‘Hass’ avocados. "

Here, we have studied the differential transcript accumulation pattern and protein levels of MA-ACS1 and MA-ACO1 genes in response to ethylene, auxin, wounding and low temperature in preclimacteric banana fruit. We have shown that exogenous application of ethylene and auxin induced the expression of MA-ACS1, while MA-ACO1 showed marginal expression following ethylene treatment in preclimacteric stage. Auxin did not induce MA-ACO1 expression. Thus, auxin-treated banana fruits showed lower ethylene production rate as compared to ethylene-treated fruits. Conversely, wounding and cold treatment down-regulated the expression of both the genes and thus inhibited ethylene production. Furthermore, we have detected a GCC-box putative ethylene-responsive element (ERE)- and an auxin-responsive element (ARE)-specific DNA-binding activity in the banana pulp and studied the ethylene and auxin responsive characteristics of the GCC-box and \{ARE\} (TGTCTC) containing synthetic promoter fragments. In addition, we have detected an enhanced ethylene production rate and expression level of MA-ACS1 and MA-ACO1 genes along with a strong GCC-box-specific DNA-binding activity following exposure to constant dark period for 8 d at the preclimacteric stage. Together, our study provides interesting information about the regulation of expression of MA-ACS1 and MA-ACO1 genes in response to various factors during ripening in banana fruit, which may have physiological relevance concerning ethylene biosynthesis during post-harvest conditions.

The peel L-value continuously decreased during storage, in relation to the severity of peel browning. The peel surface morphological data indicated that the ultrastructure of longkong peel collapsed after harvest, especially around brown areas. The total phenolic content of peel tissue rapidly increased, concomitant with rapid increases in phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) activity and browning score on day 2. Tissue from the lower part of the fruit had higher total phenolic contents, as well as polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and \{PAL\} activities, compared to the top and middle parts of the fruit; however, peroxidase (POD) activity slightly changed during storage, possibly independent of phenol oxidation.

Overall, 1-MCP reduced internal ethylene production, and improved firmness and acidity retention in all apple cultivars. The addition of a second 1-MCP treatment after 4 months of \{CA\} storage further improved firmness retention in ‘McIntosh’ and late harvested ‘Empire’ apples after 7 d at room temperature. ‘Northern Spy’ apples treated with 1-MCP had lower incidence of external \{CO2\} injury, regardless of 1-MCP treatment timing. Multiple 1-MCP treatments had varying effects on the incidence of core browning; late-harvested ‘McIntosh’ treated twice with 1-MCP exhibited the highest incidence of core browning, while late-harvested ‘Empire’ treated twice had less core browning than those not treated. ‘Northern Spy’ treated only at harvest time had more core browning compared to those treated only or also after 4 months of \{CA\} storage and non-treated fruit. 1-MCP treatment had no significant effect on the incidence of internal browning in ‘McIntosh’ or ‘Empire’ apples. These results suggest that a second application of 1-MCP after 4 months of \{CA\} storage may improve firmness retention in some cultivars during holding at room temperature, but it can also have variable responses associated with susceptibility to disorders, especially when holding apples in long-term \{CA\} storage.

After irradiation all fruits were kept at 12 °C in acclimatized chamber during 14 days. After this period the fruits were brought to environmental conditions (25 °C) for around 14 more days of duration. These conditions were established to simulate the exportation conditions from Brazil to distant countries. Physical–chemical analysis (pH, titrable acidity, total soluble solids (°Brix) and texture) as well as visual observation (mass loss, rotting, internal and skin color) were evaluated. The results from this experiment could demonstrate that the characteristics of the mangoes are more dependent on time and temperature storage rather than irradiation. "

However, prolonged low-temperature storage results in the development of chilling-induced physiological disorders. Additionally, the response of avocados to cold storage depends on their stage of maturity, as late-harvest avocados are more susceptible to developing physiological disorders than those that are harvested early in the season. To understand the molecular mechanisms that cause physiological disorders in cold-stored ‘Hass’ avocados, we sought to identify and characterize the lipid metabolism-related genes. In this work, we focused our analysis on the genes that encode a multi-subunit acetyl-CoA carboxylase enzyme (MS-ACCase), which is one of the key enzymes in fatty acid biosynthesis. Two avocado MS-ACCase subunits were identified by in silico analysis, a biotin carboxylase (BC) and a biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP). Transcriptional qPCR analyses of both identified gene subunits were performed in avocados that had been harvested both early and late in the season after 40 d of storage at 0 and 5 °C and subsequent ripening at 20 °C. For both harvest dates, PamACCase-BC and PamACCase-BCCP transcripts increased in ripe fruit after cold storage at 5 °C; this increase was significant for PamACCase-BCCP. A similar expression pattern was observed in ripe avocados from early-harvested fruit after cold storage at 0 °C; however, significant down-regulation of PamACCase-BC and PamACCase-BCCP expression was observed in ripe late-harvested avocados, suggesting that these fruit have senesced. A control study involving late-harvested avocados demonstrated that the expression of these genes did not change throughout ripening. Thus we suggest that the MS-ACCase \{BCCP\} subunit might be transcriptionally regulated during physiological disorder development in cold-stored ‘Hass’ avocados. "

This study measured the effect of different colors of netting on the above and below-ground environment and apple sunburn incidence in a 3-year-old ‘Honeycrisp’ apple orchard growing in an irrigated desert climate in comparison to a traditional uncovered control. Netting did not affect air temperature or relative humidity within the orchard canopy, but reduced wind speed by 40% compared to the uncovered control. Netting reduced soil temperature and improved soil moisture at 20 and 40 cm depths throughout the study period compared to the uncovered control. Amongst different colors of netting tested in this study, pearl and blue netting significantly reduced soil temperature compared to red netting. Netting also reduced photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) by approximately 20% and strongly reduced fruit surface temperature during hot periods. During full sunlight, differences in maximum fruit surface temperature between the uncovered control and the protective netting were 2.6–4.3 °C under full sun conditions and reduced the incidence and severity of sunburn measured at harvest. As temperatures warm in the future, netting provides a viable option to mitigate some of the negative effects of excessive temperature and light on apple production in hot, dry growing regions. "

Both treatments were investigated to control Monilinia fructicola in fruit with different weights and maturity levels and in naturally infected fruit. Fruit weight only had a significant effect on microwave efficacy in ‘Placido’ peaches treated by \{MW\} at 10 kW for 95 s in which better brown rot control was observed in small than large fruit. Maturity level did not have a significant effect on efficacy of \{MW\} treatments in any of the varieties evaluated. When both \{MW\} treatments were studied in naturally infected peaches and nectarines, brown rot incidence was significantly reduced to less than 14% compared with untreated fruit where brown rot incidence was higher than 45%. The effect of both treatments on fruit quality was also evaluated. Fruit firmness was not negatively affected in the varieties tested and even a delay of fruit softening was observed. However, internal damage around the stone was observed, especially in the smallest fruit in which high temperature is achieved at the end of both \{MW\} treatments. "

Therefore the current study was conducted to investigate the effectiveness of chitosan with different molecular weights on gray mold in vitro and in vivo in tomato fruit (Solanum lycopersicum L. var. lycopersicum) stored at different temperatures. In an in vitro experiment, the results demonstrated that the antifungal activity increased as the chitosan molecular weight decreased. In an in vivo study, chitosan treatments significantly reduced fungal decay and all compounds with concentrations of 2000 and 4000 mg/L showed complete control of the fungus in wound-inoculated fruit. Chitosan with a molecular weight of 5.7 × 104 g/mol was the most effective compound among those tested. The results also revealed that high chitosan concentrations correlated with low disease incidence regardless of storage conditions. In addition to the antifungal activity, chitosan had the potential for the elicitation of defense markers, including total soluble phenolic compounds, polyphenoloxidase (PPO) activity and total protein content. Chitosan treatment decreased the activity of \{PPO\} and enhanced total protein and phenolic compounds in wounded tomato fruit. These findings suggest that the effects of chitosan with different molecular weights on gray mold in tomato fruit may be associated with direct fungitoxic properties against the pathogen, and the elicitation of biochemical defense responses in fruit.

The present study was aimed to investigate the effects of gaseous ClO2 on the redox status involved in delaying fruit senescence during storage of harvested longan fruit (Dimocarpus longan Lour. cv. Daw). Fresh longan fruit were fumigated with 10 mg/L ClO2 for 10 min, packed into cardboard boxes and stored at room temperature for 7 d. The results show that redox status of the fruit determined by ASA/DHA, GSH/GSSG and NADPH/NADP ratios decreased steadily in ClO2 untreated control group during storage. On the contrary, those ratios increased immediately after ClO2 treatment before declining steadily afterwards. The activities of NADPH-generating dehydrogenases including glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, and ASA-GSH cycle enzymes including ascorbate peroxidase, monodehydroascorbate reductase, dehydroascorbate reductase and glutathione reductase were upregulated upon the ClO2 treatment and remained stable for a few days. ClO2 treatment decreased hydrogen peroxide content and fruit senescence index, including browning and disease symptoms in pericarp during storage. It was concluded that the imbalance of redox status of ASA-GSH cascade involved senescence in ‘Daw’ longan, and ClO2 could maintain the redox balance, leading to the alleviation and delay fruit senescence.

Therefore, the analyses performed were applied on the fruits in stages: fresh, refrigerated and frozen. With regard to the bio compounds analysis, we mention: total phenolic content (TPC) expressed as g gallic acid equivalents (GAE), total flavonoid content (TFC) expressed as g of rutin equivalents (RE), and free radical scavenging activity expressed as 50% effective concentration (EC50) (mg/ml). With regard to the \{TPC\} in all analyzed storage stages have revealed ‘San Andreas’ cultivar with a maximum content of 0.326 g \{GAE\} / 100 g fresh weight (FW).

The malaxation conditions assayed using a factorial design were: time (60, 90 min), temperature (18, 30, 40 °C) and micronised talc addition (0, 1%). Olive paste from unripe Picual fruit are classified as difficult pastes. The main factor affecting oil yield was the crop year, while for each crop year the effect of each factor varied considerably. Results indicated as increasing time and temperature gave lower pomace oil losses although its effect varied on crop year. Micronised Natural Talc addition lowered pomace oil content on dry weight. Therefore for early harvesting dates knowing olive characteristics ‘on line’ is essential to adapt the kneading conditions. "

In this study, the presence and persistence of CPA-2 was monitored in the packing line, storage chambers and on working clothes by conventional PCR. After postharvest application, the presence of CPA-2 was not detectable in the environment and storage chambers, whereas on working clothes and the packing line its persistence was less than 1 and 3 days, respectively. Additionally, the CPA-2 population was quantified on oranges stored at two different temperatures (20 °C and 4 °C) by quantitative \{PCR\} (qPCR), sample pretreatment with a propidium monizade dye (PMA–qPCR) and the dilution plating method. At the initial time of the assay, no differences were observed in CPA-2 populations quantified by qPCR, PMA–qPCR, and dilution plating, at both storage temperatures. However, CPA-2 populations quantified by PMA–qPCR were significantly different compared with those obtained by qPCR during the time-course of the assay; no significant differences were observed between PMA–qPCR and dilution plating. In conclusion, the persistence of P. agglomerans CPA-2 at different sampling areas after postharvest application was low. Furthermore, PMA–qPCR gave valuable information on viable population behavior and the presence of residual \{DNA\} from dead cells. In general, these studies help to understand the persistence of antagonists when applied under postharvest conditions and will lead to optimization of time and mode of application. "

In this study, the mechanism and the potential of continuous direct-current corona discharge for the disinfection of P. expansum spores were explored. This may be a promising new technique to fight postharvest mould rots during cold storage. The changes in morphology and microstructure of P. expansum spores were characterised using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), for both untreated spores and spores subjected to this corona discharge treatment. \{SEM\} and \{TEM\} revealed noticeable defects in the morphology and internal sub-structure of the spores after treatment. The mechanisms by which the corona discharge kills P. expansum spores are suggested to be these defects. A model was developed to simulate the inactivation kinetics under various corona discharge conditions. The model comprised a set of three ordinary differential equations derived from a hypothetical three-step reaction process. The model developed described the experimentally determined inactivation kinetics of the corona discharge disinfection of P. expansum spores well (the correlation coefficients r2 exceeded 0.919 in all cases). The relationship between the reciprocal of the square root functions of the corona energy density and the time taken to inactivate 90% of the spores in a population was linear (r2 = 0.987). "

The influence of frequency (1–1800 MHz), temperature (20–60 °C) and ripening (16 days storage at 21 °C) on dielectric constant ( ɛ ′ ) and loss factor ( ɛ ″ ) was evaluated. Additionally, moisture content, soluble solids, acidity, pH, maturity index and electrical conductivity of the mango fruit after 0, 4, 8 and 16 days of storage were determined. \{DP\} values decreased with increasing frequency, but this reduction was larger for the loss factor than for the dielectric constant. Loss factor increased but dielectric constant decreased with increasing temperature. Both ɛ ′ and ɛ ″ values decreased with storage time, caused mainly by reduced moisture content and increased pH. According to calculations, \{RF\} energy at 27.12 \{MHz\} has a six times greater penetration depth in mangoes compared to \{MW\} energy at 1800 \{MHz\} at 20 °C. Values of ɛ ″ calculated from measured electrical conductivities in mango tissues matched well with the experimental ɛ ″ values at frequencies lower than 300 MHz, indicating a dominant ionic conduction effect at these frequencies. \{DP\} measurements of mangoes in storage can be useful in selecting the optimal ripening stage at which dielectric heating is suited for postharvest pest control.

Thereafter, chitosan films (medium Mw) were used in combination with 0, 10, 50 or 100 g L−1 concentrations of \{EOs\} (cinnamon, lemon, and oregano) for in vitro investigation. The use of ATR-FTIR effectively discriminated the \{EOs\} based on the energy levels of the atomic bond vibrations present, as indicated by their characteristic absorption peaks. Based on GC–MS analysis of the selected EOs, 35 volatile compounds belonging to eight different chemical classes were tentatively identified. In addition, differences in chitosan Mw were found to have significant influence on the film functional properties such as colour, thickness, contact angle, and tensile strength. Based on in vitro investigation, chitosan-oregano or −cinnamon \{EO\} films with the concentration of 10 g L−1 exhibited complete inhibitory effect against all three pathogens. Maximum inhibitory effects of chitosan-lemongrass films was dependent on \{EO\} concentration, with P. granati, Botrytis sp., and Penicillium sp. inhibited completely at 10, 50, and 50 g L−1, respectively. Antifungal in vivo study on pomegranate fruit artificially inoculated with Botrytis sp. and treated with chitosan-oregano \{EO\} (emulsions and films), showed that both treatment methods inhibited Botrytis sp. growth. However, the inhibitory effect was higher for fruit directly dipped into the chitosan-EO emulsions as opposed to samples exposed to vapour contact via the films. This study showed that chitosan-EOs applied as edible coatings or casted films can be used to control postharvest fungal pathogens associated with pomegranate fruit. "

abstract = "We have recently characterized ‘Pinalate’ (Citrus sinensis L. Osbeck), a yellow abscisic acid (ABA)-deficient mutant derived from the orange ‘Navelate’. In this study we have compared the postharvest performance of fruit of both cultivars stored at 2 and 12 °C to further understand mechanisms underlying chilling injury (CI) and non-chilling peel pitting disorders and whether deficiency in \{ABA\} may affect other quality and physiological processes in citrus fruit. The rate of dehydration in ABA-deficient fruit was higher than in its wild type ‘Navelate’. \{ABA\} levels in the flavedo of the mutant were about six-fold lower than in its parental. No changes in \{ABA\} were observed in fruit of the mutant stored at both 2 and 12 °C, while \{ABA\} increased during holding of ‘Navelate’ fruit at 12 °C and decreased at the temperature causing CI. Water, osmotic and turgor potential in the flavedo of freshly harvested fruit of both cultivars were similar and changed differentially in response to storage at 2 and 12 °C. Turgor potential was higher in ‘Pinalate’ than in ‘Navelate’ fruit held at 2 °C, probably by impaired osmotic adjustment. At 12 °C, both water and osmotic potential were lower in the ABA-deficient mutant and as a result, turgor remained constant and similar to that of ‘Navelate’ fruit. The most relevant differential feature associated with fruit quality was the higher susceptibility of ‘Pinalate’ fruit to decay and its higher loss of peel firmness during storage at 12 °C. Interestingly, fruit of the ABA-deficient mutant were more prone to develop peel pitting at non-chilling temperatures than ‘Navelate’, but more resistant to CI, which was manifested as brown non-depressed areas. A transient increase in ethylene production was observed before the appearance of both chilling and non-chilling peel pitting symptoms, suggesting that ethylene may be an indicator of the initial cell damage occurring in both citrus cultivars under postharvest conditions inducing different peel disorders. Under high rates of water loss, ethylene production was markedly enhanced in the ABA-deficient mutant, but not in ‘Navelate’ fruit, indicating that in citrus fruit, \{ABA\} may be a negative regulator of water stress-induced ethylene synthesis.

For both ethylene application times fruit exposed to 1 and 0.1 μL L−1 ethylene exhibited significant loss of firmness compared to control (0.001 μL L−1) after 2 weeks of application. Fruit exposed to 0.01 μL L−1 ethylene also softened rapidly compared to control fruit (0.001 μL L−1) when ethylene was applied at-harvest, but no substantial difference in softening was observed when applied after 10 weeks of storage. Most of the softening differentiation occurred in the first 4 weeks of exposure, after which the rates of softening returned to being relatively constant irrespective of the ethylene environment. Along with rapid softening, fruit exposed to 1 μL L−1 ethylene were higher in incidence of LTB, irrespective of exposure timing. This study demonstrates that ethylene concentrations as low as 0.01 μL L−1 can influence softening of ‘Hayward’ kiwifruit in a commercial cool storage environment. As the differentiation of treatments occurs solely in the initial period of ethylene exposure, more research is required to understand the impact of small exposure occasions, which are more likely to occur in real supply chain scenarios.

However, pericarp browning gradually appeared when ‘Nanguo’ pears were kept at 20 °C after storage for 120 and 180 d at 0 °C. In this study, changes in the browning substrate and activity of key enzyme, membrane permeability, and the extent of membrane lipid peroxidation were investigated. Changes in the activity and gene expression of enzymes involved in the membrane lipid metabolism pathway were also studied. Significantly higher polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity and lower total phenolic content were observed in fruit when browning occurred. Fruit kept for 180 d in cold storage showed a significant increase in membrane permeability and malondialdehyde (MDA) content compared to fruit stored for 60 and 120 d. This increase occurred late in cold storage and was maintained during subsequent shelf life. The activity of lipoxygenase (LOX) was remarkably increased and levels of PuPLD and PuLOX transcripts were markedly up-regulated during cold storage. During shelf life after cold storage, when pericarp browning occurred, the activities of phospholipase D (PLD) and \{LOX\} were significantly higher and expressions of PuPLD and PuLOX were significantly increased. These results indicated that the severity of pericarp browning during shelf life is related to the duration of cold storage. Pericarp browning resulted from membrane damage, possibly due to expression of PuPLD and PuLOX. "

In the dynamic test, a mechanical shaker was used to shake branches of target trees. Three trees were randomly selected for the study and each studied branch of the tested trees was divided into three response zones where one accelerometer was mounted on each zone to record the response to the input excitations. The kinetic energy induced by the input excitation in each response zone was tracked during the course of energy delivery. Results from these dynamic response tests showed that the kinetic energy delivered to an excited branch on average accounted for 60%, 77%, 92% and 95% of input excitation energy at shaking frequency of 6, 10, 14, and 18 Hz, respectively. Harvesting tests were also conducted using shaking frequencies of 14 and 18 Hz, and test trees were shaken using a sequence of four 5 s long intermittent excitations. On average, the shaker removed 67 ± 16% of the fruit during the first cycle of 18 Hz shaking, and 42 ± 16% with 14 Hz shaking. The shaker energy efficacy, defined as the percentage fruit removal per kilo-joule of input energy, was 6.9 ± 2.2% kJ−1 and 7.4 ± 1.3% kJ−1 during the first cycle of 14 and 18 Hz shaking, respectively. The results indicated that the 18 Hz shaking frequency reached higher fruit removal efficiency when compared to the 14 Hz shaking frequency with similar energy efficacy. "

Microclimatic variation exists in the ‘Nules Clementine’ mandarin tree canopy and results in lower photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) levels and temperature as well as a higher humidity inside the tree canopy. The aim of this experiment was to determine the impact of this variation in microclimate on accumulation patterns of K, Ca and Mg in the flavedo of the fruit rind during stages \{II\} and \{III\} of fruit development. Fruit mass, dimensions, rind colour development and mineral composition of the flavedo were measured to describe the condition of fruit borne on the outside and inside of the tree's canopy. The data revealed that canopy position influenced mineral nutrient accumulation patterns in the flavedo. Outside fruit flavedo accumulated significantly higher concentrations of Ca and Mg in all three seasons (2005–2007). In contrast, inside fruit flavedo (shaded fruit) accumulated significantly higher levels of K compared with outside fruit flavedo. The accumulation of K and Ca differed from that of kiwifruit and apple in that Ca concentration increased and K decreased towards maturity. These results suggest that xylem, as in citrus leaves, is the main vasculature supply conduit to the citrus fruit flavedo for mineral nutrients. The reduction of transpiration potential by lower temperatures and higher humidity inside the canopy could be responsible for the reduced accumulation of Ca and Mg. The high K concentration of inside fruit flavedo is suggested to be a stress response, due to the low light levels, to maintain osmotic potential in the shaded rind tissue, and this imbalance could possibly lead to a reduction in rind condition, which manifests through rind breakdown symptom development.

The model cationic compound Methylene Blue (MB) was incorporated in different positions of the nanolayered coating and its loading and release behavior was evaluated. UV–VIS spectroscopy and quartz crystal microbalance analysis showed that the amount of \{MB\} loaded increased with the distance from the first layer, suggesting that the \{MB\} was able to diffuse into the κ-carrageenan/chitosan nanolayered coating and not only adhered to the surface of the layer immediately below it. For most of the tested conditions, the \{MB\} release from the κ-carrageenan/chitosan nanolayered coatings was successfully described by the linear superimposition model, which allowed concluding that \{MB\} transport is due to both concentration gradient and the polymer relaxation of the nanolayers. However, depending on temperature and pH of the medium and on the position of \{MB\} incorporated on the nanolayered coatings, different mechanisms prevail. Industrial relevance The development of novel edible coatings with improved functionality and performance for e.g. fresh and minimally processed fruits is one of the challenges of the post-harvest industry. This work contributes to the understanding of the loading and release phenomena involved in structures at the nano-scale, which is useful for the development of bioactive compounds release systems for application in food industry.

A few yeast-based biocontrol products are either in advanced stages of development or commercially available. Ecological fitness, stress tolerance and biocontrol performance are essential attributes for yeasts used as biocontrol agents. In the present study, a mild heat shock (HS, 40 °C for 30 min) pretreatment of the biocontrol yeast, Rhodotorula mucilaginosa, increased its tolerance to subsequent high temperature (48 °C), oxidative stress (70 mM H2O2), salt stress (3 M NaCl), and low pH (pH 4). Activation of the yeast antioxidant system by \{HS\} resulted in a lower accumulation of reactive oxygen species and less oxidative damage to proteins and lipids relative to control yeast cells when both were subjected to various abiotic stresses. Additionally, HS-treated yeast exhibited increased efficacy in controlling infection of apple fruit by Penicillium expansum, and a higher growth rate in apple wounds. These results suggest that stress adaptation is a viable approach for improving the efficacy of yeast biocontrol agents under the variable environmental conditions that exist in the postharvest environment of packing houses and storage facilities.

This procedure also provides some knowledge on several experimental factors (ripeness stages, storage time and storage temperature) with regard to the onset of woolliness. It is confirmed through this study that, in cv. Maycrest peaches, woolliness starts to appear after 2 weeks of storage at 5°C. Fruits classified at harvest in ‘first’ and ‘second’ ripeness stages are more susceptible to woolliness than those in the third ripeness stage.

For three years (2004, 2005 and 2006), three fruit samples were taken over the entire production period: at the beginning of harvest [16 weeks after transplanting (WAT)], at mid-harvest (26 WAT), and at the end of harvest (35 WAT). Values for temperature, solar radiation, and \{VPD\} peaked in the third sampling in both greenhouses during the three years, being higher in the parral greenhouse during the production cycle. No-market production and peroxidation indicators [measured as \{H2O2\} and malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations] significantly increased at the end of the productive period in both greenhouses, indicating the presence of oxidative stress caused by the rise in temperature, solar radiation, and VPD, which was more pronounced in the parral greenhouse. Water-soluble pectins, pectate, and protopectin contents were measured, revealing an increase in the former two and a reduction in the latter under environmental stress. This indicates a clear pectin solubilization in cherry tomato fruit. The enzymes pectolytic polyglacturonase (PG), pectin methylesterase (PME), and pectate lyase (PEL), altered their activities during the third sampling, while the calcium concentration fell drastically. Therefore, both the increase in pectin solubilization as well as the reduction in the Ca concentration during harshest environmental stress in the third sampling, especially in the parral greenhouse, could degenerate the textural properties of the cherry tomato, reducing its quality and consumer acceptance.

By means of both conducted and previously published morello harvested experiments, it is established that under different harvest conditions and characteristics of the vibratory impact on a fruit-bearing tree, the relative quantity of the non-detached fruit from the tree and the probability for non-sufficient harvest duration are coincident and both decrease exponentially when the vibratory impact duration for the tree increases. Tests of the concordance between the experimental data and the statistical hypothesis for exponential probability distribution of the harvest duration show that at the 0·01 level of significance, the experimental data does not contradict the raised hypothesis.

In this paper, we studied dehydrin isoform patterns, dehydrin gene expression and trehalose levels in the skin of Cardinal (Vitis vinifera L.) table grapes, along with their regulation by different cold postharvest storage conditions. Immunoanalysis with K-segment antibody recognizes four constitutive dehydrins (from 17 to 44 kDa) that are tightly regulated by low temperature and high CO2. Phosphatase treatment showed that \{DHN44\} and \{DHN22\} isoforms are phosphorylated polypeptides, while MALDI-TOF \{MS\} and MS/MS analysis suggested that 44 kDa polypeptide may be a dehydrin homodimer. At the transcriptional level, dehydrins are also regulated by low temperature and high CO2, showing a fairly good correlation with their mRNA levels. Trehalose was quantified by high performance anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC–PAD), revealing a progressive increase of this metabolite throughout storage at 0 °C and the sudden transitory increases in short-term high CO2-treated fruit. We propose that the constitutive presence and up-regulation of dehydrins and trehalose during low temperature postharvest storage could be positively correlated with the relative chilling tolerance of table grapes and the adaptive responses activated by high \{CO2\} levels to preserve cell water status and to counteract the disruption of physiological processes during cold storage.

abstract = "Abstract The aim of our study was to assess differences in the expression of genes involved in fruit softening and ethylene biosynthetic pathways under different temperature storage conditions. Different peach cultivars of ‘Xiacui’ and ‘Yumyeong’, which are stonyhard, ‘Yinhualu’, which is soft-melting, ‘Hujing Milu’, which is hard-melting, and ‘Baby Gold 6’, which is non-melting at 80% ripening, were collected as test materials. The results showed that only slight ethylene production was detected after harvesting of ‘Yumyeong’ and ‘Xiacui’ under either a room temperature (25 °C) or low temperature (4 °C). The fruit firmness of stonyhard cultivars was retained at a high level under room temperature over time, whereas a low temperature induced ‘Yumyeong’ fruit to soften. Quantitative real-time \{PCR\} results indicated that the PpACS1 gene was highly expressed in soft-melting, hard-melting and non-melting cultivars; however, expression was extremely low in stonyhard peaches. PpACS2 or PpACS3, however, was not detected in all five cultivars. Interestingly, cold treatment significantly decreased firmness along with endo-PG expression obviously up-regulated in ‘Yumyeong’, but not in ‘Xiacui’ peaches. In conclusion, this study revealed that fruit softening of peaches with different flesh textures was closely related to ethylene biosynthesis during the storage period, which was controlled via regulating relevant gene expression levels under different storage temperatures.

abstract = "Abstract Southern hemisphere blueberry producers often export their products through extended supply chains to Northern hemisphere consumers. During extended storage, small variations in temperature or atmosphere concentrations may generate significant differences in final product quality. In addition, relatively short delays in establishing cool storage temperatures may contribute to quality loss. In these experiments a full factorial analysis was done of the effects of three cooling delays (0, 12 or 24 h at 10 °C), three atmosphere concentrations (air, 10% \{CO2\} + 2.5% \{O2\} and 10% \{CO2\} + 20% O2) and two storage temperatures (0 °C and 4 °C) which were assessed for their impact on final quality, measured as weight loss, firmness and rot incidence. Two blueberry cultivars were studied: ‘Brigitta’, a highbush cultivar, and ‘Maru’, a rabbiteye. Delays in cooling had a small effect on final product weight, whereas variation in storage temperature and atmosphere during simulated transport influenced both firmness and rot incidence. Atmospheres with 10% \{CO2\} reduced decay incidence, particularly at low oxygen concentration (2.5% O2), although the latter conditions tended to soften fruit. In order to achieve optimal postharvest storage for blueberries, minimising temperature variability in the supply chain is important, as is finding the potentially cultivar-specific optimal combination of high \{CO2\} and low \{O2\} concentration that results in simultaneously minimising rot incidence and induced softening.

The objective of this work was to investigate the effect of 1-MCP (625 nL L−1) and 3 different maturity stages (early, middle and late harvest date) on the incidence and development of physiological disorders and ripening delay during storage at 0.5 °C and subsequent shelf-life at room temperature ≈ 22 °C, in ‘Golden Delicious’ apples. Fruit were collected in 6 orchards at a weekly interval, and half were treated with 1-MCP after 3 d cold storage, and the other half left as control. Quality parameters were evaluated at harvest, after 1-MCP treatment and after 6 months storage as well as after 7 d shelf-life. 1-MCP treatment of ‘Golden Delicious’ was effective for slowing softening, reduce electrolyte leakage and color changes associated with ripening (lightness and hue parameters), did not affect soluble solids content and had no clear effect on fruit phenols and antioxidant activity. 1-MCP inhibited superficial scald and significantly reduced rot; however, this treatment enhanced the development of bitter pit in some orchards. Harvest date did not influence scald, bitter pit and firmness but decreased weight loss, total phenols, soluble solid content and antioxidant activity from 2nd to 3rd harvest. The application of 1-MCP, 3 d after cold storage, to ‘Golden Delicious’ apples, reduced ripening and superficial scald, did not induce diffuse skin browning, but increased bitter pit incidence. "

To determine this ‘W. Murcott Afourer’ mandarins were stored for either 6 weeks at a continuous 5 °C or held at 20 °C for either 1 or 2 weeks following 0, 2 or 4 weeks of 5 °C storage. Sensory quality as measured by likeability was maintained throughout the 6 week storage when the fruit were kept at 5 °C, but rapidly declined upon moving fruit to 20 °C. Flavor loss increased as the duration of cold storage prior to the warm temperature holding period was lengthened. The beneficial effect of maintaining mandarins in cold storage was also observed in three of the five other varieties where there was flavor quality loss during storage at a warmer temperature. Soluble solids concentration (SSC) and titratable acidity (TA) were relatively unchanged by holding at 20 °C, but aroma volatiles, with alcohols and ethyl esters being of the greatest importance, were greatly enhanced in concentration and are the likely cause of the off-flavor. The increases in aroma volatile concentration were apparent within one day of holding the fruit at 20 °C, indicating the need to carefully control postharvest storage temperatures. A comparison of 5, 10 and 20 °C holding indicated that it is only at 20 °C that aroma volatiles contributing to off-flavor accumulated. This study suggests that it may be possible in many mandarin varieties to prevent losses in flavor quality by maintaining the fruit at a cold temperature (5–10 °C) following packing and until the time of consumption.

Finite element models are used to analyse the dynamic process of the collision of apple fruit amongst each other or with rigid walls. The major objective was to use these models to investigate the collision of apples in conditions that closely resemble typical practical collision regimes of such fruit during unit operations such as transportation in trucks, sorting operations or any other handling operations. Specifically, information on the quantity of energy loss that can be attributed to the excitation of elastic waves within the body was assessed in isolation to energy dissipation due to the viscoelastic nature of the material. Viscous dissipation effects of the fruit collisions are also studied. In particular, an assessment of two different methods of determining the effective viscous coefficient for a collision involving two viscoelastic objects (namely, the sum of inverses method and the arithmetic mean method) is carried out. For soft and relatively large objects such as the apple, the absorption of dynamic waves excited during collisions can lead to substantial kinetic energy losses. Amount of energy loss is dependent on the elastic properties of the material, the geometrical size of the colliding objects as well as the collision velocity. The currently available techniques for obtaining the viscoelastic properties of fruit using the stress relaxation experiments are not suitable for providing the characterization needed to describe the very short term processes such as collisions. The arithmetic mean method advocated by some researchers to determine the effective viscous coefficient during the collision of objects of different viscous properties is not appropriate. A more theoretically accurate assessment of the problem is necessary. "

Treated and control fruit were then transferred either to a growth chamber at 25 °C or to a cold room at 4 °C for 3 days. At the end of treatment with 1-MCP; ethylene production in control fruit had increased relative to production at harvest, and this rise was abolished by the presence of the chemical. Moreover, treated fruit showed lower soluble solids content (SSC) and higher \{FF\} and titratable acidity (TA) compared to control ones, and putrescine and spermine levels were moderately enhanced in the mesocarp at the end of treatment. In contrast with the inhibition of ethylene production, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase (ACS) and especially 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase (ACO1 and ACO2) transcript levels were enhanced relative to controls. During storage, 1-MCP affected ethylene production and biosynthetic gene expression, fruit softening and other quality parameters in a temperature-dependent manner: in fruit held at 25 °C a strong decrease in ethylene production, a delay in ripening and lower \{ACS\} and ACO1/ACO2 levels were recorded, while in fruit held at 4 °C an opposite trend was observed. Results suggest that 1-MCP application followed by storage at 25 °C appears effective in controlling postharvest ripening. The lack of efficacy of the chemical in cold-stored fruit is discussed in relation to changes in \{SAMDC\} gene expression and putrescine accumulation in treated fruit relative to controls, which may be part of a stress response.

We measured the soluble sugars and organic acids concentrations in different tissues of Shatian pumelo (Citrus grandis), Guanxi pumelo (C. grandis) and Hirado Butun pumelo (HBP; C. grandis × Citrus paradisi) stored at ambient temperature (10–16 °C) by gas chromatography and high-performance capillary electrophoresis. During storage, organic acids and soluble sugars concentrations in the pulp fluctuated significantly instead of simply decreasing or increasing. The variations in citric, malic, aconitic and fumaric acid concentrations showed no substantial difference as did fluctuations in sucrose, fructose and glucose concentrations. In the pulp, the concentration of sucrose was a little higher than, or close to, that of glucose and fructose. However, the sucrose concentration in the pericarp was much lower than that of glucose and fructose. In the pulp of HBP, the change trend of sucrose concentration was opposite that of organic acid concentration after storage for 20 days post harvest (DPH). Sugar/acid ratios in \{HBP\} and Shatian pumelo increased with the storage time, while they decreased in Guanxi pumelo. The total concentration of soluble sugar decreased slightly in the pulp, but sucrose concentration decreased significantly (except in the Shatian pumelo); while in the pericarp, the total soluble sugar concentration showed a dramatic decreasing trend, indicating that carbohydrate transport from the pulp to pericarp or carbohydrate redistribution might occur in postharvest citrus fruit.

Consumers increasingly perceive fresh food as healthier than heat-treated food, which motivates a general search for new minimally fresh processed fruit and vegetables. However, despite the benefits derived from eating fresh foods, safety is still an issue of concern owing to a wide range of documented cases of contaminated fresh fruits and vegetables, which have caused large outbreaks of microbial infections. Minimally fresh processed fruit and vegetables are very perishable products, highly susceptible to deterioration, and minimal processing reduced shelf life leading to additional quality losses. Therefore, the derived processed produces are in fact more sensitive to disorders than the original ones. Many factors affect the shelf-life and microbial quality of raw prepared fruit and vegetables, and include good agricultural practices, good hygienic practices during harvesting and handling, quality of washing water, processing technologies, packaging methods and materials, and processing, storage, transportation, distribution and retail sale temperatures. Common practices consist of the protection of the produce from damage caused by poor handling or machinery, foreign body contamination, and/or pest infestation. "

The mathematical functions that better fit for the production obtained with the water volume received were linearism, but the functions of evapotranspiration (ET) and yield were second-degree polynomials. The water use efficiency (WUE) and irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) decreased with the increase of irrigation water applied from stem fruiting to the end, significantly since harvest of zenith fruits. But \{WUE\} and \{IWUE\} were ascending with the increase of irrigation water from cucumber field setting to first fruit ripening. Well irrigation along the whole cycle was a clearly advisable irrigation regime. On the other hand, the least advisable regimes were those that lead to deficiencies from harvest of the first fruit to the zenith fruits.

For constructing a model, firmness was considered to be built up by a variable part (e.g. pectin based firmness) that changes according to a first order reaction mechanism and a fixed part (e.g. cellulose or structure based firmness) that is invariable under the circumstances under study. The firmness of the tomato slices decreased exponentially during storage, with a reference rate constant of 0.0975 ± 0.0183 J/mol/K for the outer pericarp and 0.0712 ± 0.0328 J/mol/K for the radial pericarp and energy of activation of 87.5 and 94.8 kJ/mol, respectively for outer and radial pericarp. The parameters of the model were estimated using multiple variate non-linear regression analysis with time, temperature and stage of ripening of the fruit at harvest simultaneously as explanatory variables. To combine the information on firmness behaviour during the preharvest and the postharvest period at different temperatures, it was assumed that the process of firmness loss during ripening was the same whether the fruit ripened on the plant or off-vine. So, the initial firmness at the postharvest period depends on the time the tomatoes were allowed to ripen on the plant (stage of ripening). The statistical analysis of the mean values of firmness provided a percentage variance which accounted for 92% and 72% for outer and radial pericarp, respectively. Using a fundamental approach to build the reported model and using all available data and information made it possible to describe and simulate the firmness behaviour of tomato slices as a function of the stage of ripening and the applied storage temperature.

One potential physical method for reducing fungal decay is application of a short-term hypobaric treatment prior to storage. In this study efficacy of postharvest hypobaric treatments to control natural rot development in strawberries was evaluated. Strawberries were treated with hypobaric pressures (25 kPaa, 50 kPaa and 75 kPaa) for 4 h at 20 °C and subsequently stored at 20 °C or 5 °C. A 50 kPaa treatment consistently delayed rot development in samples stored at either temperature confirming that the technique has potential as a non-chemical treatment. Moreover 50 kPaa treatments did not affect weight loss and firmness at either 20 °C or 5 °C. An initial increase in respiration rate was observed in 50 kPaa treated samples potentially indicating mild stress due to hypobaric treatment. An in vitro fungal study found that 50 kPaa treatment for 4 h did not affect the rate of radial growth of colonies of Botrytis cinerea and Rhizopus stolonifer, providing further evidence that the potential mechanism of hypobaric treatment is induction of the defence system within the fruit rather than a direct effect on fungal viability. Further molecular and biochemical research is required to evaluate the possible stimulation of resistance in fruit through short-term hypobaric treatments. "

The study was conducted aiming to identify the disease causal agents at species level, investigate the aggressiveness of Alternaria spp. isolates and the susceptibility of different apple varieties and determine the mycotoxigenic potential of Alternaria spp. isolates from apple fruit. Seventy-five Alternaria spp. isolates obtained from apple fruit showing core rot symptoms were identified as either Alternaria tenuissima or Alternaria arborescens at frequencies of 89.3 and 11.7%, respectively, based on the sequence of endopolygalacturonase (EndoPG) gene. Artificial inoculations of fruit of 4 different varieties (Fuji, Golden Delicious, Granny Smith and Red Delicious) and incubation at two different temperatures (2 and 25 °C) showed that fruit of Fuji variety were the most susceptible and fruit of Golden Delicious the most resistant to both pathogens. In addition, the production of 3 mycotoxins, alternariol (AOH), alternariol monomethyl ether (AME) and tentoxin (TEN) was investigated in 30 isolates of both species. Mycotoxin determination was conducted both in vitro, on artificial nutrient medium and in vivo on artificially inoculated apple fruit, using a high performance liquid chromatography with diode array detector (HPLC-DAD). The results showed that most of the isolates of both species were able to produce all the 3 metabolites both in vivo and in vitro. On apple fruit A. tenuissima isolates produced more \{AOH\} than A. arborescens isolates, whereas the latter produced more \{TEN\} than the former. Such results indicate that Alternaria core rot represents a major threat of apple fruit production not only due to quantitative yield losses but also for qualitative deterioration of apple by-products.

The core concept as the basis of \{IGS\} is ‘Speaking plant approach (SPA)’, which was originally proposed by Udink ten Cate et al. and Hashimoto who is a professor emeritus at Ehime University. The \{SPA\} concept defines that optimal crop cultivation conditions should be based on the physiological status of the plants. The first step of the \{SPA\} is to obtain physiological information from a living plant. As a successful example, a chlorophyll fluorescence imaging robot, which can be used to grasp theheterogeneous distribution of photosynthetic activity of tomato plants in a greenhouse, is introduced. The primary feature of this robot is the feasible design, automated simple operation and low-cost, for implementation in commercial tomato production greenhouses. In addition, it is also focusing on the development of postharvest management techniques to improve the fruit quality. Here, a study to investigate the effects of storage temperature on the color of tomato fruit would be briefly introduced. "

abstract = "One of the major causes of ‘Fuyu’ persimmon loss after cold storage (CS) is the breakdown of its flesh, which results in the production of a translucent fruit (a water-soaked fruit). It is believed that the cause of this disturbance is linked to disorganization of the cytoskelet and endomembrane system, which changes the synthesis and transport of proteins and metabolites, resulting in incomplete ripening. To test this hypothesis, ‘Fuyu’ persimmon was subjected to three different postharvest treatments (T): Control – harvested and kept at 23 ± 3 °C and relative humidity (RH) of 85 ± 5% (room temperature, RT) for 12 days, \{T1\} – harvested and kept under cold storage (CS) (1 ± 1 °C and \{RH\} of 85 ± 5%) for 30 days followed by \{RT\} storage for 2 days, \{T2\} – kept under \{RT\} for 2 days (acclimatization) followed by \{CS\} for 30 days. Control and \{T2\} resulted in fruit with decreased flesh firmness (FF), and increased soluble solids (SS) and ascorbic acid (AA) contents. In these fruit the activity of endo-1,4-ß-glucanase (endo-1,4-ß-gluc), pectin methylesterase (PME), polygalacturonase (PG) and ß-galactosidase (ß-gal) increased. \{T1\} resulted in translucent fruit with decreased FF, without any enzymatic activity changes, probably due to the physical disruption of the cytoskeleton. Further, there was an increased content of proteins corresponding to expansins in fruit kept under Control and \{T2\} conditions, which suggests that these conditions do contribute to the synthesis and/or transport of proteins involved in the process of solubilization of the cell wall. In these fruit, there was also a major accumulation of gene transcripts corresponding to heat shock proteins (HSPs) of organelles related to endomembrane, which suggests participation of these genes in the prevention of damage caused by cold conditions. These data proved the hypotheses that acclimatization contributes to the expression of HSPs, and synthesis and transportat of proteins involved in the solubilization of the cell wall. The expression of these genes results in the normal ripening of the persimmon, as confirmed by the evolution of ethylene production. "

The mechanisms involved in the tolerance of citrus fruit to these postharvest physiological disorders and how they are related to each other are not well understood. In the present work, we have examined changes in the activities of the antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and glutathione reductase (GR), and of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), the initial rate-controlling enzyme in phenolic synthesis, in ‘Navelate’ oranges and in its yellow abscisic acid-deficient mutant ‘Pinalate’ in relation to their susceptibility to chilling injury (CI) and to non-chilling peel pitting. ‘Navelate’ oranges developed \{CI\} during storage at 2 °C and very slight postharvest non-chilling peel pitting at 12 °C. By contrast, ‘Pinalate’ fruit did not show \{CI\} and were more susceptible to non-chilling peel pitting than ‘Navelate’ fruit. No important differences in the activities of the enzymes \{GR\} and \{APX\} were found in fruit of both phenotypes when stored at 2 °C or 12 °C. By contrast, ‘Pinalate’ fruit, the chilling-tolerant cultivar, had higher \{CAT\} activity than ‘Navelate’ oranges during storage at 2 °C, while it was lower at the temperature causing non-chilling peel pitting. \{PAL\} activity barely changed in response to cold stress in the mutant but increased in the chilling-susceptible ‘Navelate’ fruit. On the other hand, the increase in \{PAL\} occurring in ‘Pinalate’ fruit at 12 °C might be associated with their greater development of non-chilling peel pitting. The overall results indicate that the enzyme \{PAL\} might be a good biochemical marker for both chilling-induced superficial scald and non-chilling peel pitting and that \{CAT\} may play a role protecting ‘Navelate’ and ‘Pinalate’ fruit from conditions favoring both physiological disorders. In addition, \{SOD\} could be involved in the higher tolerance of ‘Navelate’ oranges to develop non-chilling peel pitting. "

Fruit growth was sigmoidal with a strong decline in growth rate after the onset of peel colour change. The first change in peel colour was recorded 24–25 days after anthesis in H. undatus and 26–27 days in H. polyrhizus. In both species, the peel turned fully red 4–5 days after the first colour change (mean temperature for the study period was 26.6±2.1°C). The slow growth phase was characterised by a decrease in the proportion of peel and concomitant increase in that of pulp, increase in the concentration of soluble solids and soluble sugars and a decline in firmness and the concentration of starch and mucilage. The surge in acidity prior to colour change indicated the beginning of the ripening processes. For H. polyrhizus, which has a red–violet pulp, the increase in pulp pigment paralleled the development of peel colour. Fruits were non-climacteric, and when harvested at close to full colour, they retained market quality for at least 2 weeks at 14°C or 1 week at 20°C. Storage at 6°C is not recommended, because transfer from that temperature to room conditions caused fruits to lose their firmness and flavour rapidly. "

The effect of chitosan/nano-silica coating on chilling tolerance in white-flesh loquat fruit (cv Baiyu) stored at 5 °C for 40 d was investigated. In comparison with control fruit, internal browning and weight loss in chitosan/nano-silica treated fruit were significantly delayed. Likewise, the decrease of total soluble solids (TSS) and titratable acidity (TA) was also inhibited. Glucose and fructose contents increased from 11.31 to 12.76 g kg−1 and from 33.20 to 44.37 g kg−1, respectively. The increase of reducing sugars contributed to the improvement of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activities, reaching the peaks of 623510.12, 462371.21 and 41114.35 U kg−1, respectively. Enhanced activities of antioxidant enzymes markedly alleviated the generation of superoxide anion (O2−) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Low levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and membrane permeability in chitosan/nano-silica treated fruit were also detected, ranged from 4.35 to 8.31 mmol kg−1 and from 24.32 to 43.45%, respectively. Moreover, activities of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), polyphenoloxidase (PPO) and lipoxidase (LOX) were also much lower than those in treatment alone and control fruit. Our results indicated that the use of chitosan/nano-silica coating was effective in enhancing chilling tolerance and providing a longer storage life with acceptable external and internal quality in loquat fruit.

At the DC, 2 d after harvest, cucumbers were sorted and either commercially machine packaged in expanded polystyrene trays covered with a polyvinylchloride film or remained unpackaged for bulk retail display. Cucumbers were transported the next day by truck to a retail store in Gainesville, collected from the store, and stored under optimum (10 °C and 90% RH) or simulated retail display conditions (4 °C or 14 °C and 90–92% RH). Sensory (visual and instrumental color, firmness, shriveling, chilling injury and decay) and compositional quality (pH, titratable acidity, soluble solids and chlorophyll contents) were evaluated initially at the \{DC\} and after a 4-d simulated retail display period. Overall, bulk cucumbers were softer, appeared more shriveled, and were more affected by pitting and decay than packaged cucumbers. Bulk cucumbers also appeared lighter green and more yellowish than packaged fruit. Hue angle was less in bulk than in packaged cucumbers, but no consistent differences were observed in the L*, chroma, and hue values between the different temperatures. Small variations in the L*, hue, and chroma values compared to significant losses in chlorophyll content suggest that insufficient chlorophyll degradation occurred to cause major visual color changes. The greater weight loss in bulk cucumbers compared to packaged fruit was associated with accelerated chlorophyll degradation, lower acidity, and lower soluble solids content. Although packaged cucumbers had better visual quality than bulk cucumbers, there was higher \{RH\} inside the packages and greater development of decay on packaged fruit. Overall, after the 4-d simulated retail display, the appearance of the cucumbers used in this study was considered to be objectionable due to either yellowing, loss of firmness, shriveling or decay, regardless of the treatment. Results from this study demonstrate the importance of using an appropriate protective package in addition to maintaining the optimum temperature during distribution and retail display. Moreover, initial quality evaluation should be performed upon reception at the DC, and before cucumbers are displayed at the retail store, in order to estimate the remaining shelf life before this product becomes unacceptable for sale.

We describe the morphological changes occurring in ageing mushrooms and find that signs of senescence become visible around day 18; they steadily increase in amplitude towards the end of the fruit bodies' life. Cytologically, karyolysis and focal cytoplasmolysis were the first signs followed by indications of an increased permeability of the cytoplasmic membranes and by structural changes of the cell wall. These changes result in extracellular aggregations of the lytic cell remains encapsulating or bridging the hyphal cells. Cells of the stipe tissues were transformed to empty cylinders or had irregularly collapsed. Most basidia and subhymenial cells remained alive even on day 36. When the mushrooms were cultivated according to our usual growth procedures, about 50% of the fruit bodies were infected by Trichoderma harzianum and/or Pseudomonas tolaasii on day 18; all fruit bodies died on day 24 due to diffuse bacterial and mycotic infections manifesting themselves by tissue necrosis and discoloration of the caps and stipes. When none of the fruit bodies was harvested at the time of the first flush they soon formed a canopy of pilei and their growth ceased. On day 14, all these fruit bodies showed widespread mixed infections followed by a diffuse liquefaction necrosis of all tissues including the hymenium. Post-harvest fruit bodies kept at ambient temperature or at 2°C at low r.h., or at 20° at high r.h. revealed a diffuse cell wall destruction which was followed by cytoplasmic degeneration in due course. Fruit bodies kept refrigerated had the least gross and cell structural changes during our observation period of 7 d. We conclude that the morphological changes occurring in post-harvest and in senescent fruit bodies of Agaricus bisporus are different. "

In this study six varieties of pitahaya, having white, pink, and red internal flesh coloration, were harvested and evaluated for sensory and quality attributes at harvest and following storage for two weeks at either 5 °C or 10 °C. Storage did not influence overall visual liking or color of the external portion of the fruit as discerned by the panelists. Alterations in the internal flesh color, such as a slight darkening, were noted to occur by instrumental measurement, but these differences were not noticeable to the panelists. Losses in sugars and acids occurred in the flesh during storage at both storage temperatures and were related to declines in fructose, glucose and malic acid. In contrast, antioxidant activity was reduced by storage at 5 °C but was unchanged at 10 °C, with betacyanin concentration not differing from that determined at harvest. Aldehydes were the most abundant aroma volatiles detected in juice from the flesh, with storage increasing total aldehyde amount, particularly at 10 °C. Total alcohols, on the other hand, were reduced by storage, the amount of reduction not dependent on storage temperature. Regardless of the storage-induced changes in the various components measured, panelists did not report any significant differences in overall liking, flavor, sweetness, tartness or texture. There were substantial varietal differences in sensory and quality attributes, regardless of the impact of storage. ‘Cebra’ had very low sweetness relative to the other varieties and had low flavor and overall liking scores. Panelist perception of flavor quality was most closely linked with varietal differences in \{SSC\} and TA, although there were clear differences in aroma volatiles as well. Mexicana, a white-fleshed variety, had the lowest antioxidant activity, corresponding to low amounts of the red betacyanin pigments. The study indicated that storage, and particularly that at 10 °C, caused a variety of measureable changes in a range of pitahaya quality parameters but that these changes did not substantially alter the sensory quality of the fruit. Further research is needed to determine whether or not varietal or storage-induced differences in aroma volatile content have an impact on pitahaya flavor. "

Examples of the quantification of deterioration due to temperature fluctuations, pathogen attack and mechanical energy inputs are given. Interactions between these primary factors are also considered. As fruit and vegetables move through the distribution system the total quality deterioration can be determined at all times from the contributions of the primary factors and their interactions. A plot of deterioration against time is given, showing how various management strategies can be assessed by comparing total deterioration against acceptable limits, thus forming a basis for management action to either sell quickly or to introduce post-harvest controls.

abstract = "The feasibility of radio frequency (RF) selective heating as a disinfestation technique was investigated, considering rusty grain beetle in bulk wheat samples at 27.12 MHz. Although pesticides and fumigants are the most commonly used methods for controlling insects in postharvest products such as grains, nuts, and fruits, they pose a direct threat to human health and the environment. In this work, power dissipation factors and the rate of increase of temperature in the insect bodies and wheat kernels were considered to assess the effectiveness of the proposed method. Dielectric and other physical properties of the insect and wheat were measured, and the electric field intensities in the system were estimated using an electromagnetic model. The host grain at three levels of moisture contents, 12%, 15%, 18% wet weight basis, were included to cover a wide range of grain storage scenarios, and the dielectric properties were measured at temperatures between 15 °C and 75 °C. The ratios of electric field intensity ( E i 2 / E g 2 ) and dielectric loss factor ( ε i ″ / ε g ″ ) within the insect bodies to that in grain kernels ranged from 0.13 to 0.76 and from 8.61 to 169.93 respectively. The latter had a significant effect on insect-to-wheat power absorption factor, Pig, which varied between 5 and 40. The relative rate of increase of temperature for insect-to-wheat was directly related to Pig, but inversely related to the product of insect/grain specific heat and density, which varied between 0.89 and 1.33, and was therefore almost identical to Pig, and ranged from 6.47 to 29.6. This large relative rate of increase of temperature in insect bodies compared to wheat may have potential benefits in heating the insects selectively with radio frequency energy to their lethal temperature while keeping the host grain at moderate temperature, and therefore minimising or eliminating adverse effects on its physicochemical properties.

Batsch, cv. Flordastar. Even though crop load did not affect plant water status, the \{MDS\} and \{TGR\} values increased and decreased, respectively, as a result of the crop load effect. In this sense, for the same Ψstem value, there was a linear increase in \{MDS\} with crop load, with a slope of 6.6 μm MPa−1 per unit of crop load increment. The effects of environmental conditions on daily \{MDS\} values were also dependent on crop load, suggesting that \{MDS\} reference values should be obtained by representing the relations between \{MDS\} and the climatic variables (daily mean air temperature, daily mean vapour pressure deficit and daily crop reference evapotranspiration) for a given crop load. The constancy of the relation between \{MDS\} and Ψstem across crop load underlined the constancy of the elastic properties of the bark tissues. "

Green or deep green harvested fruit failed to fully colour red, while fruit that were harvested at or after the colour break stage visually completed their red colour development within 7–9 days. However, the colour intensity of spice powder was low for all fruit that had not developed a deep red colour prior to harvest. For paprika no difference between deep red fruit that were succulent or that had partially dried on the plant was found, but chilli fruit that had partially dried before harvest produced the most intense colour. American Spice Trade Association (ASTA) extractable red colour was the best measure of spice colour quality, compared to reflected lightness (L*), chroma (C*) and hue angle (h°) colour measurements. Pungency did not change between ripeness stages for chilli and was absent in paprika. Paprika and chilli fruit showed climacteric behaviour as long as they were attached to the plant, but when detached were non-climacteric. "

Economically these fruits are the major component in the feeding systems of high-quality domestic pigs. As in most Quercus species, the chief feature of holm-oak acorn production is its high variability among individuals and years. Many hypotheses have been put forward to explain these fluctuations, but the variables influencing this alternating behavior remain unknown. From 1998 to 2003 we studied floral phenology, fruit production, fruit size, airborne pollen emission and meteorology in a holm-oak natural area of South Spain. The results obtained by using a Principal Components Factorial Analysis indicated that pollen emission, up to the day where maximum pollen data are recorded, was the most important factor determining final acorn harvest. With regard to the influence of the weather, temperature, relative humidity and rainfall of January, March and September were the most influencing variables. Our results support the “wind pollination” hypothesis proposed by other authors in some North-American Quercus studies. Integration of aerobiological, field phenological and meteorological data could represent an important step forward in forest fruit production research. "

Cone weight at harvest (CW) and in-shell pine nut number per cone (IS) were measured on 76 superior trees. Climatic and biometeorological variables, defined based on 11 physio-phenological reproductive phases, were related to fruit production traits. Results showed marked differences among North, South and Dry coast areas. The highest values of cone productivity (32 kg tree−1) and \{CN\} (62 cones tree−1) were recorded in the South. Stone pine cone production throughout Chile was favored by spring minimum temperature above 7 °C; annual thermal oscillation below 12 °C and late summer temperature below 6 °C during differentiation of reproductive shoots; and a high spring rainfall, except during male flowering period. Accumulated rainfall above 14 mm during 2 year-old conelet growth produced heavier cones. \{IS\} significantly increased when accumulated rainfall during cone ripening was above 133 mm. Therefore, water supply would be recommended as a cultural practice to mitigate the negative impact of reduced water availability on fruit productivity. "

Wrapping the fruits while still wet from the hot water treatment provided effective, antifungal protection for the melons for 9 days at 18°C without any retention of the excess water under the wrapping which would enhance decay development.

Control fruit stored at −1.1 °C ripened and developed significant scald within 7 d at 20 °C following 3–5 months of storage. While 1-MCP@−1.1 °C fruit did not develop ripening capacity due to extremely low internal ethylene concentration (IEC) and ethylene production rate for 8 months, 1-MCP@1.1 °C fruit produced significant amounts of \{IEC\} during storage and developed ripening capacity with relatively low levels of scald within 7 d at 20 °C following 6–8 months of storage. 1-MCP@2.2 °C fruit lost quality quickly during storage. Compared to the control, the expression of ethylene synthesis (PcACS1, PcACO1) and signal (PcETR1, PcETR2) genes was stable at extremely low levels in 1-MCP@−1.1 °C fruit. In contrast, they increased expression after 4 or 5 months of storage in 1-MCP@1.1 °C fruit. Other genes (PcCTR1, PcACS2, PcACS4 and PcACS5) remained at very low expression regardless of fruit capacity to ripen. A storage temperature of 1.1 °C can facilitate initiation of ripening capacity in 1-MCP treated ‘d’Anjou’ pears with relatively low scald incidence following 6–8 months storage through recovering the expression of certain ethylene synthesis and signal genes.

Transcription profiles of genes involved in ethylene biosynthesis (PaACO, PaACS1 and PaACS2) and action (PaETR, PaERS1 and PaCTR1) were studied in seeded and seedless avocado fruit during ripening at ambient and low temperatures and in response to exogenous ethylene and 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP). Seedless mature fruit had a shorter preclimacteric lag, faster softening, and higher respiration during ambient temperature ripening than seeded ones. Advanced ripening in seedless fruit was accompanied by higher levels of PaACO and PaACS1 expression at harvest, and these levels increased dramatically towards the climacteric peak. The expression of PaETR, PaERS1 and PaCTR1 increased in parallel with the onset of the ethylene burst in seedless fruit, whereas PaETR increase predominantly in seeded ones. Seedless fruit exhibited an earlier response to exogenous ethylene at the day of harvest, than seeded fruit. On day 1 after harvest, ethylene application elicited lower levels of ethylene in seeded than in seedless fruit, concomitantly with massive PaCTR1 augmentation. This suggests that the negative regulator PaCTR may moderate the effect of ethylene on seeded fruit. Cold storage induced biosynthesis and regulatory genes in both seedless and seeded fruit relative to their levels at ambient temperature. However, in the first and second weeks in cold storage, PaACO, PaACS1 and PaACS2 expression levels were much higher in seedless than in seeded fruit, which could explain the higher levels of ethylene and accelerated softening of the seedless fruit in cold storage. Seeded and seedless fruit responded similarly to ethylene or 1-MCP application prior to cold storage. Ethylene slightly induced ethylene production, but significantly increased \{CO2\} output. 1-MCP equally and effectively delayed softening, reduced ethylene and \{CO2\} production and expression of genes involved in ethylene biosynthesis and ethylene action in seeded and seedless fruit. Both at ambient temperature and in cold storage respiration was higher in seedless than seeded fruit. Our findings demonstrate that the seed is involved in regulation of ethylene responsiveness during ripening, and acts to delay climacteric in mature seeded fruit. "

Through six rounds of in vivo screening, three isolates showing the highest biocontrol efficacy against Monilinia laxa on peaches were selected. By using molecular and morphological tools, the strain \{AP6\} was identified as Pseudozyma fusiformata, the strain \{AP47\} as Metschnikowia sp., and the strain \{PL5\} as Aureobasidium pullulans. This research represents the first evidence about the potential use of P. fusiformata to control postharvest diseases of fruit. By co-culturing in vitro M. laxa in the presence of the three antagonists, neither the inactivated cells nor the culture filtrate of the three isolates had any significant effect on spore germination or germ tube elongation, allowing exclusion of the production of secreted toxic metabolites. The antagonistic activity of A. pullulans \{PL5\} and P. fusiformata \{AP6\} was dependent on the cell concentration. Metschnikowia sp. \{AP47\} significantly inhibited spore germination at the three concentrations tested (106 cells/mL, 107 cells/mL, and 108 cells/mL). The efficacy of the three strains was tested on peaches stored at three different temperatures, and their effectiveness was higher at 1 °C than at 8 °C or 20 °C. In trials carried out in semi-commercial conditions with peaches inoculated by spraying 105 spores/mL of M. laxa and stored for 21 d at 1 °C and 96% RH, a cell concentration effect on the control of brown rot incidence was observed. \{AP6\} and \{PL5\} showed no significant differences in efficacy when applied at 1 × 108 cells/mL or at 1 × 107 cells/mL, indicating that they could be used at a lower concentration in potential biofungicide formulations. Finally, in an experiment in semi-commercial conditions on fruit not inoculated with the pathogen with 21 d storage at 1 °C and 96% RH, the evaluation of postharvest quality parameters, including firmness, total soluble solids, ascorbic acid content, and titratable acidity, showed that none of the three screened antagonists impaired peach quality, when applied before storage. The present study identified three antagonistic microorganisms with potential exploitation as active ingredients for the development of products for postharvest control of brown rot on peaches. "

Acidity, except for ‘Galaxy’ apples, and sugars were influenced by the climatic conditions of the growing sites. There was no relationship between the lenticels dyeing and the incidence of lenticel breakdown. Contrary to the expectations, higher incidence of the disorder was noticed in ‘Gala’ apples grown in São Joaquim (SC) at the end of the both types of storage. The lenticel breakdown was featured by symptoms such as concentric depression around the lenticels, cell obliteration of the epidermis and subepidermal layers, with wide spaces formed by cell lysis. The origin of lenticels has no influence on the disorder development. It was not possible to establish a relationship among physicochemical, physiological and anatomical features from distinct growing sites and the predisposition to lenticel breakdown disorder. "

With Time-resolved Reflectance Spectroscopy (TRS), the maturity of nectarines at harvest can be assessed by measuring the absorption coefficient at 670 nm (μa), near the chlorophyll peak, in the fruit flesh. A kinetic model has been developed linking the absorption coefficient, expressed as the biological shift factor (Δt*), to firmness decrease during ripening. As the decrease in μa in nectarines is linked with softening, shelf life for individual fruit can be predicted. In order to verify the applicability of this methodology in the supply chain, about 1000 nectarines were measured at harvest by TRS, graded into six classes of usability based on the prediction of their individual softening (‘will never ripe’, ‘dangerously hard’, ‘transportable’, ‘ready to eat-firm’, ‘ready to eat-ripe’, ‘overripe’) and transported from Italy to the Netherlands by a regular temperature-controlled truck. On arrival, fruit was kept at 20 °C and tested for sensory softness (finger feeling) after 5 and 13 days of shelf life. The classes ‘will never ripe’, ‘dangerously hard’ and ‘overripe’ were correctly predicted, as the first two did not soften and the last one was too soft and subject to rot. The intermediate classes showed sufficient firmness to be transported and sufficient ripening potential to satisfy consumers. "

This situation creates a problem in that the selection of batches to sell has a large influence on the postharvest losses that are incurred over the entire crop. Optimally, batches with low storability should be sold as quickly as possible to reduce losses. This paper proposes a system in which data collected under accelerated conditions (higher temperatures) are used to fit a Weibull distribution model and subsequently predict storability performance at optimal storage conditions. Use of the proposed system to inform First (to) Expire, First-Out (FEFO) batch sales rank is tested with a hypothetical scenario in comparison to simple First-In, First-Out (FIFO) and Last-In First-Out (LIFO) inventory scheduling protocols. Recommendations for improvements in the data collection from the accelerated fruit libraries to enable possible application to a suitable fresh product industry are suggested. "

Berry colour at 10 and 20 °C tended to become greener with dehydration but at 30 °C, at the final sampling, the colour darkened. Acidity decreased in all samples, while sugars increased. Total phenol content increased at 10 °C until 30% weight loss was reached and then declined, while at 20 and 30 °C the concentration decreased immediately. The contents of lutein and β-carotene (respectively 68 and 58 mg/kg d.w.), representing the 80% of total carotenoids, did not change significantly until the 30% of weight loss, when at 30 °C the value increased above all for lutein while at 10 and 20 °C, the contents decreased significantly. Daidzein, at 10 °C, rose significantly from about 150 μg/kg d.w. to 1434 μg/kg d.w. at 20% weight loss and then declined; at the same weight loss percentage, the genistein concentration began to increase. At 20 °C both isoflavones rose until the end of the experiment, reaching values similar to the sample at 10 °C. A temperature of 30 °C was deleterious to grape isoflavones. A discussion on the changes in isoflavones related to temperature and time is reported. "

In general, molds can grow over a wide range of temperatures. However, the rates of mold growth and mycotoxin production depend on temperature and available water (water activities). Insects and mites can not only cause physical damage and nutrient losses in grains but also serve as mold carriers or create conditions for mold invasion. Broken kernels caused by harvesting or handling are easily subject to mold infestation. Mycotoxin contamination is a worldwide food safety problem. It can cause significant economic losses associated with the adverse effects of mycotoxins on human and animal health, food security, and international trade. Among over 300 mycotoxins that have been determined to present significant health and economic impacts are the aflatoxins, deoxynivalenol (DON), ergot alkaloids, fumonisins, ochratoxin A (OTA), patulin, and zearalenone (ZEA). Mycotoxins can occur in a wide variety of agricultural products, such as cereal grains, peanuts, tree nuts, apples, other fruits, cocoa beans, coffee beans, oilseeds, wine, beer, and spices. They can also be found in meat, milk, and eggs. The occurrence of molds and mycotoxins can be controlled by applying a number of preventive measures both before and after harvesting crops, including insect control, good harvesting, drying, and storage practices. If mycotoxin contamination has occurred, the levels of toxins can be reduced by physical, chemical, or biological decontamination. Milling, food processing, and regulatory control of toxins to safety levels can also have a positive impact on the safety of food. "

A literature survey of temperature effects on tomato yield was performed and the main temperature effects were implemented in the model. Subsequently, the yield model was validated for four temperature regimes. Results demonstrated that the tomato yield was simulated accurately for both near-optimal and non-optimal temperature conditions in the Netherlands and southern Spain, respectively, with varying light and CO2-concentrations. In addition, the adverse effects of extremely low as well as high mean temperatures on yield and timing of first fruit harvest were simulated with fair accuracy. The simulated yield response to extreme diurnal temperature oscillations were in agreement with literature values. Given these results, the model is considered to be sufficiently accurate to be used for developing a model-based greenhouse design method. Therefore, the presented model will be integrated in a model-based design method with the aim to design the best greenhouse for local climate and economic conditions. "

Translucency was more severe and had a higher incidence when maximum and minimum temperatures 3 months before harvest were both low, 23 °C and 15 °C; or to a lesser extent high, 29 °C and 20 °C, respectively. Fruit with larger crowns had a lower incidence and severity of translucency. Temperature, 2–4 months before harvest explained 94% to 96% of the variation in crown weight but not fruit weight.

No clear relationship of \{OD200\} and scald development was observed. Correlation of scald index and \{OD200\} at the end of storage was negative for the second harvest date. There was no significant correlation between the scald index and CT259. Scald index was positively correlated with \{CT269\} after 80 days for the second and third harvest and at the end of storage for the second harvest. \{CT281\} was spectrophotometrically detectable only at the end of the storage, for the third harvest date, in control, \{HWD\} 42 °C, and \{HWD\} 44 °C. \{HWD\} 42 °C had significantly higher \{CT281\} compared to \{HWD\} 44 °C and control. \{HPLC\} analysis of control samples revealed presence of \{CT281\} in all three harvest dates, and presence of at least two components, as was the case of \{CT259\} and CT269. The ratio of these two components was different for all three \{CT\} species. Fruit maturity was an important factor determining the response of fruit to heat and occurrence of superficial scald.

Being a subtropical exotic fruit, however, little is known about its postharvest features or the best methods of handling, transporting, and storage. Cherimoyas are highly perishable climacteric fruits with high respiration rate and ethylene production. Ripening is characterized by increased soluble solids, acidity, softening, and the acquisition of aroma and flavor. The mechanism by which this process is induced and controlled is not clear. The major problem in postharvest handling of this fruit is to retard the quick ripening process. Temperature is an effective tool, but its usefulness is limited by the sensitivity of cherimoyas to chill injury below 7–10°C, depending on the variety. The role of ethylene is uncertain and the use of chemical ethylene absorbers requires further study. Modified atmosphere has been found to be a promising alternative, but a great amount of research is still required to answer basic questions about the physiology of this fruit. "

The objective of this study was to identify weather parameters during fruit development that influence soft scald development in ‘Honeycrisp’ apples. Soft scald susceptibility of ‘Honeycrisp’ has been linked to weather conditions during specific periods of the growing season, referenced by given phenological stages. Using weather data and fruit quality analysis data from three sites in Ontario, two sites in Quebec and one site in Nova Scotia for three seasons (2009–2011) and four additional sites in Ontario from 2002–2006, a model for soft scald incidence (SSI) was built to predict the susceptibility of ‘Honeycrisp’ apples prior to storage. This model used primarily two weather variables during three sub-periods of fruit development to accumulate a \{SSI\} index (%) during the growing season, from full bloom to harvest time. Relatively wet conditions during phenological stages from full bloom until 10 mm diameter (precipitation &gt; 0.5 mm) and from 10 mm until 50% of final caliber (precipitation &gt; 6.0 mm), cool conditions (temperature &lt; 15 °C) from full bloom until 10 mm diameter, and warm conditions (temperature &gt; 20 °C) from 50 to 80% of final size are conditions that resulted in increased soft scald susceptibility for ‘Honeycrisp’ apples.

Application of 1-MCP significantly alleviated the development of chilling injury disorders such as browning and pitting in okra pods in a concentration-dependent pattern, which was associated with lower membrane permeability and lipid peroxidation. In addition, 1-MCP treatment inhibited the decreases in color parameters (hue angle, lightness and chroma) and chlorophyll degradation, indicating that the bright green color in 1-MCP-treated fruit was well maintained. Furthermore, 1-MCP reduced the chilling-induced decline in variable:maximal chlorophyll fluorescence (Fv/Fm), an indicator of stress injury in plant tissues. Moreover, significantly lower respiration rate in 1-MCP-treated okra was also observed than in control fruit. Overall, 1-MCP treatment showed great potential to reduce the development of chilling injury disorders and maintain fruit quality, which may be a promising technique to extend the storage life of okra pods at low temperature.

In the present study, we investigated the role of NADP-ME gene expression and activity in lowering malic acid contents and in the provision of \{NADPH\} required for the regeneration of the reduced form of glutathione (GSH). We also measured glutathione reductase (GR: \{EC\} 1.6.4.2) activity in strawberries treated with different high \{CO2\} concentrations (0, 20 and 40% for 3 days) during storage at 0 °C. A decrease in malic acid content in fruit exposed to 20% \{CO2\} was primarily mediated by the stimulation of NADP-ME activity, rather than associated with changes in the expression of cytosolic NADP-ME genes. Moreover, malic acid decarboxylation was associated with a marked increase in \{GR\} activity, which may account for the increased levels of glutathione in fruit following exposure to 20% CO2. This chain of events was not observed in untreated fruit stored in air or in fruit treated with 40% CO2, suggesting that the unique cellular redox status of 20% CO2-treated fruit plays an important role in detoxification and protection from damage during storage. Based on these findings, we propose that NADP-ME activation in fruit exposed to 20% \{CO2\} provides \{NADPH\} for glutathione regeneration by GR, thereby conferring protection against the cellular damage caused by low temperatures or excessive high \{CO2\} levels.

The pretreated tomatoes were incubated in darkness at room temperature, and a* and b* values, firmness and lycopene contents were measured after 7, 14, and 21 days of storage. The tomatoes pretreated with blue light had delayed softening; however, these tomatoes ripened fully, recovering red color development and accumulation of lycopene during 21 days of storage in darkness. These findings indicate that simple single blue wavelength illumination can be an effective application to extend the shelf-life of tomatoes by delaying fruit softening and ripening. Further studies should be conducted to characterize the roles and regulatory mechanisms of the components involved in the delay of tomato ripening by blue light. "

If the most desirable food quality is that of the freshly harvested fruit or vegetable, then the ultimate in frozen food would be perfect preservation of the living state. Water is the major component of plants and most plant parts (except seeds and woody stems) and the major component undergoing a phase change during freezing. Water, the major component of plants, undergoes a phase change during freezing. When solutions freeze, loss of water to the solid phase leaves the remaining solution more concentrated. Plants differ widely in their responses to low temperatures. Seeds are a means of reproducing and increasing the number of plants. In plants, beyond the young seedling stage, a number of responses to chilling have been observed. Most plants that survive freezing temperatures during winter experience a frost-free season during which their major growth takes place. Dehardening (loss of the ability to survive low temperatures) is the response of hardened plants to temperature increases. Fruits and vegetables include a wide range of plant parts harvested and eaten at various stages of maturity. Fresh fruits and vegetables are living organs that continue their metabolic processes after they have been harvested. The chapter discusses that fruits and vegetables are obtained from a variety of plants whose edible parts are harvested at times ranging from the extreme immaturity of germinating seedling to the senescence of mature fruit.

abstract = "Fruit ripening is a complex process that involves a variety of biochemical changes and is also associated with increased susceptibility to pathogens. The present study determined the effects of fruit maturity and storage conditions on the infection capacity of a host (P. expansum) and non-host (P. digitatum) pathogen on apple. A range of inoculum concentrations and two different storage temperatures were utilized. Exposure to P. expansum at 20 °C resulted in significant differences in rot dynamics in apples collected at the earliest harvest date compared to all later harvest dates and inoculum concentrations assayed. Greater differences in infection capacity between harvests were obtained when fruit was stored at low temperature (0 °C). In contrast, P. digitatum was able to infect apples only under specific conditions and disease symptoms were limited to the initial wound inoculation site. When apples were resistant to P. digitatum, a visible browning reaction around the infection site was observed. Histochemical analyses of tissues surrounding the wound site were conducted. A positive reaction for lignin was observed in immature apples as early as 1 day after inoculation with either pathogen. Experiments conducted with the non-host pathogen indicated that lignification was an essential component of resistance in apples harvested prior to maturity or at commercial maturity. Apples harvested at an over‐mature stage and inoculated with P. digitatum did not show evidence of staining for lignin until 7 days post-inoculation. Control samples only showed positive reaction in immature harvest. Results demonstrated that the maturity stage of fruit is an important factor in apple resistance to both P. expansum and P. digitatum and that lignin accumulation seems to play an important role when resistance is observed. Moreover, this is the first report demonstrating that P. digitatum, a non-host pathogen, has a limited capacity to infect apples. "

abstract = "Postharvest heat treatments lead to an alteration of gene expression and fruit ripening can sometimes be either delayed or disrupted. The extent of the alternation of fruit ripening is a function of the exposure temperature and duration and how quickly the commodity is cooled following the heat treatment. The most commonly measured components of fruit ripening affected by heat treatments include fruit softening, membrane and flavor changes, respiration rate, ethylene production, and volatile production. Cell wall degrading enzymes and ethylene production are frequently the most disrupted and are sometimes not produced or their appearance is delayed following heating. Other processes associated with ripening are not altered to the same extent or soon recover. Fruit sensitivity to heat treatments is modified by preharvest weather conditions, cultivar, rate of heating, and subsequent storage conditions. The amount of sensitivity or tolerance to heat stress of a commodity is related to the level of heat protective proteins at harvest and the postharvest production of heat shock proteins. Two types of heat responses are seen. The first is a normal cellular response (&lt;42°C) that can lead to reduced chilling sensitivity, delayed or slowed ripening and a modification of quality. The second occurs near the threshold for damage &gt;45°C and is modified by the pre-stress environmental conditions, the cellular response to stress and cellular recovery. Loss of membrane integrity appears to be an effect and not a cause of injury. The site of the injury lesion is still unknown and could be associated with transcription, translation and cellular recovery capacity after an injury threshold has been exceeded. "

This requires the removal of a large amount of heat in a relatively short time, necessitating a high refrigeration capacity and very high investment cost. This paper presents experimental results from a novel precooler, using naturally-cooled water instead of mechanical refrigeration. The water is cooled in a roof-pond arrangement, in which water in shallow pond is exposed to the night sky, to cool by radiation and evaporation, and covered with insulated panels during the day, to prevent heat gain into the water. A small pump is used to spray the water inside a packed cooling tower, to cool air being forced through the tower as part of a forced-air precooler. The air is then used to remove field heat from products. Afterwards, the products may be left in storage in the roof-pond room, if desired. Compared to conventional systems, this system is a low-energy one, requiring energy only to operate the pump and fan, but none for cooling. The system can also be used for first-stage cooling, in conjunction with conventional refrigeration system, to reduce load. Experiments were performed using a 10-m2 roof pond, a 25-m3 cold room, and a cooling tower with a capacity of 1,000 kg of product. Products tested included various fruits and vegetables. Seven-eighth cooling times (the time required for product to decrease in temperature equal to seven-eighth the difference between initial product temperature and the cooling air temperature) were found to be between two and three hours.

Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) is a further enzyme prominent in the phenolic metabolism that is involved in acclimation against chilling stress. It was hypothesized that treatment with methyl jasmonate (MJ) and salicylic acid (SA) may enhance chilling tolerance in lemon fruit by increasing the synthesis of total phenolics and \{PAL\} by activating the key enzyme regulating the shikimic acid pathway whilst inhibiting the activity of \{POD\} and PPO. Lemon fruit were treated with 10 μM MJ, 2 mM \{SA\} or 10 μM \{MJ\} plus 2 mM SA, waxed, stored at −0.5, 2 or 4.5 °C for up to 28 days plus 7 days at 23 °C. Membrane integrity was studied by investigating membrane permeability and the degree of membrane lipid peroxidation in lemon flavedo following cold storage. The 10 μM \{MJ\} plus 2 mM \{SA\} treatment was most effective in enhancing chilling tolerance of lemon fruit, significantly reducing chilling-induced membrane permeability and membrane lipid peroxidation of lemon flavedo tissue. This treatment also increased total phenolics and \{PAL\} activity in such tissue while inhibiting \{POD\} activity, the latter possibly contributing to the delay of \{CI\} manifestation. \{PPO\} activity was found to be a poor biochemical marker of CI. Treatment with 10 μM \{MJ\} plus 2 mM \{SA\} resulted in an alteration of the phenolic metabolism, enhancing chilling tolerance, possibly through increased production of total phenolics and the activation of \{PAL\} and inhibition of POD.

However, 1-MCP at −0.5 °C prevents pear ripening, and \{DCA\} can favor the appearance of soft scald, especially after long storage. The aim of this research was to study how postharvest treatments (storage atmosphere, temperature and time) can modulate the ripening ability in storage of 1-MCP treated ‘Abbé Fétel’ pears. To this aim, control and 1-MCP treated (SmartFresh™, 300 nL L−1) pears stored in air (NA), controlled atmosphere (CA) and \{DCA\} at either −0.5 °C or 1 °C for 20 and 28 weeks were evaluated for ripening in storage by relating the spectral maturity indices \{IAD\} (index of absorbance difference), bound to chlorophyll, and Icarot (carotenoids index), bound to carotenoids, to ethylene production, background skin color, mechanical properties of the pulp (firmness, stiffness and energy-to-rupture) and sugar (soluble solid content) and organic acid (titratable acidity) contents. The 1-MCP treatment drastically reduced ethylene production, impaired skin yellowing and fruit softening during storage of fruit kept at −0.5 °C, regardless of storage atmosphere and length of storage. The 1-MCP treatment coupled to 1 °C storage in \{NA\} succeeded in maintaining firmness and green color in storage but without blocking them, as indicated by the significant decrease in texture parameters and background skin hue achieved already in storage. 1-MCP treated samples which did not ripen in storage (DCA@−0.5 °C, DCA@1 °C, CA@−0.5 °C of both storage times and CA@1 °C at 20 weeks) were distinguished from the 1-MCP treated pears which began to ripen at different times in storage, i.e. NA@−0.5 °C, showing the least marked changes, and NA@1 °C after 28 weeks, having the highest changes in ripeness in storage. In control fruit, \{IAD\} index better correlated to \{TA\} and ethylene production, while Icarot index better correlated to pulp mechanical properties and allowed the differentiation of control samples according to the ripeness degree reached already in storage, with NA@1 °C fruit after 28 weeks being the ripest and DCA@−0.5 °C pears after 20 weeks, the least ripe.

Treated fruit were more than 75 N firmer than control fruit after a 6 day storage period. Fruit color changes were also delayed by 1-MCP treatment. However, additional color sorting may be necessary to reduce variability in response of fruit to 1-MCP in commercial situations. 1-MCP-treated fruit had lower total glycosidase (α- and β-d-galactosidase, α-l-arabinofuranosidase, β-d-xylosidase, and β-d-glucosidase) activities. When 1-MCP was applied to fruit prior to cold storage (CS) at 1 °C, the synergistic interaction of cold and 1-MCP resulted in an extended postharvest life after transfer to room temperature, with concomitant delayed ethylene and respiratory level increases, retarded color development and retention of firmness. In contrast, application of 0.4–1.6 μl l−1 1-MCP after 30 or 60 days of cold storage did not affect most ripening indices. These findings point to the experimental and commercial utility of 1-MCP in “Bartlett” pear postharvest management. "

The percent contribution of virgin females by weight was significantly higher in prawns fed a diet containing 15% fish meal than in prawns fed a diet containing 7.5% fish meal. The malefemale ratio ranged from 2.5 to 5.3 among treatments and averaged 3.0 overall.

Evaluations were made after storage for one week at 1 °C plus one day at 20 °C. Delaying the start of precooling resulted in about 50% greater water loss than in control fruit, which was evident as increases in superficial shrivelling. Tissue firmness values were also 14–22% lower in fruit from the delayed treatment. Fruits were darker (lower L∗ value), less bright (lower chroma) and apparently less red (lower a∗ value) with the cooling delay, although hue angle was also lower, which may reflect the occurrence of browning. No significant differences in pH were observed in these experiments, but titratable acidity was slightly lower with the delay to cooling. Delaying precooling also caused increased losses of ascorbic acid, soluble solids, fructose, glucose and sucrose compared to controls. In spite of differences related to harvest time and the variability among cultivars, the general responses were quite similar and illustrate the importance of rapid precooling and subsequent storage at low temperature for maintenance of acceptable appearance, texture and nutritive value of strawberries.

The grape clusters were stored at 20 °C or at 10 °C with low (70%) or high (&gt;95%) RH, thus creating 4 \{WVPD\} levels. At each \{WVPD\} the clusters were held in open punnets, punnets sealed with low density polyethylene film or microperforated polyethylene, and examed every 2 or 3 d for weight loss, berry firmness, rachis dry weight and subjective rachis index. In addition, the rachis were photographed and image analysis employed to identify the level of browning. The results show that image analysis gave very similar patterns to subjective evaluation of rachis browning with correlation coefficients up to 0.90. However, image analysis detected an increase in browning before subjective evaluation. There was poor overall correlation between cluster weight loss and rachis dry weight to browning for ‘Superior’ grapes but a good correlation for ‘Thompson’. Rachis of ‘Superior’ suffered extensive browning at 20 °C even at high \{RH\} while rachis of ‘Thompson’ remained relatively green under similar conditions. ‘Thompson’ grape rachis remained green during the entire examination period (11 d) when held at high \{RH\} in either 10 °C or 20 °C. At high WVPD, microperforated packaging offered better control of browning in ‘Superior’ grapes than closed packaging, while clusters of ‘Thompson’ retained green rachis after 4 d in open punnets, and after 7 d in covered punnets. In summary, detailed analysis of rachis browning shows that water loss is an important but not the only factor in browning. Quantitative and objective measurement of rachis browning is likely to facilitate better communication of experimental data and higher resolution of processes which lead to browning. "

The concentration of anthocyanins increased at both temperatures of storage in both ripe and partially ripe cherries, but the extent of increase varied among cultivars. Cherries stored at 15 ± 5 °C showed higher reduction of L∗, chroma and hue angle than fruits stored at 1.5 ± 0.5 °C. L∗, a∗, b∗, chroma and hue angle correlated negatively (P &lt; 0.001) with the total anthocyanins levels, but not with the total phenols. These results show that chromatic functions of chroma and hue correlate closely with the evolution of colour and anthocyanins levels during storage of sweet cherries and indicate that colour measurements can be used to monitor pigment evolution and anthocyanin contents of cherries (and vice versa).

abstract = "Publisher Summary Avocado (Persea americana Mil.) is a subtropical tree that is relatively frost-sensitive and grows to a height of 5–30 m. The fleshy fruit are borne yearly from the current season's wood and the green fruit ripen only after being harvested. Avocado oil is obtained from the flesh fruit and is a relatively new arrival in culinary circles. The predominant uses of avocado oil are in the cosmetic industry because of its stability and high level of vitamin E (α-tocopherol). The bulk of avocado oil is extracted by relatively harsh methods like high temperature and solvent extraction, typically followed by standard refining steps. The ultimate market of the oil generally dictates the fruit quality required. For the production of good-quality cold-pressed oil, the fruit must be relatively sound with mainly cosmetic-quality issues or too small for sale. Cold-pressed avocado oil is a new product with significant production, commercialization, and marketing only occurring in the 21st century. Avocado oil is a high-value oil with excellent qualities for both culinary and cosmetic uses. "

Pears were treated with ethylene (air+10 Pa C2H4) or air (untreated) at 20°C for 24 h to determine their responsiveness to C2H4, including the effect on 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) synthase (ACC-S) and \{ACC\} oxidase (ACC-O) activity during subsequent ripening at 20°C. Exposing freshly harvested and non-chilled ‘Bartlett’ pears to 24 h exogenous \{C2H4\} treatment concurrently stimulated the activity of ACC-S and ACC-O, and resulted in higher \{C2H4\} production, which advanced the rate of ripening and reduced the firmness variability regardless of maturity, growing region or season. Differences in the rate of softening between ethylene-treated and untreated pears were greatest for fruit from earlier harvest dates. The ripening capacity of ‘Bartlett’ pears developed as the fruit matured on the tree, resulting in higher ACC-S activity, ACC-O activity and \{C2H4\} production, but the ripening capacity was not fully induced unless the fruit were cold stored or treated with exogenous C2H4. Ethylene production was higher in fruit from growing locations that experience cooler preharvest temperatures and fruit from later harvests within each location. Pears harvested from warmer growing regions as well as early harvests from later growing locations which experience cooler preharvest night temperatures can benefit from treatment with \{C2H4\} after harvest to promote uniform ripening.

Quaternary ammonium (QA) has been known for over 50 years as an efficient disinfectant against microorganisms, with wide applications in the food industry. The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of didecyldimethylammonium chloride (Sporekill, designated here as QAsk), against development of Botrytis cinerea after direct exposure or by ultrasonic fogging. Following direct exposure to a concentration of \{QAsk\} below 5 mg L−1, a population of 104 conidia of B. cinerea was inactivated after 2 min; ultrasonic fogging with \{QAsk\} at 500 mg L−1 took 30 min to achieve consistent inactivation. Fumigation at 20 °C was considerably more effective than fumigation at 5 °C, and similar results were obtained for three other postharvest pathogens, Penicillium expansum, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides and Alternaria alternata. These results show that conidia of B. cinerea are highly sensitive to direct exposure to QAsk, but that effective sanitation of a storage facility by ultrasonic fumigation requires a \{QAsk\} concentration two orders of magnitude greater.

The effect of 1-MCP was significantly reduced when fruit were stored after 1-MCP treatment for 45 d at intermediate temperatures (10 or 5 compared with 0 °C). Ripening of fruit treated with 1-MCP at 0.3 μL/L for 12 versus 24 h at 20 °C was not significantly different, suggesting the 1-MCP response was saturated by a 12 h exposure at 20 °C. However, at 0 °C, treatment with 0.3 μL/L 1-MCP for 24 h was more effective in inhibiting ripening than a 12 h exposure, and 1-MCP treatment for 24 h at 0 °C was less effective than 24 h at 20 °C, suggesting the response takes longer to saturate at lower temperatures. The presence of as little as 0.3 μL/L ethylene during 1-MCP application significantly reduced the efficacy of 1-MCP in ripening inhibition. Ethylene concentration and fruit temperature during 1-MCP application, along with fruit temperature during storage after 1-MCP treatment appear to be important factors regulating 1-MCP efficacy in ‘Bartlett pears.

The investigated parameters differed significantly (p &lt; 0.05) at different temperatures and duration. Results showed that \{TP\} increased with storage temperatures and duration with the maximum levels measured at 10 °C (364.47 mg/100 ml) for 3 months storage period. However, the concentration declined thereafter at all storage regimes, the lowest concentration was 196 mg/100 ml in fruit stored at 7.5 °C for 5 months. Similarly, Acy concentration increased with storage temperatures in the first month, and gradually declined thereafter. Furthermore, ascorbic acid concentration gradually declined with storage period, with the lowest concentration (12.69 mg/100 ml) measured at 7.5 °C after 5 month storage. For antioxidant activity, storage of fruit at 5 °C, 7.5 °C, and 10 °C significantly (p &lt; 0.05) reduced the radical scavenging activity of juice by more than 56% when stored beyond 2 months. This study highlights the need to consider the effects of different temperatures and duration on health promoting compounds in pomegranate fruit, especially where fruit are stored for long term and primarily used for health-promoting purposes.

The concept was to develop a cherry product cut such that the pit and associated tissue from stem bowl to the nose of the fruit were removed in a single cutting operation, leaving a cherry with a ‘hole’ which could be filled with various foodstuffs (much like a pitted olive). Secondary objectives were to determine if the design of the cutting tube, storage at low temperature before cutting or preharvest treatment with gibberellic acid (GA: used to improve firmness in commercial production) could influence the quality of packaged fresh-cut sweet cherries. Most cultivars of sweet cherries tested appeared to be suitable for cutting, and quality was not impacted significantly if \{GA\} was used on the fruit prior to harvest. Low temperature of the fruit at the time of cutting appeared to lead to greater deterioration than warm temperatures and so perhaps a warm-up time is required if the fruit are held in cold storage before cutting. Finally, the design of the cutting tube was of great importance with a scalloped-edge resulting in a lower cutting force, and hence less injury and better quality, than a straight-edge design. "

Epiphytic antagonist microorganisms were apparently present on the pineapple fruit, as evidenced by the reduction of black rot severity when fruit were treated with pineapple fruit wash water. The most frequently isolated yeasts were able to inhibit Ceratocystis paradoxa growth in vitro and the most inhibitory isolated was Pichia guilliermondii. A mixture of five selected yeast isolates halved black rot severity compared to the control. Pichia and the yeast mixture reduced spore germination, germ tube length, and dry weight of C. paradoxa. The use of Pichia or the yeast mixture was comparable with current industry practice of holding fruit at a low temperature (8–10 °C) and fungicide. Combining the isolated Pichia or the yeast mixture with a half rate of fungicide resulted in complete control of black rot comparable to control achieved with a commercial rate of recommended fungicide. The mode of action by Pichia appeared to be competition for space and nutrients, while for the yeast mixture, mode of action appeared to be competition for space. Another possibility would be a growth inhibitor though no evidence was found to support this possibility. "

An adequate availability of photosynthates translocated from the canopy also affects root respiration (RR) and therefore RS. In this work, carried out in an apple orchard for three years, we assessed the role of temperature to \{RS\} and its autotrophic (RR) and heterotrophic (RH) components. We also determined the variation over the season of \{RS\} at a reference temperature and related it to concurrent data of gross primary productivity at ecosystem level (GPP), light (PPFD), air temperature (Tair), orchard net primary productivity (NPP) and root growth rate. Several of these factors were then incorporated into a model to estimate RS. Data showed that temperature alone explained less than 50 % of \{RS\} variability at yearly scale. GPP, NPP, \{PPFD\} and Tair were correlated to \{RS\} at a reference temperature. The contribution of root respiration to \{RS\} increased with increasing photosynthetic activity, total tree and root growth, \{PPFD\} and Tair. On a diurnal scale, the time lag between the pattern of \{GPP\} and the pattern of \{RR\} was between 2.5 and 3 h during the growing season, decreasing to 1.5 after fruit harvest. Including GPP, NPP, \{PPFD\} and Tair to a temperature-based model improved its predicting power of RS. The results confirm the existence of a tight coupling between plant metabolism and root-derived soil respiration in the apple orchard. "

Sugar and acids levels were measured repeatedly on the same tomato using tissue samples obtained with a biopsy needle in combination with \{HPLC\} protocols. Biopsies of pericarp and locular gel tissue from tomatoes differing in position in the truss, from mature green to ripe red, were taken from a beef- (‘Licorossa’), a cocktail- (‘Lucino’) and a cherry type (‘Petit Sweet’) cultivar. Tomatoes were stored up to three weeks at three temperatures (12, 19 and 24.5 °C) and biopsy samples were taken every few days. A model regarding the most important processes that interconvert sugars and acids (glycolysis, \{TCA\} cycle and gluconeogenesis (GNG)) is proposed. Results of the model calibration showed more breakdown of hexoses in red tomatoes and more conversion of malate into hexoses in green tomatoes. More hexose turnover was found in locular gel than in pericarp tissue. \{GNG\} was more important in the cherry type cultivar due to faster hexose and malate breakdown. In the round type cultivar malate levels were higher due to faster citrate breakdown and slower malate breakdown. Starch and sucrose levels did not significantly affect postharvest sugar and acid development. Molecular markers that quantify the kinetic parameters of the model might be important to develop genotypes with better taste performance. "

To better understand the physiological role of \{ABA\} during Gladiolus hybridus cultivar ‘Rose supreme’ cormels dormancy release, the key genes involved in \{ABA\} biosynthesis (GhNCED) and catabolism (GhCYP707A1 and GhCYP707A2) were isolated and characterized.

Furthermore, changes in cormels sprouting, \{ABA\} content and GhNCED, GhCYP707A1 and GhCYP707A2 expression patterns during postharvest storage at 4 °C and 22 °C were investigated. The results showed that 4 °C storage condition was more effective to break cormels dormancy than 22 °C storage. \{ABA\} content gradually decreased to a level significantly in cormels stored at 4 °C. The expression of GhNCED in Gladiolus cormels stored at 4 °C gradually decreased and the transcription level was lower than cormels stored at 22 °C.

These findings indicated that \{ABA\} content may be co-regulated by GhNCED and GhCYP707A2 gene expression during postharvest storage and dormancy release of Gladiolus cormels. "

Three treatment levels of actual evapotranspiration (ETc) were tested in each season. The irrigations treatments were: (1) control, (100%) where irrigation was applied in order to avoid any considerable soil water deficit. (2) DI85%, where deficit irrigation (85% of control irrigation regime) was applied and (3) DI70%, where 70% of the control regime was applied. In well-watered conditions seasonal water use by squash was 479 over 86 days in summer and 306 mm over 91 days in fall season, respectively. Interaction between season and deficit irrigation treatment significantly affected plant water status as evaluated by relative water content, canopy temperature, photosynthesis efficiency. Leaf area index (LAI), total soluble solid (TSS), harvest index (HI), water-use efficiency, fruit weight, and fruit length have also been affected. After two seasons (i.e., fall and summer), soil salinity (ECe), and both of Cl− and Na+ concentrations declined significantly in 0–60 cm depth and more reduction were achieved in 0–20 cm soil depth than in 20–40 and 40–60 cm depths. Squash yield the fall growing season was higher by 19.54% comparison with the yield in summer season the highest water use efficiency (WUE) was obtained at I85% IWA. In two seasons the highest squash yield was recorded under well irrigated treatment, control (100% ETc) but non-significant differences between I100% and I85% were recorded. Therefore, under limited irrigation water, it is recommended to irrigate squash plants at I85% to produce not only the same yields, approximately, but also to save more of water as compared to I100% treatment.

Periodic destructive measurements (fresh and dry weights of different plant organs, leaf area, number of leaves and trusses) were conducted in each experiment for a period of about 100 days after flowering of the first truss (planting date). Except for one experiment, trusses were pruned to seven fruits per truss. Crop growth rate showed a slightly saturating response to photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) inside the greenhouse, probably caused by \{CO2\} depletion at high irradiance. Assuming a linear relationship between crop growth rate and \{PAR\} resulted in a slope (crop efficiency) of 2.5 g dry matter MJ−1 PAR. Crop growth rate varied between almost zero in winter and 20 g m−2 day−1 in summer. Truss appearance rate was linearly related to temperature (18–23 °C), with a slope of 0.010 truss day−1 °C−1. At 20 °C this rate was 0.146 truss day−1. Average crop specific leaf area (SLA) showed a sinusoidal relation with season and was 175–250 cm2 g−1 in summer and 300–400 cm2 g−1 in early spring, late autumn and winter. At 95–101 days after planting in most experiments 54–60% of cumulative dry matter was distributed to the fruits, 28–33% to the leaves and 12–13% to the stem. However, for late autumn plantings only 35–38% of dry matter was distributed to the fruits, 44–45% to the leaves and 18–21% to the stem, owing to poor fruit set. For all but one experiment the same relationship between total dry weight (TDW; g m−2) and fruit dry weight (FDW; g m−2) was observed: \{FDW\} = 0.642(TDW-80.0). In all experiments the ratio between produced leaf and stem dry weight was 7:3 and this ratio did not change with crop development. Fruit harvest rate showed a sinusoidal relation with season, maximum harvest rate (1 kg fresh weight m−2 week−1) was reached around mid-June. Fruit dry matter content was on average 5.6% and did not clearly depend on the season. "

All data were collected over a 26-week period from seven commercial greenhouses in British Columbia, Canada. In terms of fruit development, cuticle cracking began one week after the period of maximum fruit growth rate in pepper and progressed the most rapidly over the next two weeks. In tomato, cracking started two weeks after the time of maximum fruit growth rate, increasing steadily thereafter until harvest. Feed-forward artificial neural networks were used to relate cuticle cracking to greenhouse and crop conditions. The incidence of cuticle cracking was initially related to over 20 input variables averaged over one or four weeks prior to the date of cracking assessment. All models were developed using a portion of the data and validated with the remainder. For each dataset, 30 models were analyzed at a time, from which the best models were chosen on the basis of a suitable architecture with a high \{R2\} value and a low root mean square error when tested against the validation set using a 10-fold cross-validation procedure. Sensitivity analysis was used to determine the relative importance of each input and to reduce the number of inputs. The best week-1 and week-4 models for pepper consisted of nine inputs, with \{R2\} values of 0.71 and 0.70, respectively. Day and night temperature, day-time CO2, day and night relative humidity, radiation and growing media were inputs held in common by both models. Growing media and cultivar were also important in the week-1 models while \{EC\} and week of the year (time) were important in the week-4 models. The best week-1 and week-4 models for tomato also used nine inputs, with \{R2\} values of 0.70 and 0.64, respectively. In this case, week of the year, day and night relative humidity, day and night temperature, yield and the number of leaves were common to both models. Fruit size and fruit mass were also important in the week-1 models, while daytime \{CO2\} and radiation were important in the week-4 models. The study shows that artificial neural networks can be used to predict cuticle cracking in greenhouse peppers and tomatoes up to four weeks in advance of harvest. "

A survey among consumers indicated that tomatoes are most often stored in the refrigerator well below 10 °C, a temperature considered harmful for chilling sensitive products such as tomato. Also during distribution, tomatoes may be exposed to chilling temperatures. The effects of storage at chilling temperatures on quality aspects of tomatoes were investigated. The colour and lycopene content of red ripe tomatoes of two cultivars (cocktail and round type) was evaluated during 20 days of storage at 4, 8, 12 and 16 °C. Colour was repeatedly measured over time by tristimulus colour measurements, \{RGB\} image analysis and colour intensity was scored by eye using a consumer panel. Lycopene content was repeatedly assessed by following the \{NAI\} index over time. This index, obtained from remittance \{VIS\} spectroscopy, was found to relate closely to the lycopene level as measured by \{HPLC\} measurements of pericarp tissue. Temperatures below 12 °C resulted in lycopene loss in ripe-red tomatoes and substantial colour loss well assessed by visual evaluation. Colour measurement using tristimulus colour measurements and \{RGB\} image analysis did not correlate well with lycopene content. Prior hot water treatment did not prevent lycopene loss. Results show that storage of red ripe tomatoes at chilling temperatures reduces the nutritional and presumed health promoting value and affects fruit visual quality. "

Yet within the Kerikeri district, consistent differences in juice quality can be found between similarly managed orchards subject to the same synoptic weather patterns and inputs of photosynthetic radiation. This study examines possible causes for such differences, using comparative plant and simple climatological measurements taken over two seasons at three orchards located within a 2.5 km radius. Microclimatic differences were largely confined to windspeed and root zone soil temperatures, with the latter having a profound influence on the timing of budburst. In both seasons, delays in budbreak of around 1 month were observed at the orchard with the highest juice quality and this was attributable to a 2°C reduction in spring root zone temperatures. These lags in budhurst resulted in comparable delays in flowering, with the consequence that the season for fruit growth at the tardy site was substantially reduced. Despite these shortened seasons, subsequent juice quality (ratio of total soluble solids to titratable acids) at harvest was significantly higher at this orchard in both years. A number of possible mechanisms for this unexpected result are discussed, and lead to the following conclusion: because of the delay in budbreak, both flowering and the early stages of fruit development took place during periods of higher air temperatures, thereby encouraging higher initial rates of sugar accumulation and improvements in final fruit quality. The importance of early-season flower or fruit temperatures on final fruit quality also emerges from published statistical studies relating fruit quality to climate variables, but the biochemical basis for this influence has never been explored. Future work should concentrate on elucidating the physiological processes occurring during this critical early period of fruit development. "

Changes in blueberry quality and physiological parameters differ under room or low temperature storage conditions. The storage life of blueberries can be extended at low temperature, but pitting can develop associated with refrigeration, especially during subsequent shelf-life. The objective of this research was to understand the antioxidative metabolism accompanying pitting development of stored blueberry fruit, involving reactive oxygen species and antioxidant systems. Physiological and metabolic disorders, including low firmness, increased cell membrane electrolyte leakage and malondialdehyde (MDA) content, and changes in enzyme activity, were observed in pitting blueberries. Blueberries were stored at 20 °C and 0 °C for 10 days and 60 days, respectively. Hydrogen peroxide and superoxide radical production rate increased more rapidly during shelf-life after cold storage than at room temperature. On the other hand, blueberries during shelf-life after cold storage, when pitting occurred, had lower activity of antioxidant-related enzymes, including superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and ascorbate peroxidase (APX), than those stored at room temperature. The severity of pitting was paralleled by higher cell membrane electrolyte leakage and \{MDA\} content, and lower SOD, CAT, and \{APX\} activities. "

Storage at 2° C delayed the onset of pericarp browning, but decay became a problem 20 days after harvest. There was a continued decline in respiration rate after harvest with no ethylene being detected, and a decline in titratable acidity associated with changes in malic acid content. Ascorbic acid declined in storage from 1 to 0.4 mg g−1 in 4 days at 22° C, irrespective of storage method or temperature. Ascorbic acid changes in ‘Chen Zi’ were more marked than in ‘Hei Ye’, declining from 1.2 to 0.2 mg g−1 at 22° C after 8 days. Both cultivars showed similar qualitative changes in total soluble solids, titratable acidity and ascorbic acid content. Low-temperature storage decreased the rate and extent of changes. Storage in a polyethylene bag delayed the onset of pericarp browning at both storage temperatures. However, pericarp browning did not significantly affect aril quality as measured by sugar, acids and phenol parameters. There was a decline in total soluble solids from 18.5 to 15.5% in 8 days at 22° C due to a decrease in the amount of sucrose.

Two main aspects of treatment are dealt with: those aimed at extending storage life, and short-term treatments concerned primarily with improved marketing. Attempt has been made to summarize observations made upon the influence of carbon dioxide on post-harvest metabolic phenomena. The commercial use of controlled-atmosphere storage for apples continues to expand, both in those countries that have used it for many years and in those where ad hoe experiments have more recently provided the necessary basis for application of established methods to native varieties. The transport of fruits such as cherries, plums, and soft fruits has been assisted and influenced by the use of dry ice as a source of carbon dioxide gas. For cherries, the control of atmospheric content of carbon dioxide and oxygen with plastic package liners has played a big part in successful storage and transport of the fruit. More accurate specification of the required concentration of carbon dioxide in relation to temperature, oxygen level, and duration of exposure is needed, if controlled-atmosphere treatment is to be applied to products for which it is not in general use at present. The chapter considers some of the best means and methods used for creating the storage environment such as: ventilated stores and scrubbed stores. The applied biologist must define with reasonable accuracy the limits of temperature and concentration of carbon dioxide and oxygen required to attain a defined extension of storage life. "

The effect of vent area, shape, number and position on airflow and heat transfer characteristics was studied. An increase in vent area decreased the total pressure drop and increased the uniformity of airflow and temperature. Total pressure drop was expressed as a function of vent area in the form of a Darcy–Forchheimer equation and the results showed that vent area affected both Darcy and Forchheimer terms. Half and seven eighths cooling times and cooling rate of fruit were expressed as a function of vent area ratio and the results showed that vent number, position and shape mainly affected the uniformity of airflow and cooling. Cooling rate increased with an increase in vent area but the sensitivity of the increase in cooling rate decreased with an increase in vent area. With an increase in vent area up to 7%, there was a reasonable increase in cooling rate; however, further increase in vent area showed a relatively low increase in cooling rate. To optimize package venting, there is a need to combine such airflow and heat transfer studies with analysis of package mechanical integrity. "

The occurrence of bruising depends on the direct mechanical damaging of the tomato and the subsequent action of cell wall-related proteins. Although much research has been directed towards possible causes of mechanical injury during tomato harvest and grading, there is a clear knowledge gap concerning the internal fruit characteristics that contribute to bruise development. A simple method to determine the bruise susceptibility of tomatoes is a first requirement to close that gap. An instrumented pendulum is presented as an appropriate instrument to conduct controlled impact experiments on tomato fruit. An evaluation method of the subsequent damage is proposed. Logistic regression models are discussed as the best statistical tools for bruise development evaluation. An experiment to determine the bruise susceptibility of three different tomato cultivars illustrates the proposed method. For that experiment, red ripe tomatoes were subjected to dynamic loading by means of a pendulum at different levels of impact energy: low (0.024 J), medium (0.073 J) and high energy (0.171 J). Impacts were applied to tomatoes of the red ripe stage. All fruit were at room temperature (20 °C). Each tomato was impacted at two locations, being at the locular tissue and at the cross-wall tissue. Different logistic regression models were proposed and evaluated to best describe the bruise susceptibility of the cultivars. The tomatoes’ susceptibility to bruise damage appeared to be dependent on the location of impact and cultivar, and was most simply expressed as a function of the applied impact energy. A logistic regression function based on accurate impact data, fruit parameters, and a sensory-based score for the resulting bruise damage, proved to be appropriate to describe the tomato bruise susceptibility.

This paper presents, a self-sustained carbonization of oil palm empty fruit bunch biomass, without internal heating element, which produced high biochar yield and higher heating value. Three different particle sizes of pressed-shredded oil palm empty fruit bunch biomass, i.e. below 29 mm, 30–99 mm and 100–150 mm, at 8–10% moisture content were used. The carbonization temperature was monitored and used as an indicator to stop the carbonization prior to harvesting. The maximum carbonization temperature recorded was 600 °C. In our previous report, harvested at 300 °C under uncontrolled exhausted air flow rate and found that the higher heating values obtained were 23.0–25.0 MJ/kg. However the biochar yield was only 14–16 %. In order to increase the yield of biochar, the exhaust air flow rate has been fixed at 36 m3/hr by using an air suction blower to ensure uniform circulation and distribution of hot air from top to bottom before being discharged. The biochar was harvested when the temperature of the bed decreased to 500 °C. The particle size range from 100 to 150 mm produced the highest biochar yield of 26.0 ± 1.2% with higher heating value of 23.0–23.5 MJ/kg within 5–8 h retention time. The gaseous emissions were lower than permitted level set by the environmental authorities. The technology developed in this study should be used to improve the management and utilization of oil palm biomass towards a more sustainable palm oil industry. "

abstract = "The keeping quality for a cucumber, defined as the time the colour remains acceptable to the consumer, depends on the state of the chlorophyll metabolism. By building a physiological model of the chlorophyll metabolism for cucumbers and using colour data from cucumbers stored at 12, 20 and 28 °C, the parameters of the model were estimated with time and temperature simultaneously as explaining variables. Colour data were expressed as ratios of the separate intensities of the red, green and blue (RGB) values from a 3CCD digital camera, namely blue/red (B/R) and blue/green (B/G). The explained variance obtained was more than 93%. The model structure is generic in nature and describes the postharvest colour behaviour in time and temperature for cucumbers, irrespective of growing conditions and cultivar. For six batches, from three cultvars over two growing seasons, the batch keeping quality, i.e. the time that 95% of all cucumbers in a batch had an acceptable colour, was obtained at 20 °C. A batch was defined as all cucumbers from one grower, one cultivar and one harvest. It is shown that, for batches grown in the spring season, high (colour) keeping quality related to high resistance against bacterial spoilage. Model parameters were estimated using either B/R or B/G colour data. Comparing the model parameters, it was deduced that the average initial colour measurement, expressed as the ratio of the red and green intensities (R/G), would be indicative for the batch keeping quality. It was possible to predict batch keeping quality, on the basis of initial colour measurements only, with a percentage variance accounted for \{R2adj\} of 94%. As the basis of the batch keeping quality predictions is a generic model, it might be possible to predict batch keeping quality for many other products which have green colour as the limiting quality attribute.

This paper gives a brief description of the efforts to obtain the basic drying characteristics of candle nuts, which is a pre-requisite for dryer design. The measurements were taken for unshelled kernels of candle nuts, for both fresh and stored samples, at temperatures of 40, 50, and 60 °C and drying air velocity of 0.67 m/s and 1 m/s using a forced convection dryer. The total drying time was substantially reduced with an increase in temperature, and the effect of drying air velocity was relatively small.

The aim of this study is to understand the phenology of edible species within the mixed boreal forest. Weekly surveys were conducted in 481 quadrats during the mushroom growing season over three consecutive years (2005–2007). The initial fruiting dates, as well as the duration of fruiting, were examined relative to year and stand type. Species phenology was also considered in relation to soil temperature and moisture on temporal (interannual) and spatial scales (across sampling quadrats). Our results show no significant influence of stand type on the phenology of edible ectomycorrhizal mushrooms. Neither the composition of dominant species nor the age or origin of the stand (natural regeneration or plantation) appears to have a direct influence on species phenology. On a temporal scale, the effect of year, as well as soil temperature and moisture, strongly explains the initial fructification date but is only weakly linked to the length of the fruiting. Soil conditions influence the phenology of all fungal species but each species has a specific response. For example, average soil moisture can either stimulate (e.g. Boletus aff. edulis and Lactarius deterrimus) or delay (i.e. Cortinarius caperatus and Catathelasma ventricosum) the initial fruiting date. On a spatial scale, soil conditions are correlated with the phenology of certain species; however, this source of variation seems less important to the overall phenology of all species. The effect of year, coupled with soil temperature range (difference between maximum and minimum temperatures during the growing season), shows the strongest relations with the initial fruiting date in six of the seven species studied. That is, the wider the soil temperature range, the earlier the fruiting bodies appear. The stimulation of fructification by a marked decrease in temperature, a phenomenon known as cold-shock, is well known in the laboratory. According to our results, this phenomenon seems also important in situ to initiate fruiting of edible fungi in the mixed boreal forest and could help to optimize the harvest. "

Browning was significantly inhibited by cutting using a sharp blade (thickness, 0.04 mm) and immediate dipping in water for 10 min, followed by ambient air-drying and packaging. Scanning electron and fluorescence microscopic examinations showed that sharp blade cutting caused less physical injury and cell death, resulting in reduced leaching of phenolics and polyphenol oxidase activity and hence lesser browning. For commercial acceptability of the technique, storage studies were performed at ambient, 10 and 4 °C, which indicated that fine cut samples could be stored up to 5, 12, and 16 days at these temperatures, respectively, with organoleptically acceptable scores.

The effect of the washing conditions on fruit quality was investigated after 1 month of storage at −1 °C to simulate shipping condition, and then again after 1 week at 20 °C to simulate marketing condition. Hot-water caused severe heat scald. When nozzle temperature was 50 °C, the incidence of heat scald increased to over 50% for the fruit stored in \{RA\} for 3 months. Combined with hot-water, 540 kPa high-pressure washing increased the incidence of friction discoloration. There were lower incidences of friction discoloration and heat scald for fruit stored in \{CA\} for 7 months, in comparison to that in \{RA\} for 3 months. However, those fruit did not ripen properly as indicated by a high extractable juice content. Fruit washed at harvest had minor incidences of friction discoloration regardless of different brushes, water pressures, and wetting agents. Fruit washed after storages in either 4 months \{RA\} or 4 or 8 months \{CA\} suffered a high incidence of friction discoloration including scuffing symptoms and pressure marking. The firm brushes caused a higher incidence of friction discoloration mainly because of scuffing symptoms. However, no differences were found between different water pressures and wetting agents with respect to friction discoloration. Fruit stored for 4 months \{RA\} suffered 26–28% friction discoloration in comparison to 16–18% in \{CA\} stored fruit with firm brush washing. Extended \{CA\} storage increased friction discoloration even with soft brush washing. The results suggest that a washing system with high-pressure spray, &lt;30 °C warm water, wetting agent Defoamer and rotating soft brushes were significantly effective in removing surface pests and decay control without causing internal or external damage of fruit.

In this study, the feasibility of using power ultrasound to improve the phenolic extraction from olive leaves was approached taking both compositional and kinetic issues into account and also determining the influence of the main process parameters (the electric power supplied, emitter surface and temperature). For this purpose, the extraction kinetics were monitored by measuring the total phenolic content and antioxidant capacity and mathematically described by Naik's model, and HPLC–DAD/MS–MS was used to identify and quantify the main polyphenols. The electric power supplied and the emitter surface greatly affected the effective ultrasonic power applied to the medium, and hence the extraction rate. However, the influence of temperature on ultrasound assisted extraction was not clear. Compared with conventional extraction, ultrasound assisted extraction reduced the extraction time from 24 h to 15 min and did not modify the extract composition. Industrial relevance Olive crop produces a significant quantity of byproducts (leaves, branches, solid and liquid wastes), coming from the tree pruning, fruit harvest and oil production, which are rich in phenolic compounds with bioactive properties. The extraction of the bioactive compounds could be an interesting option with which to increase the value of these byproducts, as it requires efficient extraction techniques in order to reduce processing costs and improve productivity. In this sense, ultrasound assisted extraction is considered a novel technique used as a means of intensifying a slow process, such as the leaching of polyphenols from vegetable matrices. In order to further address the industrial applications of ultrasound assisted extraction, a kinetic study should be carried out determining both the effective energy introduced into the medium, as well as its influence on the extract quality.

Subsurface irrigation with aerated water (12% air in water) stimulated above-ground growth, and enhanced the reproductive performance through earliness for flowering and fruiting compared with the control. Fruit yield of tomato with aeration in the moisture experiment was increased by 21% compared with the control (4.2 kg versus 3.7 kg per plant), and the effect of aeration on fruit yield was greater in \{FC\} than in the drier treatment. Fruit yield was increased by 38% in saline soil due to aeration compared with the non-aerated control. Increasing salinity from 2 to 8.8 dS m−1, and 10 dS m−1 reduced fruit yield by 18% and 62%, respectively, but 4 dS m−1 did not suppress yield. Aeration in both the experiments increased plant water use and water use efficiency (WUE), expressed as weight per unit of applied water. Biomass \{WUE\} was greater by 16% and 32% in the moisture and salinity experiments, respectively. The increased yield with aeration was also accompanied by an increased harvest index (HI) defined as the proportion of dry fruit biomass to total dry biomass, greater mean fruit weight, high fruit DM, and increase in leaf chlorophyll content and shoot: root ratio, and a reduced water stress index (computed from the difference between air and leaf temperature). The benefit gained from aerating irrigation water was not only observed under conditions where air-filled porosity may be low (e.g., in poorly structure sodic soils, or at field capacity in clay soils), but also in drier soils.

Local populations enjoy jabuticaba as a favorite fruit, but the majority of these crops are wasted during harvesting and processing. Thus, the application of innovative technologies such as supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) for processing by-products is important to obtain high quality yields, which increases the value of the product. In addition, processing by-products currently represents an increasing niche market, which is mainly due to their ecological, economic and social implications.

The role of long-term irrigation, symbiotic fungus-host interaction, and microbial belowground progression remain poorly understood, because generally too short experimental settings miss the necessary degree of real world complexity and reliable information from truffle orchards is limited. Here, we conduct the first dendrochronological and wood anatomical assessment of 295 holm oaks, which have been growing under different irrigation intensities in the world’s largest truffle orchard in Spain. The relationships between different climatic variables (monthly temperature means and precipitation totals) and dendro-parameters (ring width, vessel count and vessel size) of the oak hosts are utilized to disentangle direct and indirect drivers of truffle fruit body production. Irrigation at medium – instead of high – intensity is most beneficial for oak growth. Non-irrigated trees reveal overall lower stem increments. Warmer temperatures from February to April and wetter conditions from May to July enhance host vitality and possibly also its interplay with fungi symbionts via increased fine root production and mycorrhizal colonization. Adequately irrigated Mediterranean orchards may counteract some of the drought-induced natural truffle decline, and help stabilizing rural tourism, regional agriculture and global markets. "

However, 1-MCP at −0.5 °C prevents pear ripening, and \{DCA\} can favor the appearance of soft scald, specially after long storage. The aim of this research was to study the sensory profiles of 1-MCP treated (SmartFresh™, 300 nL L−1) and untreated ‘Abbé Fétel’ pears after 20 and 28 weeks of storage at −0.5 °C and 1 °C in normal air (NA), controlled atmosphere (CA) and \{DCA\} and up to 7 days of post-storage shelf-life at 20 °C, and their relationships with mechanical characteristics of the pulp (firmness, stiffness and energy-to-rupture) and sugar (SSC) and acids (TA) content. During storage and shelf-life, untreated fruit softened, more at 1 °C than at −0.5 °C, and to a greater extent after 28 weeks of storage, while 1-MCP treated pears on average showed higher values of firmness, stiffness and energy-to-rupture than untreated fruit, independently of storage time and days of shelf-life. Mechanical properties of the pulp were positively correlated with sensory firmness and negatively with juiciness, sweetness and aroma, the three descriptors positively correlated with overall acceptability. Cluster analysis carried out on sensory scores separately for 20 and 28 weeks samples underlined that, within either untreated or 1-MCP treated samples, similar sensory profiles could be obtained in response to the diverse combinations of storage atmosphere, storage temperature and day of shelf-life. The most preferred sensory profile (juicy, not grainy, sweet, aromatic, quite sour and less astringent) was obtained for untreated pears after 20 weeks storage at −0.5 °C in CA, independently of time of shelf-life and in \{NA\} and \{DCA\} after 4 and 7 days of shelf-life, as well as in \{DCA\} pears stored at 1 °C after 4 and 7 days of shelf-life. In contrast, the worst sensory characteristics (grainy, not firm, not juicy, not sweet, not sour, very astringent and not aromatic) distinguished untreated pears after 28 weeks storage at 1 °C in NA. After 20 weeks storage, the two sensory profiles of 1-MCP treated fruit were both characterized by firm texture associated with graininess but differing for the flavor description, and were less preferred by the assessors. After 28 weeks storage it was possible to distinguish the sensory profile of 1-MCP treated pears stored at −0.5 °C after 4 and 7 days of shelf-life, from that of 1-MCP treated pears stored at 1 °C after 3 days of shelf-life. Both profiles were characterized by a firm/quite grainy texture but differed for flavor, the former being less sweet, less sour, less astringent and less aromatic than the latter. "

The biological effects of temperature, relative humidity, modified oxygen and carbon dioxide levels, ethylene, and other factors must be thoroughly understood by those responsible for designing and operating van containers. The time during which many fresh fruits and vegetables are in transit may constitute a major portion of their total postharvest life. The transit environment, therefore, largely determines the shelf-life or marketing-life remaining in these products, many of the losses that may occur, and the overall quality of product offered to the consumer.

N supply positively affected \{LAI\} (leaf area index), radiation use efficiency (RUE), above-ground dry weight (DW) and N accumulation. The respective maximum values 4.6, 1.16 g MJ−1, 13.4 Mg ha−1, and 383 kg ha−1 were detected with N300. However, passing from the \{N200\} to the \{N300\} rate, the \{DW\} and the N tissue content mostly increased in the vegetative organs resulting in lower total and marketable yield, attributable mainly to the lower number of fruit in \{N300\} plants. N excess exacerbates the unbalanced vegetative/reproductive plant growth which occurred when seasonal temperatures negatively affected crop productivity by reducing fruit load. Maximum total and marketable yield were obtained with the \{N200\} rate and were respectively 155 and 119 Mg ha−1 in 2005 and 135 and 104 Mg ha−1 in 2006 season. N supply quadratically decreased the agronomical (NUEa) and physiological (NUEp) N use efficiency, these indices reaching a maximum with the \{N200\} rate (NUEa = 11.8 kg kg−1, \{NUEp\} = 15.1 kg kg−1). However, increasing N supply decreased partial factor productivity and the efficiency in N fertilizer recovery linearly to 24 and 0.55 kg kg−1. Nitrogen nutrition index (NNI) was 0.8 in \{N0\} plants and increased up to 1.3–1.4 with N300. Under Mediterranean conditions and with the specific tomato cultivar, the \{N200\} rate can be considered the most efficient both in terms of yield and NUE, and the respective \{NNI\} values of 1.15–1.23 (in the period from maximum \{LAI\} to harvest) could be associated with the optimal N nutritional status of the crop indicating that the minimal N concentration to obtain the maximum above-ground \{DW\} is higher than that proposed as critical for this crop. From an environmental standpoint, a 200 kg ha−1 of nitrogen fertilizer dose would put this production system in N balance, with N removal from the field being close to 200 kg ha−1 with a yield goal of 100–120 kg ha−1 of marketable fruits containing 1.97 kg Mg−1 of N.

The determination of phenol content and antiradical activity of fruit extracts in the presence of these chemicals was also carried out. Optimal pHs and temperatures for polyphenoloxidase activity in Deglet Nour and Ghars are pH of 6.4 and 7.2 with temperatures of 35 °C and 40 °C respectively. For peroxidases the conditions are 5.6, 6.2 and 35 °C, 30 °C respectively. The most inhibitory chemicals to both enzymes were ascorbic acid, sodium metabisulfite and cysteine. The highest phenol content of both varieties is in the presence of sodium metabisulfite. The highest anti-radical activity is that in the presence of ascorbic acid. Deglet Nour and Ghars enzymatic browning can be completely inhibited by some chemicals and extreme pH and temperatures. "

The maximum residue limit (MRL) for \{IMZ\} on citrus fruit is 5 μg g−1, whereas 2–3 μg g−1 is a biologically effective residue level that should at least inhibit green mould sporulation. Standard compliance auditing of residue levels of citrus fruit, however, indicate that fruit from the majority of packhouses have residues of ≈1 μg g−1. Poor disease control from insufficient residue loading might further be compounded by the presence of IMZ-resistant isolates of P. digitatum in packhouses. This study was conducted to assess the current status of \{IMZ\} application in South African packhouses, to determine the adequate residue levels needed to control green mould and inhibit its sporulation using both \{IMZ\} sensitive and resistant isolates, to investigate \{IMZ\} application methods and resultant residue levels in commercial citrus packhouses, and to study optimisation of modes of \{IMZ\} application in citrus packhouses. Factors studied were \{IMZ\} concentration, application type (spray vs. dip and drench), exposure time, solution temperature and pH, as well as curative and protective control of P. digitatum. The packhouse survey showed that the majority of packhouses applied \{IMZ\} in a sulphate salt formulation through a fungicide dip tank, and loaded an \{IMZ\} residue of ≈1 μg g−1. In dip applications, \{IMZ\} had excellent curative and protective activity against Penicillium isolates sensitive to IMZ. However, curative control of \{IMZ\} resistant isolates was substantially reduced and protective control was lost, even at twice the recommended concentration, nor was sporulation inhibited. The use of sodium bicarbonate (2%) buffered imazalil sulphate solutions at pH ±8, compared with pH ±3 of the unbuffered solutions, markedly increased \{IMZ\} residue loading on Navel and Valencia oranges and improved curative and protective control of \{IMZ\} resistant isolates. Exposure time did not affect \{IMZ\} residue loading in \{IMZ\} sulphate solutions at pH 3, although the \{MRL\} was exceeded after 45 s exposure in pH 8 solutions. Imazalil applied through spray or drench application improved residue loading, but green mould control was less effective than after dip application. "

In general, more mature fruit, stored at lower \{O2\} and higher \{CO2\} concentrations, at a higher temperature and for longer times are more susceptible to core breakdown. However, delaying the controlled atmosphere (CA) conditions for 21 days decreased the core breakdown incidence efficiently even for late-picked fruit. Together with a proper delay of CA, a sufficiently high \{O2\} concentration during \{CA\} was most important. The model was validated with data of 16 orchards gathered over five harvest seasons in two countries which gives it a wide validity range and a high practical relevance. "

Eggs were either immersed in water at a constant temperature, or experienced changing temperature at a specified rate of increase and from a specified start temperature. Comparison of the estimated lethal time for 99% kill (LT99) of eggs experiencing different treatments allowed thermal conditioning to be identified and quantified. Conditioning depended on the temperature and duration of treatment, being a maximum near 38°C. Most conditioning appeared to occur during the early part of the exposure to a given temperature. Exposure to lethal temperatures (≥42°C) as a target temperature of 46 or 48°C was approached, contributed significantly to the mortality if the rate of heating was relatively slow. Calculations of egg survival in a mathematical model of the conditioning and lethal thermal responses, correlated well with experimental values in terms of both trends and magnitudes of \{LT99\} values. The thermal conditions, prior to disinfestation treatment, influence the response to subsequent heat treatment and thus have implications for the specification of postharvest quarantine treatments which are often expressed in terms of a fruit centre target temperature. This does not take into account of the influence of temperatures and exposure times in the range 32–42°C which can have a very significant effect on the time required to reach high levels of mortality. An efficacious treatment may be the combination of a lethal stress and a particular heating rate which falls within a band, bounded by rates of heating that are too slow or too fast. The use of models will assist in the identification of promising treatments while avoiding extensive in-fruit testing. "

Screens were installed shortly after fruit set and removed a week or 2 before harvest. Screens were of two types, 30 and 60% shade, erected horizontally over the rows. Shading reduced mid-day direct radiation reaching the trees and reduced exposed leaf temperatures, but increased their net \{CO2\} uptake (A) and conductance (gl). The increased gl was reflected by decreases in carbon isotope ratios (δ13C) of leaves from under both shades and of fruit flavedo from the 60% shade. Final leaf area index (LAI), determined by gap fraction inversion, was 10% higher in 30% shade than in the control and canopy volume increased similarly. Trunk cross-section, total yield and size distribution of fruit were little affected by shade. During the second year, however, early shading presumably induced more than normal fruit abscission, leading to fewer but larger fruit. Fruit in the middle of the canopy of shaded trees were consistently heavier and also larger in the first 2 years, but peel width was not affected by shade. Juice content was reduced in the second and third years, but the ratio of sugar to acid was not affected. Mid-day leaf water potentials in August and September under 60% shade increased by 13%. Shading did not significantly reduce fruit yield. "

Texture is an important parameter with regard to shelf-life but was not determined since the ‘Mazi’ cultivar had a high initial value for texture but no changes occurred over the storage period. However, it had the shortest shelf-life. Changes in anthocyanin content were highly dependent on the cultivar. Except for ‘Toyonoka,’ no marked changes were observed in titratable acids or pH.

Modified atmosphere storage is a well-proven technology for preserving natural quality of food products in addition to extending the storage life. Extensive research has been done in this research area around the globe for many decades. Modified atmosphere storage is one of the most successful preservation techniques suitable for wide varieties of agricultural and food products. Grain farmers are seeing advantage in using this method as strict regulations are enforced on the use of other chemical preservation methods. Success of modified atmosphere storage of grains depends on the airtightness of the grain bins and research is needed to find the techniques to improve the sealability of the existing grain bins. It is widely practiced in the meat industry for preserving primal and sub-primal cuts. Modified atmosphere packaging is also commercially successful for preserving certain fruits and vegetables. With the vast basic and fundamental knowledge available on this subject, the research in this area is taking a new dimension to suit the new consumer trends and demands. There are new interests in applying this technique to the consumer-ready products in the meat industry. This technique can be integrated with active or interactive packaging to improve the control over the package atmosphere to achieve superior product quality and safety. Time–temperature indicators on the packages to show the remaining storage life of the food product would improve food safety and inventory control. In this paper, published research on modified atmosphere storage specifically on grains, meats, fruits and vegetables is critically reviewed and opportunities for future research are explored. "

There was no difference in cell size at harvest between the ‘Oded’ peach and ‘Yuval’ nectarine, although ‘Oded’ peach was 24% larger by weight than ‘Yuval’. The ‘Oded’ peaches were also less acidic, and had less soluble solids than the ‘Yuval’ nectarine at harvest. Fruit were stored at two temperatures, 5 °C and 0 °C. Softening was faster in the fruit of both cultivars stored at 5 °C than 0 °C. At 3 d ripening at 20 °C after cold storage, there was more expressible juice at 5 °C than 0 °C in the fruit of both cultivars. ‘Oded’ peaches developed internal browning and woolliness at 3 d ripening at 20 °C after 5 and 7 weeks 5 °C storage, and had lower expressible juice than ‘Yuval’ nectarines. Cold storage at 0 °C plus ripening reduced flesh browning, woolly texture and flesh bleeding incidence in ‘Oded’ fruit compared to ripening after storage at 5 °C. Flesh browning and woolly texture incidence was lower in the ‘Yuval’ nectarines than ‘Oded’ peaches. Overall, the data suggest that ‘Oded’ and ‘Yuval’ are genetically similar and ‘Yuval’ conserves several fruit and ripening characteristics that usually come with peach-to-nectarine mutations. Furthermore, ‘Yuval’ nectarine is comparatively more resistant to chilling injury (flesh browning and woolly texture) than ‘Oded’ peach after prolonged storage. "

The seeds had oil contents from 37% to 45% (d.w.). The oils were rich in oleic (mean 40%) and linoleic (mean 40%) acids and poor in linolenic acid (mean 0.22%), with high content of beta-sitosterol (71% of total sterols), low acidity and low levels of oxidation products, making them adequate for biodiesel production by alkaline-catalyzed transesterification. The high levels of gamma-tocopherol (69–182 mg/kg) may explain the high oxidative stability exhibited by the oil during 6 months of storage at 28 or 35 °C. Conversely, seeds storage under high temperatures and humidity promoted the growth of fungi responsible for oil degradation. Therefore, under tropical climate conditions, when oil conversion to biodiesel is not possible immediately after fruit harvest, it is better to extract the oil and store it under closed containers without contact with oxygen and light, to preserve its quality, than to store the seeds.

This crop has seed oil rich in hydroxy fatty acids used to produce a variety of industrial, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical products. Many of the industrial products are replacements for non-degradable and non-renewable petroleum-based products such as hydraulic fluids, surfactants, 2-cycle engine oils, automotive oils, protective coatings, drying agents, and plastics. L. fendleri is the main species being utilized for crop development, although other species are being utilized for introgression of useful traits into L. fendleri. The objective was to determine field sites suitable for crop production. Two species, L. fendleri and another we refer to as ‘L. pallida aff.’ because it differed from typical L. pallida plants in chromosome number and in oil quality, were planted in the fall of 2003 at various sites in Arizona that ranged in elevation from 300 to 1200 m asl, and −13.2 to 38.8 °C in temperature over the growing season. The four sites included Phoenix, Tucson, Safford, and Patagonia. Plants of L. fendleri developed flowers and fruits by the week of 21 March at Phoenix and Tucson, but one month later at the two higher elevation sites. Plant height, width, and biomass measured during the season indicated that plants at the two lower elevations grew nearly two times taller and wider, and over five times the biomass of the plants at the higher elevations. Seed yields followed the same trend. However, oil contents were very similar over the four elevations. Plants of L. pallida aff. were almost all flowering and fruiting by 04 April at Tucson, two weeks later at Phoenix, and not until 02 May at the two higher elevations. Plants were tallest and widest throughout the season at Tucson until final harvest. Plants at Patagonia at final harvest were as tall and wide, had greater biomass and seed yields than Tucson and Phoenix. These results indicate that L. fendleri is suitable for production in areas below 700 m. Plants of L. pallida aff. were more productive at the highest elevation of 1219 m. It was not entirely clear as to how plants of either species would have performed at the 884 m elevation site due to high plant mortality at the early growth stage. Results indicate that production areas for L. fendleri may be expanded with the introgression of genes from L. pallida aff. "

During 6-d storage at room temperature, pericarp browning index and disease rate of ‘Feizixiao’ were highest. The increasing rate of relative electrolyte leakage of ‘Feizixiao’ rose most rapidly. The relative phospholipase D activity significantly increased for ‘Feizixiao’ but insignificantly changed for ‘Heiye’ and ‘Xiangli’. The relative acid phosphatase activity increased for ‘Feizixiao’ but decreased for ‘Heiye’ and ‘Xiangli’. On day 6, ‘Feizixiao’ exhibited the lowest relative contents of browning substrates (−)-epicatechin and procyanidin A2. Furthermore, on day 6, ‘Heiye’ presented the highest relative activities of peroxidase, ascorbate peroxidase and superoxidase dismutase, but ‘Feizixiao’ possessed weak activities of antioxidant enzymes (especially ascorbate peroxidase). Thus, among three cultivars, membrane integrity of ‘Feizixiao’ broke down most seriously because of its increasing \{PLD\} and \{ACP\} activity during 6-d storage. The most browning substrates in ‘Feizixiao’ were consumed due to conversion into quinones by polyphenoloxidase catalysis. Senescence and deterioration of ‘Feizixiao’ were most grave under postharvest oxidative stress. "

Observations on canopy temperature and relative humidity were recorded during August (just after pruning) and March (during flowering) respectively. Similarly, sex ratio and malformation incidence were recorded during peak flowering season and number of fruited panicles during 1st week of May every year. Our observations revealed that relative humidity was highest (61.4%) in un-pruned trees and lowest in severely pruned trees (53.4%) but a reverse trend was observed for temperature. Sex ratio was highest (35.9) in flowers that appeared in panicles of un-pruned trees and lowest (26.6) in flowers of severely pruned trees. Flowers that appeared in panicles at treetop, had comparatively lower sex ratio (27.7) than those, which appeared at lower canopy heights. Malformation incidence was highest (44.2%) in panicles that appeared in un-pruned trees and lowest (36.2%) in panicles that appeared in severely pruned trees. Similarly, panicles that appeared at the treetop had lower malformation incidence (37.2%) than those, which appeared at lower canopy heights. Further, highest fruited panicles appeared in moderately pruned trees (80.3) and lowest in un-pruned trees (24.6). Fruited panicles appeared in their maximum at canopy top (87.4), but their number was drastically reduced at lower canopy heights. All the measured parameters were significantly influenced by the interaction, pruning intensity × canopy height. In all, moderate pruning was the best for all practical purposes. "

In static cold-storage, ‘Lanes Late’ navel orange (Citrus sinensis L.

In the export study, ‘Washington’ navel orange fruit were packed in cartons with and without \{MCT\} and sent in a sea shipment consignment (holding conditions: 3 °C, \{RH\} 90%) from Adelaide, Australia to San Diego, \{USA\} where they were off-loaded into cold storage (5.5 °C, \{RH\} 89%). After 3 weeks of cold-storage, fruit with \{MCT\} had 83% less moisture loss than those without MCT. Compression damage occurred on fruit without MCT, particularly in the bottom two pallet layers. \{MCT\} reduced the incidence of chilling injury by 42% and albedo breakdown by 54% compared with fruit in unlined cartons. Overall, fruit quality was highest in both trials with the use of MCT. Despite the high humidity conditions inside the \{MCT\} cartons (≥98%), no mould was detected on fruit at out-turn. This was probably due to the industry standard pre-treatment of fruit with a fungicide dip during pre-pack processing and to the properties of the \{MCT\} liner itself. "

During the last decade it was found that ethylene induces or promotes the development of an abscission layer in olive fruit pedicels and therefore facilitates easier and faster fruit harvesting. Two ethylene releasing compounds were found effective in reducing the fruit removal force (FRF) required for olive picking: 2-Chloroethylphosphonic acid (Ethrel) and 2-Chloroethyl-tris-(2′-methoxyethoxy)-silane (Alsol). In most field experiments Alsol was more effective in reducing the \{FRF\} than Ethrel. It was found that Alsol's decomposition is much faster and that it's uptake by olive leaves is both larger and faster whenever solution's temperature was below 50°C and the pH below 8. It was concluded that under relatively low temperatures (below 35°C) or very dry conditions the Alsol is preferable because it penetrates faster and to a larger extend. However, it should be pointed out that Alsol caused severe schorches on the fruit surface which reduced fruit quality when harvested for green pickling purposes. "

This technique enables changes in the main metabolite pools to be studied simultaneously as a function of storage time, temperature and postharvest development. An earlier reported reduction in dry weight of the stipe could be explained by a decrease in mannitol content. At 1 °C storage temperature, no postharvest development occurred, yet mannitol content decreased. It is concluded that mannitol is probably used as a respiratory substrate in gill tissue. Proteolytic breakdown was apparent, even during storage at 1 °C, but occurred preferentially in the stipe. The products are most probably used by the gill and to a lesser extent by the cap to maintain metabolic activity as demonstrated by urea-cycle activity. Changes in the content of four amino acid pools (glutamate, glutamine, alanine and aspartate) proved to be tissue-specific, as were changes in the content of mannitol, fumarate and malate. "

Results showed an increase in total soluble sugars, anthocyanin and vitamin C contents, indicating that a new biosynthesis had taken place during storage. Low temperature negatively affected anthocyanin and vitamin C accumulation, and positively affected soluble sugars, while flavonols, ellagic acid and total phenolic contents remained almost the same or even decreased at all temperatures. Despite differences in anthocyanin content between varieties and its increase during storage (higher with increasing temperature), there was no difference in the antioxidant activity between cultivars, which decreased after harvesting, independently of the temperature of storage. Variations in the proportion dehydroascorbic acid/ascorbic acid (DHA/AA) showed that there were differences between cultivars concerning adaptation of the fruit to low temperatures.

Leaves were dried at different temperatures (40 °C, 50 °C or 60 °C) using a cabinet dryer with an airflow of 2 m/s. Dried and fresh leaves were analysed for their moisture content, water activity, pH, colour analysis and rehydration index. The 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and Folin–Ciocalteau methods were used to determine the scavenging activity (IC50) and total phenolic content of the fresh and dried leaves extracts, respectively. The results reveal that the drying temperature significantly affects selected properties of banana leaves and 50 °C is proposed as the appropriate drying temperature. "

Previous studies showed that P. cucurbitae produced polygalacturonase (PG) in both culture and muskmelon fruit tissue. In this study, a prominent \{PG\} isozyme (PG1) produced by P. cucurbitae in decayed fruit was purified to homogeneity by a procedure of extraction, ultrafiltration, preparative isoelectric focusing, anion exchange, and gel filtration chromatography. The isozyme had a primary endo-activity, a relative molecular weight of 54 kD according to SDS-PAGE, and a pl of 4.2 based on IEF-PAGE. The isozyme was active in a low pH range from 2 to 6, and was optimum at pH 5. Optimum temperature for the activity of \{PG1\} was 40—45 °C. The Km and Vmax on polygalacturonic acid were 44.7 μg ml−1 and 0.14 μg−1 enzyme, respectively. The purified \{PG1\} effectively macerated mature fruit tissue, suggesting that the isozyme may be involved in the pathogenesis of Phomopsis fruit rot of muskmelon. "

In this study, flesh browning development has been investigated in relationship to ethylene production, internal ethylene concentration (IEC), flesh firmness, total phenolic concentrations, and the activities of polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and peroxidase (POX) in the flesh tissues. Fruit were harvested from two orchards, either untreated or 1-MCP treated, and then stored under \{CA\} conditions at either 0.5 or 4 °C. Fruit were removed from storage at 1.5-month intervals for 10.5 months. 1-MCP treated apples were firmer than those of untreated apples, and had lower IECs, at all removals. Flesh browning incidence and severity developed earlier in 1-MCP-treated apples than untreated apples stored at either temperature. Total phenolic concentrations differed by orchard, but no major differences in concentrations were detected between untreated and 1-MCP treated apples. However, \{PPO\} activities were higher in the flesh of 1-MCP treated apples than untreated apples from both orchards and at both storage temperatures. \{POX\} activity was not consistently affected by 1-MCP treatment or storage temperature. Overall, our results suggest that inhibited ethylene production, either as a result of storage at 0.5 °C, or by treatment with 1-MCP at either temperature, may cause stress and damage to cells and result in higher \{PPO\} activity that leads to progressive flesh browning development during \{CA\} storage.

An inoculated tomato was initially treated with a low (0.6 kJ/m2) dose of UV-C light (253.7 nm) followed by immersion in selected sanitizing solution (700 ml) to wash under mild agitation (ca. 250 rpm) for 2 min at room temperature (22 °C). Inactivation efficacy of combined treatments varied widely depending on the sanitizer property. Combined UV-C plus aqueous ozone (1 ppm) provided 3.13 ± 0.47 log CFU/fruit Salmonella reduction which was significantly lower (p &lt; 0.05) compared to the rest of the combination treatments; whereas the treatment of UV-C followed by immersion in a novel antimicrobial preparation ‘HEN’, formulated mixing hydrogen peroxide, \{EDTA\} and nisin provided the best log reduction (4.71 ± 0.25 log CFU/fruit). Organic acids (1%) or their binary mixtures, hydrogen peroxide (3%), and \{HEN\} provided greater than 4.0 log reductions for UV-C treated tomatoes. Treatments were effective in controlling native microbial loads as the total aerobic mesophilic organisms and the population of yeast and mold remained significantly (p &lt; 0.05) low during storage compared to control. Findings from this study provide safe and effective post harvest intervention strategies for produce industry as an alternative to current chlorine based wash. These results may also help researchers design future decontamination studies. "

The integration of aquaculture with traditional agriculture may be a solution to achieve more efficient water use, maximizing farm production without increasing water consumption, avoiding disposition of aquaculture effluents and supplementing additional fertilizer to the agricultural crop. The objective of this study was to test the feasibility of an integrated shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) -tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill) culture and evaluating the effects of the irrigation with shrimp farm effluent on tomato yield and to describe shrimp production. A field experiment was carried out in a randomized complete block design to evaluate the effects of three different water types on the growth of tomatoes: effluent water from shrimp culture tanks, nutritive solution prepared for tomatoes, and water directly from the well. Groundwater (0.65 g L− 1 of salinity) supplemented with \{KCl\} and MgNO3 was used with a shrimp stocking density of 50 postlarvae shrimp per m2. Evaluations for shrimp (mean weight, growth rate, survival and yield) and for tomato plants (fruit number, mean fruit weight and yield) were performed. Daily monitoring included temperature, conductivity, pH and dissolved oxygen in shrimp tank waters. Chemical analysis in a weekly monitoring included major ions and nutrients. The shrimp yield was 11.1 ± 0.2 kg per tank (3.9 ± 2.0 t ha− 1) with a mean survival of 56.3 ± 1.1%, a mean weight of 13.9 ± 0.4 g, and a feed conversion rate of 1.60 ± 0.03. The yield of tomatoes irrigated with shrimp effluent (33.3 ± 2.1 kg per 45 plants) was comparable to those irrigated with nutritive solution (35.7 ± 1.7 kg), and significantly (P &lt; 0.05) higher than those irrigated with groundwater (25.5 ± 2.4 kg). The budget evidenced that most of the N (43.6%) and P (99.4%) entered to the shrimp–tomato system as shrimp food. Within the system, 13.2% and 2.1% of the input N were converted to harvested shrimp and tomato plants; similarly, 8.9% and 4.3% of the input P, were converted to harvested shrimp and tomato plants. From this work, it is demonstrated that the shrimp–tomato culture system is feasible, with a water consumption rate of 2.1 m3 per kg of harvested products. However, more research is needed to adjust the shrimp–tomato culture system in regards to the precise integration of the number of tomato plants per shrimp culture area and to optimize the composition of water used in terms of the major ions (concentration and ratio) and salinity.

The method depends on the use of a reverse-phase \{C8\} column coupled with either methanol/water or acetonitrile/ water as mobile phase, and \{UV\} detection. The method was linear in the range 0.05–100 μg ml−1 \{CM\} in methanol with a regression coefficient (r) of 0.995 (± 0.03). In spiked vegetable samples, the method was linear in the range 0.05–10 μg g−1, with r &gt; 0.95 for all vegetables, with a detection limit of 0.02 μ g−1. Preliminary investigations revealed the suitability of the \{HPLC\} technique for the analysis of the pesticide in formulations as well as in spiked vegetable samples. The recovery of \{CM\} spiked to cucumber, eggplant, green-pepper and tomato was 65% (±3.8%), 63% (±6.49%), 77% (±4.29%) and 71% (±5.95%), respectively. The method was utilized to study the disappearance kinetics of \{CM\} under field conditions. \{CM\} residue disappears following first-order kinetics in the four vegetables with first-order rate constants of −2.80(±0.32) × −2 h−1 for cucumber, −1.06(±0.21) × 10−2 h−1 for eggplant, −0.81(±0.12) × 10−2 h−1 for pepper, and −0.66(±0.12) × 10−2 h−1 for tomato. The higher disappearance rate of the pesticide on cucumber is mainly due to the high growth rate of this fruit relative to the other fruits. The pre-harvest waiting period was calculated for each vegetable fruit at different application rates. At the regular application rate, the value ranged from 36 to 120 h depending on the type of the fruit, rate of disappearance of the pesticide and the maximum allowable limit. "

Techniques for measuring translucency in this kind of product are not readily available. As a consequence, the processes that are important in the development of translucency are little understood, let alone described in detail. Based on techniques used in the industry of paint, paper and textiles, a measuring technique using video image analysis (VIA) involving light reflected from a sample placed in a double white and black background was used to assess the development of translucency and its interference with colour measurement in fresh-cut tomatoes. The effects of stage of maturity at the time of processing as well as the effect of storage temperature were studied in two separate experiments. The data were expressed as the average intensities per pixel of red (R), green (G) and blue (B) for the white and for the black background separately. A model was developed and presented that describes the change in the \{RGB\} values of tomatoes after cutting and during storage. In the model, the observed effects were considered to be the result of two processes namely changes in colour due to the production or degradation of pigments and development of translucency (i.e. physical water-soaking). Both processes resulted in changes in each one of the colour aspects R, G and B. Each colour aspect was considered to be built up by a variable part that changes according to a first order reaction mechanism and a fixed part that is invariable under the circumstances under study. The data obtained on both experiments were used to estimate the model parameters by multiple non-linear regression analysis using R, G and B as response variables and time, temperature, stage of maturity and background simultaneously as explaining variables. The change from opacity to translucency in the pericarp was the main change in appearance of tomato slices during refrigerated storage, for all stages of maturity and storage temperatures. Changes in colour were much less pronounced and related to a small increase in redness for all stages. The susceptibility to develop translucency was very much dependent on the maturity stage of the fruit at harvest and rather independent of temperature. "

Fruit were placed under hypobaric storage immediately after harvest or after 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 months storage in air at 1°C to determine the effects of delaying imposition of hypobaric storage on ripening and scald development and on the production of α-farnesene and its oxidation product 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one (MHO). If fruit were placed under hypobaric conditions within 1 month after harvest, scald did not develop. After a 3-month delay, scald development was similar to that for fruit stored continuously in air. Both cvs. produced \{MHO\} which accumulated in their epicuticular wax when fruit were placed under hypobaric storage after a 1-month or more delay in air. \{MHO\} which had partitioned in the epicuticular wax of fruit stored hypobarically after 2 or more months delay was released upon transfer of fruit to atmospheric pressure of 20°C; \{MHO\} accumulated and/or was produced in direct proportion to the delay prior to hypobaric storage. In another experiment with five apple cvs., the production rates of α-farnesene and \{MHO\} were low during hypobaric storage, but upon removal of fruit from storage after 7 months, the rates increased over a 7 day period in air at 20°C and then sharply decreased afterward. After storage, α-farnesene and \{MHO\} production rates were similar and high for ‘Law Rome’, ‘Mutsu’, ‘Red Delicious’ and ‘Golden Delicious’ apples and were the lowest for ‘Granny Smith’. Scald did not develop on any hypobarically stored fruit whereas it did on all cvs. except ‘Golden Delicious’ stored in air. It was proposed that hypobaric ventilation removes a scald-related volatile substance that otherwise accumulates and partitions into the epicuticular wax of fruit stored in air at atmospheric pressure.

Lcc1 is a secretory lignin-degrading enzyme produced in liquid cultures of L. edodes. Lcc4 is a tissue-accumulating-type enzyme, which is thought to be involved in melanin synthesis in fruiting body after harvesting. Lcc1 and Lcc4 differ in their Km values for some substrates, especially β-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl) alanine (L-DOPA) and catechol. The novel chimeric laccase, Lcc4/1, has properties that are a hybrid of those of Lcc1 and Lcc4. Lcc4/1 acts upon both Lcc1 and Lcc4 substrates and most of its Km values are lower than those of Lcc1 and Lcc4. Homology modeling indicates that the deduced shape of the substrate-binding pocket of the chimeric laccase is larger than that of Lcc1 and similar to that of Lcc4. The other biochemical properties, such as temperature and pH dependency, are intermediate between those of Lcc1 and Lcc4. "

Half of the cherries from each of the above groups was stored at ambient temperature (∼30±3 °C) and at 40–50% relative humidity, the other half of the cherries was stored at cold storage (0 °C) and at 95–98% relative humidity. Each group was analysed for the following quality parameters: firmness, weight loss, titratable acidity, soluble solid content, sugar content, ascorbic acid content, and external color. It was demonstrated that SemperfreshTM was effective to reduce the weight loss and increase firmness, ascorbic acid content, titratable acidity and skin color of cherries during storage time. However, soluble solid content and sugar content were not affected by coating. The results of this study suggest that SemperfreshTM increased the shelf-life of the cherries by 21% at 30±3 °C and by 26% at 0 °C without perceptible losses in quality. "

Further apple rot and patulin production during a three days post-storing stage at 20 °C was also monitored so that effect of further storage at room temperature could be assesed. Two lots of apples of Golden variety with different ripeness degrees were used. Half of each lot was fungicide treated. Apples were inoculated with patulin producer P. expansum strains and stored at 1 °C for either two month or 2.5 months at both \{LOW\} and U-LOW conditions. The extent of lesions and patulin accumulation both at the end of \{CA\} cold storage and after three days at 20 °C were assessed. \{CA\} storage conditions had strong significance in P. expansum growth on apples and factors such as fruit ripeness, fungicide treatment and time at the storage room had significant influence. In general, bigger lesions were observed under U-LOW than under \{LOW\} conditions, lesions being similar or bigger when increasing the storage time from 2 to 2.5 months. P. expansum grew faster in riper apples, although fungicide application was clearly more effective for ripe rather than for underripe apples. Although lesions were evident after both storage conditions, no patulin was detected. Increase of lesion when fruits were subsequently stored at 20 °C was evident in all cases and patulin was detected at this moment. No differences in patulin content were found at this stage between \{LOW\} and U-LOW stored apples. "

This is combined with predictions of future market prices to compute estimates, one for each day from first anthesis, of a factor to convert \{CO2assimilate\} to expected financial value, based on the worth anticipated from partitioning to fruit. A model of the climate and the crop regime is used to predict temperatures and hence allow for the temperature dependence of fruit growth. The conversion estimates are revised to include the deferred benefit given by additional photosynthesis through increasing early vegetative growth, and hence subsequent photosynthesis and yield. This revision also extends the set of conversion factors to include any period before first anthesis. Given the current environmental variables and conversion factor for that day, a real-time system can use a crop photosynthesis model to predict the cash benefit for any CO2concentration. The cost of maintaining a concentration can be obtained from a prediction of the ventilation air exchange rate and the unit price of CO2. The CO2set-point is evaluated as the concentration that maximizes the net profit rate. "

abstract = "Commercial plantation agroforests offer a promising land-use alternative for small-scale farmers in tropical America because of their potential to produce high-value cash crops with less soil degradation than traditional annual cropping systems. In low- to no-input tree-based agroecosystems growing in tropical Ultisols and Oxisols, soil P availability depends heavily on factors that influence mineralization from decomposing litter. Using anion exchange resin membranes (AERMs), we monitored monthly fluctuations in soil solution P in an eight-year-old peach palm (Bactris gasipaes)–cupuassu (Theobroma grandiflorum) commercial plantation agroforest to determine if changes in P availability were related to environmental factors controlling organic matter decomposition (precipitation, soil moisture and temperature) and seasonal fluctuations in litterfall and fruit harvest. Decomposition and C, N, and P dynamics in leaf litter were also studied to determine if soil P availability might be related to species differences in litter quality (initial leaf C, N and P contents) and thus differing rates of P release or immobilization. Although \{AERMs\} acted as dynamic exchangers, they appeared adequately sensitive to detect fluctuations in monthly soil P availability, despite inherently low soil extractable P concentrations. Soil P availability was greatest early in the rainy season, when both litterfall and a cycle of soil-wetting and drying were initiated, decreasing during the mid-rainy season when fruit production peaked. \{AERM\} P was greatest in superficial palm root mats, where decomposing litter accumulates, and in mineral soil beneath palm litter. This corresponded with greater N and P release from more P-rich palm leaf litter. Phosphorus immobilization in initially P-poor cupuassu leaves appears to have contributed to lowered P availability in soil underlying this species’ litter. Phosphorus availability was lowest in bare mineral soil located agroforest alleys where litter accumulation was minimal. Greater overall P availability in peach palm litter-covered soil and root mats may contribute to observed higher productivity in this species. "

The fruit shows great variability in size, shape and weight, depending upon variety, the climatic conditions and the agricultural practices followed during their growth. The fruit can vary in shape, from spherical, to oval and even pear-shaped. Weight can range from 190 to 700 g. Levels of 8 to 18% oil content were found in selected varieties. Usually there is less oil in those fruit picked at the beginning of the harvest season (November) than in those picked later, during the dry season. An inverse relationship between oil and moisture content was found. The length of time between setting of the flowers and ripening of the fruit varies according to the variety. Some varieties ripen about nine months after blooming, while others, belonging to Guatemalan stock, need twelve months or more to reach maturity. The best storage temperature for most of the varieties was found to be 12°C, at which normal ripening was delayed by two weeks. "

Embryos were treated with cold either inside or outside the fruit. At normal fruit harvest the embryonic axis is dormant and cotyledons, which inhibit its germination, deepen this dormancy. This cotyledonary inhibition appears also when non-dormant embryos are standing on their cotyledons on wet cotton wool: a real axis dormancy is then induced. Besides the inhibitory influence, cotyledons also exert a stimulative action: removal of dormancy by cold-treatment is facilitated by the presence of cotyledons. Furthermore, cotyledons are responsible for the breaking of axis dormancy when dormant embryos are treated at 20°C. Abscisic acid is able to induce a secondary dormancy but cotyledons partially compensate its influence. It was concluded that apple-embryo dormancy corresponds to complex correlations between the various parts of the embryo. "

Flavor quality parameters (i.e. pH, titratable acidity, total soluble solids content and sugar/acid ratio) and volatile compositions of these two genotypes were evaluated over ten harvest dates in one growing season. Correlations have been established between these flavor attributes with variations in air and soil temperatures, photosynthetically active radiation, relative humidity, soil moisture, and rainfall, during the growing season. While genotype was the major source of phenotypic variation for pH, titratable acidity and sugar/acid ratio, the total soluble solids content was more dependent on environmental conditions during production than on genotype. Fluctuations in soil and air temperatures, in particular, were found to significantly influence the total soluble solids content of strawberries. Furthermore, the effect of genotype was, for many volatile compounds, stronger than that of the environment. The genotype-by-environment interactions were highly significant for the four quality parameters, as well as for a majority of the volatile compounds. A set of environmental conditions have also been identified, which may be conducive for the production of highly flavorsome strawberries. "

Especially for Doyenné pears the correlation between the non-destructive firmness and the destructive penetrometer firmness was high (correlation coefficientρ =0·82). Also the soluble solids contents was reasonably well (negatively) correlated with the firmness measures (ρ=−0·60 to −0·79). Pears that were harvested too early never reached an acceptable quality for consumption. Especially Conference pears stored at a low relative humidity developed weak necks. On the other hand, when pears were picked late, the rates of firmness degradation and weight loss increased.

abstract = "Abstract The world population is expected to increase by a further three billion by 2050 and 90% of the three billion will be from developing countries that rely on existing land, water, and ecology for food and well-being of human kind. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in its fifth assessment report (AR5) stated that warming of the climate system is unequivocal and is more pronounced since the 1950s. The atmosphere and oceans have warmed, the amounts of snow and ice have diminished, and sea level has risen. Each of the last three decades has been successively warmer at the earth's surface than any preceding decade since 1850 and the globally averaged combined land and ocean surface temperature data as calculated by a linear trend show a warming of 0.85°C (0.65–1.06°C) over the period of 1880–2012. World Meteorological Organization (WMO) ranked 2015 as the hottest year on record. Climate change poses many challenges to growth and development in South Asia. The Indian agriculture production system faces the daunting task of feeding 17.5% of the global population with only 2.4% of land and 4% of water resources at its disposal. India is more vulnerable to climate change in view of the dependence of huge population on agriculture, excessive pressure on natural resources, and relatively weak coping mechanisms. The warming trend in India over the past 100 years has indicated an increase of 0.6°C, which is likely to impact many crops, negatively impacting food and livelihood security of millions of farmers. There are already evidences of negative impacts on yield of wheat and paddy in some parts of India due to increased temperature, water stress, and reduction in number of rainy days. Significant negative impacts have been projected under medium-term (2020–39) climate change scenario, for example, yield reduction by 4.5–9%, depending on the magnitude and distribution of warming. Since agriculture currently contributes about 15% of India's gross domestic product (GDP), a negative impact on production implies cost of climate change to roughly range from 0.7% to 1.35% of \{GDP\} per year. Indian agriculture, with 80% of farmers being smallholders (&lt;0.5 ha) having diverse socioeconomic backgrounds, is monsoon-dependent rainfed agriculture (58%), about 30% of population undernourished, migration from rural to urban regions, child malnutrition etc., has become more vulnerable with changed climate or variability situations. During the past decade, frequency of droughts, cyclone, and hailstorms increased, with 2002, 2004, 2009, 2012, and 2014 being severe droughts. Frequent cyclones and severe hailstorms in drought prone areas have become common. Eastern part of the country is affected by seawater intrusion. Reduced food grain productivity, loss to vegetable and fruit crops, fodder scarcity, shortage of drinking water to animals during summer, forced migration of animals, severe loss to poultry and fishery sectors were registered, threatening the livelihoods of rural poor. Enhancing agricultural productivity, therefore, is critical for ensuring food and nutritional security for all, particularly the resource-poor, small, and marginal farmers who would be the most affected. In the absence of planned adaptation, the consequences of long-term climate change on the livelihood security of the poor could be severe. In India, the estimated countrywide agricultural loss in 2030 is expected to be over $7 billion that will severely affect the income of at least 10% of the population. However, this could be reduced by 80%, if cost-effective climate resilient measures are implemented. Climate risks are best addressed through increasing adaptive capacity and building resilience which can bring immediate benefits and can also reduce the adverse impacts of climate change. Climate resilient agriculture (CRA) encompasses the incorporation of adaptation and resilient practices in agriculture which increases the capacity of the system to respond to various climate-related disturbances by resisting damage and ensures quick recovery. Such disturbances include events such as drought, flood, heat/cold wave, erratic rainfall pattern, pest outbreaks, and other threats caused by changing climate. Resilience is the ability of the system to bounce back and essentially involves judicious and improved management of natural resources, land, water, soil, and genetic resources through adoption of best bet practices. \{CRA\} is a way to achieve short- and long-term agricultural development priorities in the face of climate change and serves as a bridge to other development priorities. It seeks to support countries and other actors in securing the necessary policy, technical and financial conditions to enable them to: (1) sustainably increase agricultural productivity and incomes in order to meet national food security and development goals, (2) build resilience and the capacity of agricultural and food systems to adapt to climate change, and (3) seek opportunities to mitigate emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and increase carbon sequestration. These three conditions (food security, adaptation, and mitigation) are referred to as the “triple win” of overall CRA. The concept of climate resilient village (CRV) has been taken up by Government of India, to provide stability to farm productivity and household incomes and resilience through livelihood diversification in the face of extreme climatic events like droughts, cyclones, floods, hailstorms, heat wave, frost, and seawater inundation. Development of \{CRVs\} warrants establishment of a host of enabling mechanisms to mobilize and empower communities in the decision-making process to manage and recover from climate risks. The overall program of establishing \{CRVs\} have structured village level institutions such as Village Climate Risk Management Committee (VCRMC), custom hiring center (CHC) for farm implements, community seed and fodder banks, commodity groups etc. The establishment of \{CRVs\} was based on bottom-up approach with village community taking a central role in decision making on institutional requirements, technological interventions and supporting systems with able support from experts. In our knowledge, the \{CRV\} network of National Initiative on Climate Resilient Agriculture (NICRA) is by far the largest outreach program involving farmer's participation ever undertaken in the field of climate change adaptation anywhere in the world. Planning, coordination, monitoring, and capacity building of the program at the country level is the responsibility of the research organization (ICAR-Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture). At the district level, Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK; Farm Science Centre) under the Division of Agricultural Extension under Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), All India Coordinated Research Project for Dryland Agriculture (AICRPDA) centers and Transfer of Technology divisions of various \{ICAR\} Institutions across the country are responsible in implementing the project at village level through farmers’ participatory approach. To address the climate vulnerabilities of the selected villages, different interventions were planned under the four modules; however, the specific intervention under each module for a particular village was need based and decided based on climatic vulnerability and resource situation of the particular village. The four intervention modules being implemented are (1) Natural resource management (in situ moisture conservation, biomass mulching, residue recycling, manure management, soil health card–based nutrient application, water harvesting and recycling for supplementary or life saving irrigation, improved drainage in high rainfall/flood prone villages, conservation tillage, and water saving irrigation methods). (2) Crop production module consisting of introduction of short-duration and drought/flood-tolerant varieties, modifications in planting dates for postrainy (winter) season crops to cope with terminal heat stress, water saving paddy systems (System of Rice Intensification, aerobic, direct seeding), frost management in fruit/vegetables, community nursery in staggered dates to meet delay in onset of monsoon, energy-efficient farm machinery through village \{CHC\} with timely completion of farm operation in limited sowing window, location specific intercropping systems, and suitable agroforestry systems. (3) Module \{III\} covers livestock and fisheries interventions through augmentation of fodder production, fodder storage methods, prophylaxis, and improved shelters for reducing heat stress in livestock, management of fish ponds/tanks during water scarcity and excess water, and promotion of livestock as climate adaptation strategy. (4) Module \{IV\} consists of village level institutions, collective marketing groups, introduction of weather-based insurance, and climate literacy though establishment of automated weather stations. Impacts of these climate resilient interventions in the villages were assessed through various resilience indicators, importantly, improved farm productivity, farm income, livelihoods at household and village level. Environmental impacts were assessed on improved soil carbon sequestration, groundwater recharge, vegetation and forest cover, and measurements of \{GHG\} emissions which were correlated with ex ante assessment of village level carbon balance and overall contribution to global warming potential. These 151 \{CRVs\} are learning sites for further expanding resilient villages to adjoining clusters and districts so that large number of villages will become part of the overall adaptation-led climate change mitigation mission in the country.

Decay and other defects were negligible in most test shipments. Soluble solids content did not change appreciably in transit, except in the earliest shipment in which it increased. Ethylene levels did not exceed 44 ppb when the fruit was shipped, and when it arrived in Europe, except in two shipments in which the averages were 58 and 137 ppb, respectively. "

abstract = "A methodology was developed to characterize the relative rates of airflow through ventilated packages containing horticultural produce. The technique relies on measurement of the time for \{CO2injected\} in the incoming airflow to reach sampling points throughout the package. This is made practicable by use of a constant flow gas analyser. Data analysis procedures, including means for their graphical representation, are described, and example results are given for two pack types. Measured data were applied in a mathematical model for predicting cooling of fruit in the packs. The in-pack time–temperature predictions matched measured data thereby indicating that the method for characterization of airflow distribution had not been a significant source of error. "

An experiment to investigate irrigation-fertilizer effects on annual grape yield began in 1978 and continued until 1985. Grape yield increased from 1978 to 1983, with the exception of 1980, but decreased severely in 1984 and 1985. The annual yield of non-irrigated plants fertilized with 1.4 kg/plant of a 10N-4P-8K analysis fertilizer was not significantly different from the annual yield of irrigated plants with 0.9 kg/plant fertilizer. Date of harvest was related to maximum temperatures during bloom and fruit development. Variation of the annual yield over time indicated alternate bearing with non-irrigated plants, but not with irrigated plants. The number of spurs on the south side of the plant had more influence on yield than that on the northern side. "

Squash starches exhibited the B-type X-ray diffraction pattern and had most granules with diameters of 1.5–2.5, 6–8, and 11–13 μm. Squash amylopectin had more long branch chains (25.4–29.3% DP≥37), and squash starch had relatively small absolute amylose contents (12.9–18.2%). Squash starch amylopectins had weight-average molecular weights ranging from 2.03 to 3.22×108 g/mol, gyration radii of 294–337 nm, and unusually low polydispersity (1.21–1.81). Isoamylase-debranched amylopectins showed average chain-length varied from \{DP\} 26.5 to 28.1. Squash starches had onset gelatinization temperature ranging from 60.6 to 63.5 °C and enthalpy changes (ΔH) from 15.9 to 17.4 J/g. Retrogradation rate for squash starches ranged from 41 to 55% after 7 days at 4 °C. Squash starch pastes, measured by using a Rapid Visco-Analyzer, had peak viscosity of 174–233 RVU, final viscosity of 193–244 RVU, and setback of 79–100 RVU, with pasting temperature of 65.6–68.8 °C.

These responses are compared with those of root cells to flooding and of vertebrate and invertebrate animal cells to oxygen deficit. The capacity to sense incipient oxygen stress and, when time, temperature and stress level permit, adapt and so avoid cell damage, is emphasised. The applications of \{CA\} and \{MA\} technologies could be extended if adaptive changes in the plant products were fostered during the early stages of storage. The use of a combination of heat and oxygen deficit for disinfestation is another possibility. A need for more fundamental studies of energy metabolism in horticultural products in \{CA\} is recognised. "
