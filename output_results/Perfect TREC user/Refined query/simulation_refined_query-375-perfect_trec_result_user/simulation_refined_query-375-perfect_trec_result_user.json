      "content": "QUEST TO TAME ENERGY OF STARS REVIVES \n\n\n\n   PLAINSBORO, N.J. _ In its heyday it was a palace among physics\nlaboratories, with an enviably fat budget, ample support staff and\nthe prestige that comes to research institutions working at the\ncutting edge in solving global problems. But today, the Princeton\nPlasma Physics Laboratory, still a leader in hydrogen fusion\nresearch, is so short of cash that it can no longer afford even a\nreceptionist.\n\n\n   However, a dry spell of discouragements and spending cuts for\nfusion research may be ending. With their backs to a financial\nwall, specialists in the field are banding together to pursue the\nelusive goal of harnessing thermonuclear fusion, the process that\ndrives the sun and hydrogen bombs.\n\n\n   Leaders in the field say the new spirit calls for lean,\nselective financing of small-scale experiments as well as the large\nones that have dominated the field's history, increased cooperation\nbetween long-standing competitors, and a lot of patience.\n\n\n   Proponents of hydrogen fusion, the joining together of hydrogen\nnuclei to produce useful energy, have suffered too many\nfrustrations over the years to hope for too much too soon. Fusion\nenergy will not come tomorrow. But it could become a reality in the\nmid-21st century, believers say, and slow the carbon dioxide\npollution of the atmosphere by the burning of fossil fuels _ a\nproblem that may be leading to disastrous global warming.\n\n\n   Pressed by tight budgetary constraints imposed by Congress,\ncompeting fusion laboratories have begun sharing and coordinating\ntheir research to a greater extent than ever and have drafted\nguidelines for allocating their limited resources as they would an\ninvestment portfolio, giving major financing to the most promising\nprojects but gambling some funds for high-risk but potentially\nfruitful experiments.\n\n\n   Next month fusion scientists and engineers from around the world\nwill hold a meeting in Snowmass, Colo., to discuss all the devices\nand proposals currently on the table. It will be the first meeting\nof its kind, according to its co-chairman, Dr. Michael E. Mauel of\nColumbia University, and it signals a growing realization that if\nfusion energy is ever to become a reality it will require global\ncooperation rather than endless competition between nations and\nindividual laboratories.\n\n\n   The main obstacle to accelerated research fusion, many\nscientists say, is the disincentive created by low fossil fuel\nprices.\n\n\n   ``Right now,'' said Dr. Robert J. Goldston, director of the\nPrinceton Plasma Physics Laboratory in New Jersey, ``a bottle of\ntable water costs more than a bottle of gasoline. But cheap oil\nwon't last forever, and in any case, the burning of fossil fuels\nmay be contributing to global warming. Fusion, which could produce\nenormous amounts of energy at reasonable cost with only negligible\namounts of radioactive waste and no pollution of the atmosphere,\nmay be our only practical alternative to fossil fuels.''\n\n\n   No one doubts that hydrogen fusion can be achieved. Huge pulses\nof fusion power have already been generated by experimental fusion\nreactors in the United States and Europe. The trouble is that until\nnow, conventional generating plants have had to supply more energy\nto kindle a thermonuclear pulse than the pulse itself produces.\n\n\n   No one has yet been able to squeeze thermonuclear fuel tightly\nenough and long enough to ignite a self-sustaining fusion reaction.\n\n\n   In the sun, energy is produced when hydrogen nuclei fuse to\nproduce helium, a heavier element. But for hydrogen nuclei to\novercome their mutual electrostatic repulsion and get close enough\nto fuse, they must have very high velocities, that is to say, they\nmust be very, very hot.\n\n\n   Scores of different reactor designs have been built, tested and\nabandoned over the years, most of which belong to one of two main\ncategories: magnetic confinement, the squeezing of plasma by\nmagnetic fields; and inertial confinement, the squeezing of hot gas\nby the implosion of miniature hydrogen bombs.\n\n\n   A magnetic confinement device uses",

      "content": "FUSION-RESEARCH EFFORT DRAWS FIRE \n\n\n\n   A multibillion-dollar federal effort to create tiny blasts of\npure fusion energy like that of a hydrogen bomb violates the\nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty and shows that the United States is\npursuing a double standard on the control of nuclear weapons, a new\nreport says.\n\n\n   The study, published by an American scientific group, is the\nfirst to make that specific accusation but echoes growing criticism\nthat the United States is heading down a dangerous nuclear road.\n\n\n   The nation, critics say, is at risk of becoming a nuclear\nhypocrite, talking eloquently of disarmament and the virtues of a\ncomprehensive ban on nuclear testing while quietly investing\nbillions of dollars in advanced technology that can perfect new\nkinds of weapons.\n\n\n   The new study is by the Institute for Energy and Environmental\nResearch, of Takoma Park, Md., a respected scientific group founded\nin 1987 that has won praise from private experts for its critiques\nof the federal nuclear establishment. Its analyses have prevailed\nin lawsuits against the Energy Department, mostly involving\ncontaminated nuclear-weapons plants, and led to out-of-court\nsettlements.\n\n\n   In its new, 92-page report, to be issued Wednesday, the group\nwarns that fusion research like that now under way by the\ngovernment could be used to develop a new generation of hydrogen\nbombs and that it is thus illegal under the test ban. Some 150\ncountries, including the United States, are signers of the treaty.\n\n\n   The Energy Department, which runs the research program, strongly\ndenies the institute's accusation. The department said Tuesday that\nits fusion research would produce no new weapons and instead was\nmeant to help keep the nation's existing nuclear stockpile in good\nworking order, as well as to help harness nuclear fusion for\npeaceful energy production.\n\n\n   Dr. Ray Kidder, a former nuclear-bomb designer at the Lawrence\nLivermore National Laboratory, who reviewed the institute's report\nfor technical accuracy, praised the group's work as rigorous and\nthorough, and said the issue of a possible treaty violation was\nimportant.\n\n\n   ``This question needs to be taken seriously and discussed in an\nopen forum, and some decisions made about it,'' Kidder said in an\ninterview Tuesday. He added that he and two colleagues had prepared\na proposal for limiting pure-fusion research and that the proposal\nwould appear in a coming issue of Physics Today, a professional\njournal.\n\n\n   One of his colleagues, Dr. Frank von Hipple, is a former adviser\nto the Clinton White House who now works at Princeton University.\nHe has warned that pure-fusion research could result in devices\n``compact enough to be used as weapons,'' a prospect taken\nincreasingly seriously.\n\n\n   Dr. Hans Bethe, a Nobel laureate who was a main architect of the\nfirst atomic bomb, a half-century ago, wrote President Clinton last\nyear to warn of the dangers of ``pure-fusion weapons.''\n\n\n   The institute's criticism focuses on a sprawling federal program\nthat, in all, involves a dozen or so new major scientific projects\nat the nation's weapons laboratories and will cost roughly $4.5\nbillion a year for at least 10 years.\n\n\n   The ostensible aim of that program is to shift national efforts\naway from developing nuclear arms and toward maintaining stockpiles\nin good condition, using computer simulations and a battery of\nother advanced techniques to ensure the arsenal's potency.\n\n\n   But the institute says in its report that the fusion-research\naspects of the colossal effort are so ambitious that they violate\nthe Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, long a holy grail of arms\ncontrollers. The Clinton administration promoted the treaty and\nsigned it in 1996. Its aim is to end all nuclear blasts as a way to\nstop nuclear innovation, which customarily must be tested\nexplosively.\n\n\n   Specifically, the institute criticizes a huge laser complex now\nunder construction in Livermore, Calif., known as the National\nIgnition Facility. The $2.2 billion complex, about the size of the\nRose Bowl, is to be completed in 2002, t",

Stanley Pons and Martin Fleischmann are still true believers,\nas are other scientists and enthusiasts scattered around the globe\nwho still see a glimmer of hope. Even the federal government keeps\na few researchers investigating the topic, though inconspicuously.\n\n\n   Ten years ago today, on March 23, 1989, Pons, then chairman of\nthe chemistry department at the University of Utah, and\nFleischmann, a top British chemist at the University of\nSouthampton, set the world of science on its head by announcing in\nSalt Lake City that they had achieved nuclear fusion at room\ntemperature in a jar of water.\n\n\n   They claimed, in effect, to have tamed the sun, unleashing its\nmight on earth without destructive side effects.\n\n\n   Hailed in headlines as the greatest discovery since fire, cold\nfusion was seen as promising to provide a safe, cheap and virtually\ninexhaustible form of power, ending human dependence on oil and\nredrawing the geopolitical map to make Salt Lake City the energy\ncapital of the world.\n\n\n   Best of all, it was outrageously simple to do. The test\napparatus cost a pittance and centered on palladium rods in a jar\nof heavy water, in which normal hydrogen is replaced by deuterium,\nan isotope of hydrogen that is ubiquitous in sea water.\n\n\n   The two said that an electric current passing through the test\ncell produced excess heat. Somehow, they said, atoms of deuterium\nwere forced to fuse together, paving the way for a new age.\n\n\n   But the dream soon faded. Skeptics rushed forward. And after a\nfew hectic months, cold fusion collapsed as most scientists were\nunable to match the startling results. Heavy blows were landed by\nsuch giants as the California Institute of Technology and a\n22-member federal panel made up mainly of top university\nscientists, which said the reported find was too good to be true.\n\n\n   In particular, it found no credible evidence of bursts of\nneutrons, which the Utah team had claimed as key proof of nuclear\nalchemy.\n\n\n   Frank Close, a physicist with top positions at the Oak Ridge\nNational Laboratory in Tennessee and the Rutherford Laboratory in\nBritain, went further. In ``Too Hot to Handle'' (Princeton, 1991),\nhe charged that crucial evidence in the original claim was so\nskewed as to be ``invented,'' an allegation the two claimants\ndenied.\n\n\n   Surprisingly, despite a decadelong cold bath of criticism, cold\nfusion is still alive today and apparently doing well in the\nscientific underground. Researchers around the globe quietly claim\nsuccess at getting tantalizing results, if not blistering heats\nready to topple the status quo. This hum of low-level work\nconfounds skeptics and delights believers.\n\n\n   ``It's as alive as it's always been,'' Fleischmann, 72, said in\na telephone interview from his home in Britain. Successful tests,\nhe added, continue to show that whatever is happening has to be\nnuclear in nature.\n\n\n   ``It can't be chemical,'' he said. ``The energy quantities are\ntoo large, orders of magnitude larger.''\n\n\n   A Fellow of the Royal Society, the top honorary group for\nBritish scientists, Fleischmann painted a picture of conspiracy in\nwhich cold fusion was killed politically by a cabal of oil- and\nhot-fusion interests, among others.\n\n\n   Over the decades, scientists have spent billions of dollars to\nmimic the sun's hot-fusion reactions on earth. But that research\nhas remained a scientific curiosity, and its practitioners were\nquick to question cold fusion, which in theory was a potential\nrival.\n\n\n   ``We've had incredible disinformation,'' Fleischmann said in the\ninterview. He added that he himself was still exploring cold fusion\nexperimentally, but would not say where or with what success.\n\n\n   The other half of the pair, Pons, 56, left the University of\nUtah in 1991 and now lives in France. Colleagues say he still backs\nthe claims but is bitter over their public denunciation. ``He\ndoesn't want to talk to the press,'' said Jean-Paul Biberian, a\nphysicist at the University of Grenoble who is in contact with\nPons.\n\n\n   Biberian, who said",

Jr., Goodyear, Ariz.\n\n\n   &QL;\n\n\n   A. As hot as the sun may be making you in Arizona, it's not\nreally burning at all. It's fusing.\n\n\n   Burning is a chemical reaction that involves the electrons in\nthe outer shells of atoms in the fuel. Oxygen is part of what's\nnecessary for the chemical reaction. But the sun and other stars\ncreate their energy by fusing the nuclei at the center of hydrogen\natoms. The single-proton nuclei from each of four hydrogen atoms\nfuse into a single nucleus of helium that has two protons and two\nneutrons. But the helium nucleus winds up with a smaller mass than\nthe sum of those four hydrogen nuclei that fused together.\n\n\n   The difference is energy. Lots of energy.\n\n\n   Einstein's famous equation E(EQ)mc &UR; gfsu &LR; 2 translates to: energy\nequals mass times the speed of light squared. Well, the mass lost\nin fusing that tiny helium nucleus isn't very much at all. But the\nspeed of light is 186,000 miles per second. Squared, that's\n34,596,000,000. Multiply that times even the tiniest value for\nmass, and you've got lots of energy.\n\n\n   Fusion creates one million times more energy, per atom, than\nchemical burning. Who needs oxygen when you've got that kind of\npower available!\n\n\n   We can create the staggering power of the sun here on Earth, in\nthe form of a hydrogen fusion bomb. But finding a way to use an\non-going, self-sustaining nuclear fusion reaction for a\ncontrollable energy source has engineers stumped. Since\ntemperatures reach five million degrees at the center of the sun,\nstandard materials can't be used to build a container to hold such\na reaction. Scientists have built machines called Tokamaks that use\nmagnetic fields to do the job, but they haven't been able to hold\nthe fuel long enough to reach ignition, the point at which the\nreaction becomes self-sustaining. That's what the sun does with\nfusion, and what nuclear power plants do with fission reactions,\nwhich split nuclei apart instead of fusing them together.\n\n\n   &QL;\n\n\n   (Readers are invited to send science questions to How&AMP;Why.

Michael Campbell, associate director for lasers at Lawrence\nLivermore National Laboratory in Livermore, Calif., left his\nposition but remains an employee of the laboratory on leave, a\nlaboratory spokesman said. Campbell is recognized as one of the\nworld's leading experts in ultra-high-energy lasers.\n\n\n   Livermore's director, Dr. Bruce Tarter, said Campbell's\nresignation had been for strictly personal reasons.\n\n\n   The Livermore laboratory, operated by the Department of Energy,\nconducts research in nuclear weapons and nonmilitary projects,\nincluding the development of nuclear fusion as a source of power.\n\n\n   Campbell held a pivotal position at Livermore as director of a\n$1.2 billion program to build the National Ignition Facility, which\nwill conduct research in weapons and fusion and play an important\nrole in assuring that America's aging nuclear arsenal is ready for\na war.\n\n\n   The main weapons research at the installation will focus on the\nStockpile Stewardship and Management Program, which monitors the\nreadiness of the nation's nuclear warheads, in part with\nmathematical models and laboratory experiments. Since the signing\nof the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in 1993, the United States has\nbarred test explosions of real nuclear weapons, and has sought to\ndevelop alternative methods of testing.\n\n\n   Campbell will be replaced by George Miller, Livermore's\nassociate director for national security. Miller is expected to\nundertake a far-reaching evaluation of the status of the National\nIgnition Facility.\n\n\n   Jeff Richardson, a laboratory spokesman, said Monday that\nCampbell had falsely allowed the laboratory to believe he had a\ndoctorate from Princeton University, but that Campbell's reasons\nfor resigning had nothing to do with the installation.\n\n\n   ``In fact,'' Richardson said, ``Mike had completed his Ph.D.\ncourse work when he joined Livermore in 1977, but he never finished\nhis dissertation.''\n\n\n   Asked whether a doctorate was required for holding Campbell's\nposition, Richardson said, ``We require all senior managers to hold\na doctorate or its equivalent in experience.''\n\n\n   He added that Livermore's former director, John Nuckolls, did\nnot have a doctorate.\n\n\n   Livermore press releases during the last several years have\nalways referred to Campbell as Dr. Campbell, and he apparently did\nnothing to correct the title.\n\n\n   Campbell could not be reached for comment either at his office\nor his home in Danville, Calif.\n\n\n   The author of many scientific papers, Campbell received the\nDepartment of Energy's 1985 Excellence in Weapons Research Award,\nthe 1990 American Physical Society's Award for Excellence in Plasma\nPhysics, and the 1994 E.O. Lawrence Award for his leadership in\nhydrogen fusion research. He is a fellow of the American Physical\nSociety.\n\n\n   When completed in 2003 the National Ignition Facility will focus\n192 laser beams on a tiny target, which will be instantly heated to\nthe temperature of the sun's core. The targets, tiny hollow spheres\nof plastic filled with deuterium and tritium, are expected to\nexplode in a flash of fusion energy that could one day be harnessed\nfor electric power.\n\n\n   In essence, the tiny pellets are miniature hydrogen bombs, and\ntheir behavior is expected to simulate on a small scale the\nbehavior of full-size thermonuclear weapons.",

      "content": "SYSTEMS DESIGNED TO HOLD A HOMEMADE SUN \n\n\n\n   Scientists have developed a variety of devices and systems in\nwhich they hope to be able to compress hydrogen to the densities\nand temperatures needed to sustain thermonuclear fusion reactions.\nAmong them are these: &QL;\n\n\n   TOKAMAKS\n\n\n   Tokamaks, reactors that are shaped like doughnuts and occupy\nlarge buildings, are chambers from which air has been removed and\ninto which is injected a diffuse plasma of hydrogen isotopes,\nespecially mixtures of deuterium and tritium. The plasma, a hot,\nelectrically charged gas, is compressed within the doughnut by two\nsets of magnetic fields, one in which the magnetic field circles\nthe doughnut the long way around and the other in which the\nmagnetic field lines run the short way around the doughnut tube.\n\n\n   By varying the geometry and strength of the fields, they can be\nadjusted to produce a uniform compressive force on the plasma. But\neven with uniform compression, turbulence and instabilities develop\nin a tokamak's plasma, cooling it and enormously complicating the\ngoal of achieving sustained fusion.\n\n\n   To ignite fusion, the compressed plasma in a tokamak must be\nraised to the temperature of the Sun, and various strategies have\nbeen developed for this. Part of the necessary heating is achieved\nsimply by compressing the plasma. Another technique involves\npassing an electric current through the plasma, thus heating it in\nthe same way electricity heats a toaster wire.\n\n\n   Heating can also be achieved by ducting microwave energy into\nthe plasma, and another technique heats the plasma by shooting\nbeams of neutral particles into it from an accelerator. Once fusion\nis initiated, helium ions (also called alpha particles) produced by\nthe fusion of hydrogen nuclei transfer their energy to the plasma\nand help to heat it.\n\n\n   Dozens of tokamaks have been built and tested in many countries.\nAlthough the United States withdrew from a project called the\nInternational Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor _ a huge tokamak\nthe planning for which has already consumed $1 billion _ Russia,\nEurope and Japan are continuing some work on the machine. But\nprospects for financing the project to completion seem bleak.\n\n\n   Meanwhile, the largest existing tokamaks continue to produce\nimpressive fusion pulses. The Joint European Torus in England\nachieved a record for fusion power in a burst of 20 million watts. &QL;\n\n\n   SPHERICAL TORUS MACHINES\n\n\n   These are similar to tokamaks, in that they compress plasma fuel\nwithin toruses using interlocking magnetic fields. But they have\nmuch thinner cores than ordinary tokamaks, giving them a shape more\nsimilar to that of an apple than a doughnut. Their more or less\nspherical shape permits more efficient compression of plasma than\ncan be achieved in a conventional tokamak.\n\n\n   A small spherical torus built and tested in Britain has already\nproved to have a very high ratio of plasma compression to magnetic\nfield strength. Improving this ratio is a major goal of all\nmagnetic confinement fusion devices.\n\n\n   The Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory has built a somewhat\nlarger spherical torus reactor that is scheduled to begin an\nexperimental program in August. Scientists believe that this type\nof reactor, with a tight magnetic field passing through its core,\nmay be able to compress plasma and reach fusion conditions more\ncheaply than is possible with conventional tokamaks.\n\n\n   Princeton's National Spherical Torus Experiment will not achieve\nfusion, but it will allow operators to experiment with a wide\nvariety of conditions. &QL;\n\n\n   STELLARATORS\n\n\n   Like tokamaks, these are more or less doughnut shaped, but their\nmagnetic fields are designed to shape the compressed plasma into a\nwarped helix with many kinks. Unlike a tokamak, a stellarator need\nnot be perfectly symmetrical. Its configuration is believed to\ncontrol plasma turbulence more efficiently than does a tokamak. Oak\nRidge National Laboratory and the Princeton laboratory hope to get\nfederal financing next year to build a small stellarator of\nadvanced design. &QL",

      "content": "ENGINEERING STUDIES\n\n\n   Some scientists and engineers have argued that fusion energy is\ninherently impractical because a fusion reactor costing billions of\ndollars would quickly wear out. The flood of very high-energy\nneutrons produced by hydrogen fusion penetrates metal and disrupts\nits crystalline structure, causing it to expand and become\ndangerously brittle. If the neutron bombardment were to reach the\nmetal wall of a reactor's vacuum chamber, the entire chamber could\neventually collapse, destroying the reactor.\n\n\n   Most of the latest reactor plans call for capturing the neutrons\nin a metal ``blanket'' (probably made of lithium) surrounding the\nhot plasma fuel. The neutrons would heat the blanket, and this heat\nwould be transferred to a steam boiler to power a conventional\nturbine. The lithium blanket and some other internal components of\nthe reactor would wear out in a few years, but could be\nperiodically removed and replaced at relatively modest cost. The\nmain part of the reactor would be spared. &QL;\n\n\n   INERTIAL CONFINEMENT\n\n\n   Besides compressing and igniting fusion fuel magnetically, the\nfusion reactions could also be ignited by an implosion as in\nhydrogen bombs.\n\n\n   In an inertial confinement reactor, the mixture of deuterium and\ntritium fuel is encapsulated as a thin frozen coating on the inside\nof tiny plastic hollow spheres. For each shot, a sphere is encased\nin a metal ``hohlraum,'' a chamber about the size of a pencil\neraser placed at the focus point of 192 powerful lasers.\n\n\n   When the lasers hit the hohlraum, it emits a blast of X-rays\nthat vaporize and compress the fuel sphere it encloses, imploding\nthe sphere and raising the temperature of the fuel inside it to the\nignition point, 100 million degrees Celsius or so. During the brief\nfusion reaction that ensues, the immense energy it produces is\nabsorbed by a surrounding metal ``blanket,'' which transfers heat\nto a steam-powered electric generating plant.\n\n\n   This will be the basis of the $1.2 billion National Ignition\nFacility under construction at Lawrence Livermore National\nLaboratory in California. Because experiments using the machine\nwill help to monitor the combat readiness of America's arsenal of\nnuclear weapons, part of its financing comes from the Department of\nEnergy weapons program. &QL;\n\n\n   Z PINCH\n\n\n   A variant of inertial confinement fusion called a ``Z pinch'' is\nunder development at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque,\nN.M.\n\n\n   This device would implode little thermonuclear fuel capsules\nlike those the Livermore laboratory is developing, but without\nlasers. Instead, scientists have invented a cylindrical array of\nvery fine tungsten wires and a gigantic capacitor, a device that\ncan store and instantaneously discharge huge electric charges.\n\n\n   When the Sandia capacitor is fired, it sends a current of 20\nmillion amperes through the fine wires in the Z pinch, and the\nwires are converted into super-hot plasma. The plasma is driven\ninward upon itself by the huge magnetic field produced by the\nsudden current. The collision of the imploding plasma generates a\ngigantic X-ray pulse and this, it is hoped, can implode fuel\ncapsules to reach ignition.\n\n\n   The Z pinch and a more powerful successor planned by Sandia, the\nX-1, will not ignite a sustained reaction but should produce a\npulse of fusion.",

No wonder he is more at home these days\nas founder and chief executive of Metallic Power Inc., a\nlittle-known entrant in the intense race to design and manufacture\nfuel cells, low-pollution devices that generate electrical current\nfrom chemical reactions.\n\n\n   Although they are similar in many ways to batteries, fuel cells\ncan be quickly regenerated by pumping in new chemical fuel. And\nunlike fusion, they are teetering on the edge of becoming big\nbusiness. Several hundred units have been sold already, and some\nanalysts predict a billion-dollar market by 2005.\n\n\n   The last steps are not coming easily, though.

Shiely, a vice president who oversees\nnew ventures _ including a research partnership with Metallic Power\n_ at Briggs &AMP; Stratton Corp., the largest manufacturer of\nnonautomotive gasoline engines. ``But this is pushing the frontier\nof materials, and there are still basic technology and reliability\nquestions.''\n\n\n   Fuel cell companies are developing everything from replacements\nfor tiny batteries like those used in cell phones and hearing aids\nto highly efficient power plants big enough to fit the needs of\nelectric utility companies.\n\n\n   The challenge is to come up with answers to conflicting demands\nfor, among other things, lightness, reliability, durability and low\ncost.\n\n\n   Metallic Power has been slowed down by annoyingly mundane\nproblems like making its early designs leak-proof. But there have\nalso been scarier roadblocks, as when Colborn and Stuart I.\nSmedley, his chief technology officer, reached the painful\nconclusion that a system they had adapted from other researchers\nfor converting wastes back into recyclable fuel was hopelessly\nunreliable.\n\n\n   Smedley, a former university professor from New Zealand,\neventually came up with a new design that was much simpler,\none-tenth the size, and, perhaps best of all, something that\nMetallic Power's lawyer believes is patentable. But it took many\nmonths.\n\n\n   ``Multiplying the ideal time for each stage by two has turned\nout to be a pretty accurate predictor of what actually happens,''\nColborn said. ``Our schedule has stretched.''\n\n\n   Metallic Power was founded in 1995 but did not produce its\nfirst, primitive prototype until late 1997. The company faces steep\nchallenges. Not only is it a relative newcomer with far less\ncapital than many others; it is also using zinc as its fuel, a\nradically different approach.\n\n\n   Several venture capitalists unfamiliar with the energy business\ngot cold feet after looking closely at Colborn's plans. Among them\nwas a restaurant owner. ``I spent a lot of time driving to L.A. and\neating in his restaurant,'' Colborn said, but the prospect dropped\nout when it came time to sign a check. ``Everybody thinks fuel\ncells are cool, but when they get into it they discover they know\nnot",

But that's how they are describing a\nway to split water into hydrogen and oxygen at room temperature\nusing a simple catalyst. Japanese researchers now say that the\nenergy needed to break the bonds that hold water molecules together\nseems to come from stirring the liquid.\n\n\n   When Kazunari Domen and his colleagues at Tokyo Institute of\nTechnology first reported last February that a powdered cuprous\noxide catalyst could split water at room temperature, chemists sat\nup and took notice This reaction usually takes place at 3000\ndegrees C and is driven by light. If its efficiency could be\nimproved, hydrogen would become much more attractive as a cheap,\nclean fuel.\n\n\n   Domen initially thought that the energy driving the\nlow-temperature reaction came from light_a mechanism chemists could\njust about live with. But now he reports that the reaction\ncontinues in the dark for hundreds of hours. The quicker the\ncontainer is stirred, says Domen, the more hydrogen and oxygen are\nproduced.\n\n\n   Domen believes that the mechanical energy is converted to\nchemical energy without first being converted to thermal energy.\n``This is the first example of mechanical energy being converted\ninto chemical energy by catalysis,'' he says. But Domen cannot\nexplain how this works.\n\n\n   To most chemists, the idea is heresy. And the prospect of\nproducing a source of fuel by a mechanism no one understands evokes\nmemories of the ``cold fusion'' saga of 1989. But Domen's results\nwere carefully reviewed before they were published. He has also\navoided making any bold claims about practical applications.\n\n\n   ``A lot of colleagues were incredulous, but I think Domen is a\nvery serious scientist,'' says Michael Gratzel of the Swiss Federal\nInstitute of Technology in Lausanne.\n\n\n   Gratzel suspects that something more mundane is occurring,\nhowever, such as friction between the catalyst and the glass\ncontainer causing a buildup of electrical charge. The resulting\ntiny sparks could break down small amounts of water. ``There's an\neasy way to rule that out,'' he says. Dissolving a salt in the\nwater would change its conductivity and the amount of gases\nproduced.\n\n\n   Arthur Nozik, a chemist at the National Renewable Energy\nLaboratory in Golden, Colorado, doubts if the effect is really\ncaused by catalysis. ``I wouldn't be surprised if they are actually\nusing up some of the metal oxide,'' he says. Nozik suspects that\nthe cuprous oxide might react with water, liberating hydrogen. The\noxygen could come from small quantities of the gas dissolved in the\nwater.\n\n\n   Domen says that less than 5 percent of the energy from stirring\nappears to end up splitting water, producing a small amount of\nhydrogen and oxygen gas. But he thinks he can improve the yield by\nlearning more about how the reaction works. ``If we can increase\nthe efficiency by an order of magnitude, then it may be possible to\nthink about practical applications,'' he says.\n\n\n   ``It sounds odd, but maybe it only sounds odd because it's\nnew,'' says Sean McGrady of King's College, London. He likens the\nsituation to the discovery in the 1980s that sound can drive\nchemical reactions, which has led to the burgeoning field of\nsonochemistry. ``When these things show up they always challenge\npeople's conceptions of how energy can get into a chemical\nreaction,'' says McGrady. ``These reports take time to confirm or\nshoot down.''  &QL;\n\n\n   &UR; (This article is excerpted from New Scientist, a weekly science\nand technology magazine based in London.) &LR;  &QC;",

Chidambaram, chairman of the Indian Atomic Energy\nCommission (AEC), told a press conference here.\n\n\nPutting at rest Western speculation that India had tested a\nboosted fission device and not a hydrogen bomb, Chidambaram said\nthey used a fission trigger and a secondary fusion device. A\nboosted fission device does not have a secondary stage.\n\n\nHe said the yield of the hydrogen bomb, which could have been\ndesigned to be much higher, was deliberately kept low to avoid\ndamage to the structures in a nearest village.\n\n\nHe confirmed that fissile material used in all the five tests,\ncode-named Shakti-98 Nuclear Mission, was completely indigenous\nand the tests were the culmination of a weaponization program\nstarted in the country years ago.\n\n\nThe AEC chairman declined to disclose either the depths at\nwhich the five devices were placed or the nature of the fuel used,\nsaying only that the devices were placed in five separate holes.\n\n\nAccording to Chidambaram, the yields of the three devices\ntested on May 11 were 45 kilotons for the thermonuclear device, 15\nkilotons for the fission device and 0.2 kilotons for the low-yield\ndevice and those for the two low-yield devices tested on May 13\nwere 0.5 and 0.3 kilotons respectively.\n\n\nReplying to questions about whether India is going to induct\nnuclear weapons, scientific adviser to the defense minister P. J.\nAbdul Kalam said India is already a nuclear weapon state under\nClause Nine of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.\n\n\nHe declared that India's weaponization is complete and the\ncommand and control system, which is already existing in different\nforms, now requires consolidation.\n\n\nHe said the recent tests have provided critical data for the\nvalidation of India's \"capability in the design of nuclear weapons\nof different yields for different applications and different\ndelivery systems.\"\n\n\nThese tests have \"significantly enhanced our capability in\ncomputer simulation of new designs and taken us to the stage of\nsub-critical experiments in the future if considered necessary,\"\nKalam said.\n\n\nHe told the crowed press conference that the high-energy\nexplosive used in all the devices for compressing the core came\nfrom the explosive laboratory of the country's Defense Research\nand Development Organization.",

      "content": "INVENTOR'S DEVICE MAY CUT AUTO EMISSIONS \n\n\n\n   It's no bigger than a beer mug, but the simple device developed\nin Daniel Cohn's lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\nhas the potential to make significant reductions in the already\ndrastically-improved emissions from ordinary cars.\n\n\n   Cohn, who has been working on the concept since 1993, last month\nwon an innovation award from Discover magazine for the patented\ndevice, which cleans up emissions by producing pure hydrogen that\nis added to the engine's fuel mixture. This allows the engine to\nburn cooler and leaner (that is, with more air in the mix).\n\n\n   The device is quite simple: Fuel enters a chamber, mixes with\nair, and then is zapped with electricity. That creates a plasma _\nan electrically-charged gas _ which then causes carbon from the\nfuel to join with oxygen from the air. This leaves a mixture of\ncarbon monoxide and hydrogen, both of which can be burned up by the\nengine.\n\n\n   ``It's well known that hydrogen improves the environmental\nqualities'' of a conventional engine, said Cohn, who is director of\nMIT's Plasma Science and Fusion center. The hard part has always\nbeen producing the hydrogen.\n\n\n   Although the first tests of the device connected to a\nconventional engine are just beginning at the US Department of\nEnergy's Oak Ridge National Laboratory, calculations based on lab\ntests of the device by itself show that it should reduce nitrogen\noxide emissions _ a major component of smog _ by 90 percent. ``A\nnumber of major car companies have talked to us,'' he said, ``both\nUS and foreign.'' But he said it would not be appropriate to name\nthe companies at this early stage of discussions.\n\n\n   ``The principle of what he's talking about is sound and\nattractive,'' said Daniel Sperling, director of the Center for\nAdvanced Automotive Research at the University of California at\nDavis. But, he said, there are some unanswered questions, such as:\nhow cheaply can it be manufactured, and what kind of maintenance\nissues might it encounter?\n\n\n   But an even bigger question, Sperling said, is how much need\nthere is for such a device in the first place. Since new cars _ and\nespecially the newer cars coming in the next few years _ are\nalready vastly cleaner than their predecessors, ``the demand for a\ndevice of this kind is not nearly as great as 10 years ago.''\n\n\n   The progress _ which Sperling attributes in large part to strict\nregulations such as California's air-quality rules _ has been far\ngreater than virtually anyone expected. ``The new cars, for all\npractical purposes, are zero-emitting,'' he said. ``It's\nextraordinary what they've done.''\n\n\n   Cohn agrees that the new cars are much cleaner, but points out\nthat the major companies are still spending hundreds of millions of\ndollars in a quest for even cleaner cars. Also, some trucks and\nbuses _ where much greater improvements are needed because their\nlarger engines produce more emissions _ run on conventional\nspark-ignition engines, and thus could use the new device.\n\n\n   Besides offering cleaner emissions during ordinary operation,\nsaid Cohn, with his device the engine can be set to run on\nvirtually pure hydrogen during startup _ the period when the\ngreatest emission of pollutants usually occurs, because the car's\ncatalytic converter has not yet warmed up to its operating\ntemperature. Those startup emissions would be drastically reduced\nby such a system, he said. Already, Volvo has been working on a\ndifferent technique for providing pure hydrogen to the engine\nduring this startup period.\n\n\n   ``This device could greatly reduce air pollution from cars,\ntrucks, and buses, using present internal combustion technology,\nwithout a major increase in costs and without any inconvenience to\nthe driver,'' Cohn said.\n\n\n   But that's just one of the potential benefits of the device,\nCohn said in an interview. Dubbed the ``microplasmatron,'' it could\nalso allow a variety of unconventional or unrefined fuels _\nincluding natural gas, diesel, and even ordinary vegetable oil _ to\nbe used in car engines. That's because it is es",

As a precaution,\ncontainers stored outdoors were recently moved into earthen\n``igloos.'' These enclosures proved their worth in June, when three\n155 mm artillery shells began leaking mustard gas. The gas did not\nescape.\n\n\n   Not all releases have been contained inside the plant, which is\nlocated about an hour's drive from Salt Lake City, site of the 2002\nWinter Olympics. In May, a baby-aspirin quantity of sarin leaked\nfrom the incinerator after an emergency shutdown.\n\n\n   Although no one was injured, the airborne release proved\nembarrassing for Judge Tena Campbell. In April, she ruled against a\nlawsuit that sought to close down the plant. The suit was filed by\nenvironmentalists who feared an accidental incinerator release\nmight occur.\n\n\n   The Tooele installation is the largest of eight poison gas bomb\nstockpiles in the United States.\n\n\n   GAS TANKS LIGHTEN UP\n\n\n   Buses that run on compressed natural gas would be more\nattractive if they would lose some weight. Empty, a typical\n300-gallon fuel system for a bus tips the scales at about 3,400\npounds, according to French tank maker Ullit.\n\n\n   The company says that the same system using its newest plastic\ntanks weighs only 1,250 pounds. The interior of the tank is a\nthermoplastic liner, surrounded by a carbon-fiber and epoxy matrix.\n\n\n   Ullit says that 33-gallon tanks can be pressurized to 250 bars\n100,000 times, without showing any sign of damage. Corrosion-proof,\nthey always look new. The lightweight tanks will make their North\nAmerican debut in Mexico City this year.\n\n\n   NEW FUSION REACTOR HEATS UP\n\n\n   Hopes for a practical fusion reactor have heated up following\nthe startup of the National Spherical Torus Experiment, housed at\nthe Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory in New Jersey.\n\n\n   NSTX is smaller and uses a lower magnetic field than earlier\ndevices. ``The modest magnetic field allows simplified and flexible\ndesigns that ease upgrades,'' says a lab spokesman.\n\n\n   Ultrahigh temperatures inside fusion reactors cause lightweight\nisotopes of hydrogen to fuse into heavier helium, thus releasing\nmassive quantities of energy. Unlike fission or atom-splitting\nreactors, fusion reactors create virtually no radioactive residue.\n\n\n   Hydrogen isotopes are also plentiful in seawater, and relatively\neasy to extract. If tests are successful, the lab will propose\nbuilding an advanced spherical torus device that would be fueled\nwith deuterium and tritium. It would be built in the space vacated\nby the lab's historic Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor, which is being\ndismantled.\n\n\n   GROW YOURSELF A NEW LIVER\n\n\n   Here's a breakthrough worth toasting.

      "content": "NUCLEAR STOCKPILE GUARDIANS SQUABBLE OVER COST OF PROJECT \n\n\n\n   In an unusually public display of acrimony among the caretakers\nof the nation's nuclear stockpile, Sandia National Laboratories has\ncharged that cost overruns on a giant laser at another federal\nlaboratory may disrupt the program that ensures that the stockpile\nremains safe and reliable.\n\n\n   The laser, the National Ignition Facility, is designed to mimic\nsome conditions at the heart of an exploding hydrogen bomb. But its\nexpected construction costs at the Lawrence Livermore National\nLaboratory have doubled to $2.1 billion, and critics in Congress\nhave begun to wonder aloud if the project is worthwhile.\n\n\n   Since 1992, when the United States abandoned nuclear tests, the\nnational laboratories have vied to devise ways to simulate nuclear\nexplosions in hopes that these methods will allow them to determine\nwhether stockpiled warheads are still usable.\n\n\n   Officials at the Energy Department, which runs both Sandia in\nAlbuquerque and Lawrence Livermore in Livermore, Calif., publicly\nrebuked Sandia, saying its criticism was inaccurate and, in any\nevent, should not have been made in public.\n\n\n   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said the Sandia criticism was\n``totally out of line and inconsistent with the nation's stockpile\nstewardship policies.''\n\n\n   Richardson said the cost overruns would be handled with money\nfrom defense programs, and largely within Livermore's existing\nbudget.\n\n\n   ``The labs are very competitive with each other, and this\noutburst is typical lab belly-aching that is sometimes aimed at\njockeying for appropriations at the expense of each other,''\nRichardson said. ``While we have contained the rivalries in the\npast, it seems that NIF is too big a pot to ignore.''\n\n\n   Under pressure, Sandia tempered its stance late Thursday,\nissuing a more conciliatory statement on the project.\n\n\n   But opponents of the laser seized on the original statement to\nadvance their argument that the project was unworkable. ``The\nobjections have been echoing around the weapons complex for the\nlast couple of years,'' said Christopher Paine, a senior researcher\nat the Natural Resources Defense Council. ``They're now being\npublicly stated.''\n\n\n   The National Ignition Facility would consist of 192 individual\nlaser beams converging on a tiny pellet of nuclear fuel to generate\nfusion energy _ a vastly scaled-down version of one element of a\nhydrogen bomb.\n\n\n   The laser, like other parts of the stockpile stewardship program\nat Sandia, Livermore and Los Alamos National Laboratory, would\nallow scientists to approach the harsh conditions in bombs for\nstudy. But the project, which has been under construction since\n1997, has encountered a series of problems, including the\nresignation of its director, construction delays and ballooning\ncosts.\n\n\n   Those problems led to the critical statement on Tuesday from Tom\nHunter, a senior vice president for defense programs at Sandia.\n\n\n   Delays and overruns at the laser project ``will disrupt the\ninvestment needed to be made at the other laboratories,'' Hunter\nsaid. ``This causes us to question what is a reasonable additional\ninvestment in the NIF.''\n\n\n   Even though Sandia had contacted reporters with those\ncriticisms, the statement Thursday called their release\ninadvertent. Hunter is quoted in the release as saying that\n``public divisiveness is not helpful in finding good solutions,''\nbut he did not directly contradict the criticisms.\n\n\n   Rod Geer, a Sandia spokesman, said that ``the concern still\nexists'' on how the various parts of the stockpile stewardship\nprogram will fit together financially.\n\n\n   Clay Sell, a staff member on the Senate Appropriations\nCommittee, said that the cost overruns were placing the project in\njeopardy. ``Absolutely, it's in danger as a program,'' Sell said.\n\n\n   Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, who is a member of the committee, said,\n``the project's costs appear to be rising sky-high,'' adding that\n``Congress needs to take more decisive action to prevent further\nmoney down the drain.''\n\n\n   Richardson said, ``W",

Blasted with enough power, they all\nblow up pretty much the same way.\n\n\n   That's the concept behind a series of experiments being carried\nout at the world's most powerful laser facility, located at the\nLaboratory for Laser Energetics at the University of Rochester. By\nzapping tiny samples with a powerful laser beam, scientists here\ncan reproduce the unimaginable violence of stellar-scale collisions\nand explosions, events that cannot be studied directly in any other\nway.\n\n\n   Out of these microscale laser bursts, astronomers hope to learn\nabout everything from planets and exploding stars to star-gobbling\nblack holes.\n\n\n   ``It's a sea-change in the way we do astrophysics,'' Says\nUniversity of Rochester astronomer Adam Frank, an enthusiastic\nproselytizer for the new technology. ``Now, for the first time, we\nhave a chance to bring stellar conditions down to Earth.''\n\n\n   The amazing power of a blast from the Rochester laser, called\nOmega, only lasts for a billionth of a second, but, during that\nultra-brief flash, its power is almost 100 times greater than the\ntotal energy consumption of the United States. That stunning power\nmakes it the only facility on Earth that can realistically simulate\nthe effects of anything from the relatively puny blast of a nuclear\nbomb to the explosion of a star _ an event so violent that it\nbriefly puts out as much energy as the light of hundreds of\nbillions of stars.\n\n\n   That means scientists can now observe in the lab violent\ninteractions that before could only be observed from thousands of\nlight years away, unfolding seemingly in slow motion over a period\nof many years _ and in some cases, millions of years. The only\nother choice, until now, has been simulations in the most powerful\nsupercomputers.\n\n\n   ``We can recreate the conditions of radiative blast waves in\nspace,'' said Frank, referring to the energy and debris hurtling\noutward from cosmic explosions and slamming into interstellar gas.\n``This has never been possible in the lab before.''\n\n\n   The field is so new, even most astronomers and astrophysicists\nare not yet familiar with its potential. Bruce Remington of\nLawrence Livermore National Laboratory in Livermore, California, a\nphysicist and one of the pioneers of the new research, said that at\na recent international meeting of astrophysicists, ``people would\nstare at us'' as if to say `` `what are you doing here?' '' They\nwere initially skeptical when he discussed his research, but, by\nthe meeting's end, he said, they recognized the new method's\npotential.\n\n\n   But laser simulations of space have already demonstrated the\npower to reveal important information that cannot be garnered any\nother way. For example, during the nearest stellar explosion ever\nobserved by astronomers, called supernova 1987A, matter from the\ndying star's center reached its outer edges more than twice as fast\nas theories had predicted. Now, laser experiments have enabled\nscientists to study new calculations of how the process may really\nwork.\n\n\n   ``It's a debate that we're still in the middle of,'' Remington\nsaid, but the laser experiments allow scientists to reproduce the\nconditions and seem to confirm that there was ``a fundamental flaw\nin how people think a star explodes.''\n\n\n   Closer to home, it turns out that astronomers' theoretical\nunderstanding of the gases inside of the giant planets Jupiter and\nSaturn was also off-base. Equations describing how hydrogen gas\nbehaves when it is squeezed under the colossal pressures of\nJupiter's interior were wrong, neglecting a kind of atomic\n``softening'' under pressure that allows it to be compressed more\ndensely than astronomers had thought.\n\n\n   Laser simulations in Rochester revealed the unusual behavior of\npressurized hydrogen, suggesting that Jupit_ter and Saturn contain\nlayers in whic",

      "content": "SCIENTIST FINDS BLURRY LINE BETWEEN FRIENDLY TALK AND SECURITY\nBREACH \n\n\n\n   WASHINGTON _ At first, the questions from his Chinese hosts\nseemed harmless enough to George Keyworth, a nuclear scientist.\n\n\n   It was 1980, and Keyworth, the chief physicist at Los Alamos\nNational Laboratory, was in China to lecture at a research center,\nhappy to engage in some simple academic give and take. He knew the\naudience was filled with Chinese nuclear weapons experts eager for\ninsights into American weapons designs, but he figured he could\nhandle whatever questions they threw at him.\n\n\n   Keyworth had traveled to China to lecture on his research into\nfusion energy _ not about nuclear weapons. He was determined to\nstick to his topic, and not wander into loose talk about secret\ninformation. But a congressional committee, as it investigated\nleaks of nuclear secrets to China, has charged that the episode,\nwhile inadvertent, bordered on a negligent breach of security by a\nsenior scientist.\n\n\n   In China, Keyworth found himself being peppered with\nincreasingly detailed inquiries that related directly to nuclear\nweapons. Benign inquiries about fusion and astrophysics soon gave\nway to pointed requests for information about such highly\nclassified matters as the ignition conditions of the hydrogen\nisotopes deuterium and tritium _ and about the then-new neutron\nbomb.\n\n\n   Keyworth now says he fended off the demands for specifics, but\nhe did respond in one instance by offering an analogy. Deuterium\nand tritium ignite at such low temperature levels, he told the\naudience, that you could just about get ignition by dropping them\non the floor.\n\n\n   Keyworth came home believing he had avoided the traps laid out\nfor him by the Chinese, and had not betrayed any American secrets.\nYet he was concerned enough to report the incident to Los Alamos\nand to intelligence officials. ``When I came back, I used this\nexample many times to show how completely benign conversations\ncould turn into uncomfortable situations in China,'' Keyworth said\nin an interview.\n\n\n   Within a year, Keyworth moved on to the high-profile post as\nscience adviser to President Reagan.\n\n\n   But 19 years later, the episode was resurrected by a House\nselect committee that investigated China's nuclear thefts and\nillicit technology transfers. In its May report, the committee\nmentioned it _ without identifying Keyworth _ as a cautionary\nexample of the security risks that American scientists confront in\ndealing with China.\n\n\n   In many ways, the Keyworth case underscores how international\nexchanges often lead government scientists into gray areas, where\nthe line between vigorous scientific debate and the compromise of\nnational security information can be blurred. Scientists from\ngovernment weapons labs involved in exchanges in China and other\ncountries need useful and creative discussions with fellow\nscientists, but must constantly remember the difference between\nstretching the rigid bounds of classification and breaking them.\n\n\n   And it also shows how scientists view their own foreign\nscientific exchanges differently than do counterintelligence\nwatchdogs.\n\n\n   In the congressional report, from the select committee chaired\nby Rep. Chris Cox, R-Calif., a scientist is depicted as having\ncrossed an obscure line. The report states that ``the incident\ninvolved the inadvertent, bordering on negligent, disclosure of\nclassified technical information by a U.S. scientist lecturing'' in\nChina. The report adds that the scientist ``was pressured'' by\ncounterparts there ``to provide a solution to a nuclear\nweapons-related problem.''\n\n\n   ``Rather than decline,'' the report says, ``the scientist, who\nwas aware of the clear distinction between the classified and\nunclassified technical information that was under discussion,\nprovided an analogy.''\n\n\n   American officials at several government agencies confirmed that\nthe reference in the Cox report is to the Keyworth episode.\n\n\n   Keyworth says he is outraged that the episode has been\nresurrected in the Cox report in a way that he says is distorted.\nHe says tha",

Scientists see fusion energy, the same energy that powers\nthe sun, as being used to power 21st-century electrical grids.\n\n\n   For decades they have tried to use lasers to rapidly compress\nnuclear fuel pellets to such high densities that their atomic\nnuclei fuse, releasing nuclear energy. But so far, thanks to\nturbulence, such laser-propelled compressions have been messy\nbecause the laser unevenly heats the pellets' surfaces.\n\n\n   If NIF works as planned, though, it will have applications to\npure science as well as nuclear weapons and commercial energy.\n\n\n   For example, it could generate extremely high temperatures and\npressures that enable astrophysicists to simulate processes deep\nwithin stars or planets.\n\n\n   Such scientific rationales for NIF are, politically speaking,\nincreasingly valued nowadays as project planners reel from two\nrecent revelations:\n\n\n   _ The price tag for NIF may run $350 million higher than\noriginally projected, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson admitted\nlast month.\n\n\n   He announced plans to overhaul the program and also said he\nwould withhold $2 million of a ``good performance'' fee to the\nUniversity of California, which runs Livermore under contract with\nthe Energy Department.\n\n\n   E. Michael Campbell, associate director of lasers at Livermore,\nresigned from the post in late August after acknowledging that he\nnever completed the dissertation for his doctoral degree in\nelectrical engineering at Princeton University.\n\n\n   _ The future of NIF has been clouded by the recent controversy\nover suspected spying in programs unrelated to NIF at Livermore's\nsister lab, Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. Earlier\nthis year, congressional investigators charged that China had\nstolen U.S. data for its nuclear weapons program; the FBI has\ninvestigated an American scientist of Chinese descent, but has not\nformally charged him with any crime.\n\n\n   As a result, the U.S. Department of Energy, which contracts with\nthe University of California to run both the Livermore and Los\nAlamos labs, has tightened lab security requirements. Some\npersonnel at the labs have privately said the spy investigation is\nracially motivated because it focused on a Chinese-American\nscientist, and complain that the tightened security will make it\nharder to attract top researchers to the labs.\n\n\n   Officials at the conference declined to talk about the\ncontroversies in detail. But during a question-and-answer period\nfollowing his address to the conference, one Energy Department\nofficial discussed the possible impact of tightened security on\nscientists using NIF.\n\n\n   New security measures will make scientists' efforts to use NIF\nfor scientific research harder, said Ron McKnight of the Energy\nDepartment's Office of Fusion Energy Science. ``There will be more\ngateways to walk through, there will be more bridges to cross.''\n\n\n   Because NIF has both military and pure-science uses, ``I think\nit will take an aggressive effort on our part to make sure the\ncoordination (with defense",

Many were deeply dispirited by\nrecent revelations of sky-high costs, technical questions and an\noveroptimistic sales message that would soon bring congressional\nwrath, and its budget ax, down on another titanic fusion project,\nthis one based on powerful magnetic fields and called the\nInternational Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor.\n\n\n   Now, after a series of plot twists, the fabulous laser could\nface a similar fate. Events since that conference have damaged\nLivermore's credibility, derailed scientists' careers and perhaps\nthreatened the nation's ability to safeguard its nuclear stockpile.\nCampbell even turned out not to have the Princeton Ph.D. that his\npeers assumed he had.\n\n\n   But in an ominous echo of his words in Madison, NIF will cost at\nleast $1 billion more than originally expected. If the project\nsurvives, it may have reached its nadir on Sept. 7, when project\nofficials were denounced on the floor of the Senate.\n\n\n   As negotiations between the House and Senate for the fiscal 2001\nbudget conclude, lawmakers must now decide whether to move about\n$100 million to NIF from other activities that safeguard the\nstockpile. The reallocation, which has been requested by the Energy\nDepartment, would more than double the Clinton administration's\noriginal request for the project and save it for the time being.\n\n\n   Saying that its scientists simply underestimated the complexity\nof building the laser, laboratory officials dismiss all accusations\nthat technical problems were intentionally covered up. Still, the\nplunge in the project's political stock has been breathtaking.\n\n\n   ``It looked as if they had all the answers, and they were moving\non the project,'' said Dr. Dale M. Meade, head of advanced fusion\nconcepts at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, who attended\nthe Madison meeting and who specializes in the sort of fusion that\nthe International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor might have\nproduced. ``And since that time, the roof has fallen in on them.''\n\n\n   Even so, Dr. George H. Miller, a former nuclear weapons\ndesigner, who is now associate director for NIF programs at\nLivermore, argues that the laser is the only vehicle for scientists\nto study the high temperatures and densities of matter that occur\nin an exploding nuclear weapon _ except, of course, in actual\nnuclear tests, which the nation has not conducted since declaring a\nmoratorium on them in 1992.\n\n\n   ``NIF is one of the major experimental facilities that we were\nlacking when we ended nuclear testing,'' Miller said. The purpose\nof the laser, he said, is to ``allow us to maintain our nuclear\ndeterrent, and to maintain it in a condition that is safe and\nreliable _ but do it without nuclear testing.''\n\n\n   The American program to achieve tha",

The first is the age of\nrock: helium-3 should be concentrated in old soils, since they\nhave been exposed to the solar wind for much longer. The second\nfactor is the type of rock: titanium-containing minerals,\nprincipally ilmenite, are particularly effective at trapping\nhelium-3. The last factor is the strength of the solar wind:\nplaces where it is strongest will accumulate more helium-3.\n\n\nBased on the above three factors, the geologists have deduced\nthat the best places possible to find helium-3 are the Mare\nTranquillitatis and the Oceanus Procellarum on the near side of\nMoon, and the Tsiolkovskiy crater and the Mare Orientale on the\nfar side.\n\n\nAccording to their estimates, there is about a million tons\nof helium-3 on the Moon as a whole, compared with an estimated 20\ntons in the Earth's deep interior.\n\n\nResearchers say a nuclear fusion reactor exploiting the fusion\nof helium-3 and deuterium would generate very few neutrons.

      "content": "`JUST SIX NUMBERS': GETTING DOWN TO EARTH WITH THE ASTRONOMICAL \n\n\n\n   Famous cosmology books that offer to explain the universe to the\nastronomically inept like myself have always ended up disappointing\nme. Stephen Hawking's ``Brief History of Time'' may have been the\nleast understood best seller of all time. Steven Weinberg's ``First\nThree Minutes'' didn't sell as well as Hawking's book, but it\ncompeted with it in the difficult-to-wrap-your-mind-around\nsweepstakes. In light of that, I opened Martin Rees' ``Just Six\nNumbers: The Deep Forces That Shape the Universe,'' another\nastronomical overview for laymen, with some trepidation.\n\n\n   I needn't have. Rees' book is not easy; portions of it are even\nquite elusive. Still, it manages to be both a deep and an\naccessible book, and it answers a lot of the questions produced by\nnatural wonderment.\n\n\n   The main idea of ``Just Six Numbers'' is that the universe is\namazingly fine-tuned, and that if certain basic features were\nmathematically just a little bit different, we wouldn't be here,\nand neither would much else in the present universe. The force that\nholds the atomic nucleus together _ Rees' epsilon _ is one example,\nsince, if it were just a bit larger or just a bit smaller, there\nwould be no stars. Or, if the force of gravity were only slightly\ndifferent, the universe would never have come into existence. Rees,\nan English cosmologist who holds the title of astronomer royal at\nCambridge University, explains why these various numbers account\nfor the universe as it formed over the last 10 to 12 billion years\n_ and he gives us some sense of what will happen to it in the\nfuture (a prediction based on another of his six numbers).\n\n\n   Most compelling, Rees also shows the deep and powerful\nconnections between ourselves and everything else, the way our\nexistence and the nature of the universe are part of one consistent\npicture. Perhaps it is obvious to some that if the Andromeda Galaxy\nweren't there, neither would we be, but to me that revelation\nbrought a mystical, almost spiritual frisson. We are, Rees tells\nus, quite literally made of stardust. ``We cannot understand our\norigins without the cosmic context,'' he writes at the beginning of\nhis cosmological-mathematical-philosophical rumination. If you\napply yourself at something more than a casual level to his\nnontechnical, layman-friendly prose, you can pretty much understand\nwhat he means even when the concepts get, as it were, pretty\nstratospheric.\n\n\n   Rees answers basic questions like this: Why could we exist only\nin a very big universe? If the universe weren't something on the\norder of 10 billion light years across, life on earth would be\nimpossible. This is because it took some 4.5 billion years for\nhuman life to develop here on earth from the original single cell\norganisms, and it took just as long for the earliest stars to have\nproduced the materials that make up our life.\n\n\n   ``The very hugeness of our universe, which seems at first to\nsignify how unimportant we are in the cosmic scheme, is actually\nentailed by our existence!'' Rees exclaims. ``The expanse of space\nis not an extravagant superfluity; it's a consequence of the\nprolonged chain of events, extending back before our solar system\nformed, that preceded our arrival on the scene.''\n\n\n   Rees then gives a capsule history of cosmic formation, showing\nhow the original element, hydrogen, transmuted into all of the\nothers, up to the biggest, most complex naturally occurring one,\nuranium. ``Supernovae have created the `mix' of atoms that the\nearth is made of and that are the building blocks for the intricate\nchemistry of life,'' Rees writes. When they exploded, they showered\nthe universe with the debris that, eons later, ended up in the\ngaseous swirl that, eons after that, formed the sun and the planets\nof our solar system. This cosmic history explains why there is a\ngreat deal of carbon and iron in the world but very little gold. It\nis because the elements in their natural state exist in the same\nproportions as they were created during the eventful life cycles of",

      "content": "Researchers find new evidence of water on the moon\n\n\n\t   WASHINGTON (AP) _ As much as 10 billion metric tons of water may\nbe frozen in soil near the moon's poles, according to new data from\na spacecraft orbiting the moon.\n\t   If that much water is there _ more than 10 times previous\nestimates _ it might one day be enough to build a moon village or\nto fuel rocket ships cruising even deeper into space, experts say.\n\t   ``Our data is very clear _ there is an abundance of hydrogen at\nboth lunar poles, and we interpret that to mean there is water\nthere,'' said Alan Binder, chief scientist for the Lunar Prospector\nspacecraft now orbiting the moon. ``There is at least one billion\ntons of water, but there could be as much as 10 billion tons.''\n\t   That, said Binder, is enough to build a colony on the moon's\nsurface and to operate a rocket service station for journeys\nbeyond.\n\t   ``We knew from the Apollo missions that we could go to the moon\nand build a base there, but we would have to take our water and\nfuel with us,'' Binder said.\n\t   The deposits of water or hydrogen, he said, are ``an enabling\nresource. You could build a colony without it, but this really\nmakes it a lot simpler.''\n\t   In addition to sustaining life in such a colony, water also can\nbe used for rocket fuel by breaking it into its constituent\nchemicals _ hydrogen and oxygen. Propellant for the main engines on\nthe space shuttle, for instance, is hydrogen and oxygen.\n\t   Paul Spudis, a researcher at the Lunar and Planetary Institute\nin Houston, called the discovery significant.\n\t   ``We've debated for 30 years whether or not there is ice on the\nmoon, and now this shows there is,'' Spudis said.\n\t   Spudis was on the science team of an earlier lunar mission _ the\nClementine spacecraft _ that found radar indications of water on\nthe lunar south pole. Now, he said, two different research methods\nhave confirmed the presence of lunar water.\n\t   ``This makes colonizing the moon a lot more attractive,'' said\nEd Weiler, a space scientist at NASA. ``I think before we colonize\nto Mars we need to colonize the moon for practice, so from that\nperspective this is a major discovery.''\n\t   Binder, head of the U.S. Lunar Research Institute, and\nresearchers from the Los Alamos National Laboratory, both in\nCalifornia, report their findings from the Lunar Prospector\nspacecraft Friday in the U.S. journal Science.\n\t   Lunar Prospector was launched in January and has spent months\norbiting the moon, gathering signals with four instruments.\n\t   The craft found water or hydrogen deposits with a device that\nmeasures the energy, or speed, of neutrons. Neutrons form when\nradiation from the sun strikes the moon's surface. They bounce\naround in the soil, then out into space. The energy or speed of the\nneutrons is affected by the chemistry of the soil.\n\t   By measuring the ratio of intermediate-speed neutrons to the\nfast and slow neutrons, the researchers were able to determine that\nhydrogen is present in the lunar soil, Binder said.\n\t   Ice is signaled at both poles, but about 50 percent more appears\nto be around the north pole, the researchers said.\n\t   Binder and other researchers said the most logical form for that\nhydrogen to take is as a constituent of water. And since the moon\nis so cold, the water is certain to be frozen solid.\n\t   All the deposits are in patches within craters that never see\nsunlight. Temperatures there are constantly about minus-250 degrees\nF (minus-156C), said Binder. This keeps the ice in place\n``virtually forever,'' he said. The data suggest the ice is in\nlayers, covered with up to 18 inches of soil.\n\t   Even more ice could be in layers below two feet of soil, said\nBinder.\n\t   Harvesting the ice would involve digging it up and thawing it,\nusing solar reflectors. A chemical process then could separate\nhydrogen and oxygen.\n\t   ``The only trick would be to build equipment that could work in\nthose extremely cold temperatures,'' said Binder.\n\t   Comets smashing into the moon over millions of years probably\ndeposited the water, Binder and Spudis said.\n\t   An impacting c",

It uses the reaction of\nhydrogen and oxygen to generate a continuous stream of electricity\nfor days on end with no help whatsoever from a battery.\n\n\n   Fuel cells were once seen as future power sources for cars,\nbuses and power stations, but inventors are now proposing them for\nthe subkilowatt world of portable electronics. They may soon come\nto the aid of soldiers, police officers and even everyday commuters\nwho are weary of the inconvenience of their battery packs,\nrechargers and spare AAs.\n\n\n   Some experts say the latest fuel cells may provide a power\nsource that weighs far less, and lasts far longer, than any battery\non the market, in part because of their efficient use of hydrogen.\n\n\n   ``Fuel cells have a simply amazing ability to extract energy\nfrom the hydrogen atom,'' said Dr. Christopher Dyer, a senior\nmember of the technical staff at Motorola Labs in Tempe, Ariz., who\nis the inventor of a fuel cell designed for use in portable\nelectronic devices.\n\n\n   The principle of every hydrogen-based fuel cell is that when\nhydrogen is joined to oxygen, forming water, energy is produced.\nThe energy takes the form of electricity and some waste heat. The\nbyproducts, depending on the source of the hydrogen, are a bit of\nwater vapor and, often, carbon dioxide, which is vented from the\nfuel cell.\n\n\n   Give the fuel cells enough hydrogen, plus the oxygen that is\nprovided free in the atmosphere, Dyer said, and they could power\ndevices like cell phones for days, weeks or even months. The\nhydrogen that drives these small marvels will probably be provided\nby methanol, a compound commonly known as wood alcohol that\ncontains hydrogen, Dyer said.\n\n\n   ``A liter of methanol should provide enough electricity to run a\nlaptop for more than a week,'' Dyer said. ``A lithium ion battery\nof comparable volume has a tenth of that energy.'' Lithium ion\nbatteries, commonly used in laptops, each provide about three hours\nof energy.\n\n\n   Fuel cells have another advantage besides a high energy output,\nDyer said. They can be replenished quickly, unlike batteries, which\nrequire a slow recharging. Dyer imagines that owners of cell\nphones, laptops and pagers will someday refuel their devices by\noccasionally slipping in a new ampul of methanol.\n\n\n   ``Methanol is inexpensive,'' Dyer said. ``Ampuls of it could be\nbought from a supermarket.''\n\n\n   Fuel cells are not new devices, although the intense recent\ninterest in them is. They were demonstrated in the 19th century and\ndeployed more than a century later to power NASA's space vehicles.\nBut the internal processing required to produce that continuous\nstream of electricity high in the sky proved too expensive for\ndaily applications.\n\n\n   That is changing now, as engineering advances have gradually\nlowered costs. At the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency in\nArlington, Va., Robert Nowak, a program manager, said research\nsponsored by the agency would aid the overladen American soldiers\nwho routinely carry 20 to 30 pounds of batteries on their missions.\n\n\n   ``Fuel cells begin to look very attractive when you consider\nwhat you need in the equivalent battery power to run a computer,\nradio and other gear soldiers must often take with them,'' he said.\n\n\n   But Nowak has not entirely banished batteries from the fuel\ncells his agency has helped to develop. Like many people in the\nfield, he supports a hybrid, or dual, system that uses both a\nbattery and a small fuel cell. The battery provides peaks of power\nwhen needed, and the fuel cell keeps the battery recharged.\n\n\n   ``In principle this means you will only add fuel to the cell\nfrom time to time,'' Nowak said. ``The battery will supply any\ntransient power that exc",

      "content": "WORLD MOVING SLOWLY TOWARD ENERGY FREE OF CARBON \n\n\n\n   Even as the world's expanding population and economy increase\natmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide that scientists say\nare warming the earth, the global energy system is moving steadily\naway from the carbon-rich fuels whose combustion produces the gas.\n\n\n   Experts say that atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide may be\ndouble those of the pre-industrial era by the end of the next\ncentury. But they also say the levels would be much higher except\nfor a trend toward lower-carbon fuels that has been going on for\nmore than 100 years, but has been largely unnoticed except by a\nsmall band of energy specialists.\n\n\n   The question now, they say, is whether the trend can be\naccelerated enough to stave off or lessen what many scientists\nbelieve is a potentially disruptive global warming.\n\n\n   For nearly a century and a half, fuels with high amounts of\ncarbon have progressively been replaced by those containing less.\nFirst wood, which is high in carbon, was eclipsed in the late 19th\ncentury by coal, which contains less. Then oil, with a lower carbon\ncontent still, dethroned King Coal in the 1960s.\n\n\n   Now analysts say that natural gas, lighter still in carbon, may\nbe entering its heyday, and that the day of hydrogen _ providing a\nfuel with no carbon at all, by definition _ may at last be about to\ndawn.\n\n\n   As a result, the experts estimate, the world's economy today\nburns less than two-thirds as much carbon per unit of energy\nproduced as it did in 1860. In the United States, they estimate,\nthe trend toward lower-carbon fuels combined with greater energy\nefficiency has, since 1950, reduced by about half the amount of\ncarbon spewed out for each unit of economic production.\n\n\n   But because economic growth and population growth have been so\nrapid over the decades, overall atmospheric concentrations of\ncarbon dioxide have steadily risen, to the point that the\nconcentrations may well have doubled by the year 2100. Mainstream\nscientists say that this much carbon dioxide could warm the earth,\non average, by 3 to 5 degrees Fahrenheit. By comparison, that is\nabout half as much as it has warmed since the depths of the last\nice age 18,000 to 20,000 years ago. A change of this magnitude\nwould likely have widespread consequences for the world's climate,\nweather and human life.\n\n\n   Now, as representatives of 150 governments meet in Bonn,\nGermany, in the latest round of global talks on measures to further\nreduce carbon-dioxide emissions, analysts both in and out of\nindustry say that the next quarter-century is shaping up as a\nperiod of technological and economic ferment offering a chance to\naccelerate the trend toward a low-carbon economy and, eventually, a\nno-carbon one.\n\n\n   In Bonn, the delegates are trying to work out the details of an\nagreement forged two years ago in Kyoto, Japan, that could speed up\nthe trend. Their work is not expected to be finished for at least a\nyear, and the Kyoto agreement still must be ratified by a\nsufficient number of countries after that.\n\n\n   However that may turn out, ``the decarbonization of the energy\nsystem is the single most important fact to emerge from the last 20\nyears of analysis'' of the system, said Dr. Jesse Ausubel, an\nexpert on energy and climate at Rockefeller University in New York\nCity. He predicts that this evolution will produce a carbon-free\nenergy system by the end of the 21st century.\n\n\n   Among some recent signs of the trend are these:\n\n\n   _ The federal Energy Information Administration reported last\nweek that emissions of carbon dioxide by the United States had\nincreased by an average of 1.37 percent a year in the 1990s _ only\nabout half the 2.6-percent rate of growth in economic production.\nAnalysts say the discrepancy is evidence that the economy is being\ndecoupled from carbon.\n\n\n   _ The agency reported this month that the same is generally true\nin China, the biggest consumer and producer of coal in the world,\nwhere coal production has been reported to be dropping lately.\n``China has dispelled a commonly held notion th",

The\nBallard cell is simply refueled with compressed hydrogen when it\nruns low.\n\n\n   If the skeptic in you is wondering where these cars with Ballard\nfuel cells are and where this compressed hydrogen will come from,\nconsider this: DaimlerChrysler has a prototype car on the road in\nGermany and plans to put fuel cell cars on the market by 2004,\nalong with Toyota and General Motors.\n\n\n   Shell, Texaco and Arco are working on developing the fuel\ninfrastructure with compressed hydrogen necessary to run these\ncars.\n\n\n   Sound too good to be true? Considering that it was developed by\na few scientists and engineers working for next to nothing in a\nlittle Canadian town, such an energy source does seem almost\nunbelievable.\n\n\n   Which makes for a terrific book, written by journalist Tom\nKoppel.\n\n\n   ``The Ballard fuel cell promises nothing less than to solve some\nof the world's worst air pollution problems,'' he writes. ``Yet, it\nall began with a handful of people working on shoestring budgets\nfor a tiny Canadian company, Ballard Power Systems, in a\nlittle-known city of North Vancouver.''\n\n\n   Development and implementation of the Ballard fuel cell is\ndiscussed in Koppel's book, ``Powering the Future: The Ballard Fuel\nCell and the Race to Change the World'' (John Wiley &AMP; Sons, 276\npages).\n\n\n   Geoffrey Ballard, a citizen of Canada and the United States\nthrough his parents, did not set out to find an environmentally\nfriendly energy source, Koppel writes. Ballard became interested in\nthe idea when he was director of research for the newly formed\nconservation office of the Army during the energy crisis of 1973.\n\n\n   Ballard quickly realized that conservation was not a practical\nmeans to solve air pollution problems or U.S. dependence on foreign\noil. Instead, a cleaner energy source had to be discovered, he\ndecided.\n\n\n   So Ballard quit his well-paid job to start a company to create\nsuch an energy source. Tight money forced Ballard and his wife and\nchildren to start a restaurant to finance his dream, Koppel writes\nas he deftly chronicles the ups and downs of such an\nentrepreneurial effort.\n\n\n   ``In short, taking the Ballard fuel cell to where it is today\ntook inspiration, perspiration, and a heavy dose of serendipity,''\nhe writes.\n\n\n   Interestingly, as the company began to succeed, so did its\nstock. Now 35 percent owned by DaimlerChrysler and Ford, Ballard\nPower Systems stock is up tenfold in the past three years. Daimler\nand Ballard also agreed to create a separate company called Ballard\nAutomotive that would be owned jointly and would market the fuel\ncells and fuel cell engines made by DBB.\n\n\n   Although Ballard is a millionaire several times over, money may\nbe the least of his interests.\n\n\n   As he told students graduating from the University of Victoria,\nBritish Columbia: ``Do not be patient. All things to do not come to\nthose who wait. Challenge the normal. Question conventional wisdom.\n... Dare to be in a hurry to change things for the better.''\n\n\n   Ballard was in a hurry, and his urgency may help us all breathe\na little better.\n\n\n   (Visit the Star-Telegram's online services on the World Wide\nWeb: www.star-telegram.com) &QL; \nnn",

      "content": "A LEADING ALTERNATIVE TO NUCLEAR TESTS FALTERS\n\n\n\n   Since late August, an effort to build the world's largest laser\nhas suffered a series of embarrassments that have tarnished the\nproject's reputation and undermined its role as leading\njustification for a ban on nuclear tests.\n\n\n   Now Energy Secretary Bill Richardson says the entire project and\nits management may have to be restructured, amid soaring cost\noverruns. And at least one senator has raised questions about\nwhether tiny nuclear explosions to be triggered by the lasers would\nviolate the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.\n\n\n   In the National Ignition Facility, or NIF, as the project is\nknown, powerful lasers would be used to create conditions similar\nto those in nuclear weapons, allowing scientists to study the\nreliability of the nation's nuclear stockpile without tests. The\nlasers, under construction at the Energy Department's Lawrence\nLivermore National Laboratory in California, would crush and heat\npellets of nuclear fuel with 192 converging beams, generating a\nrapid release of fusion energy.\n\n\n   That release would create conditions similar to those created by\nnuclear weapons, allowing scientists to study their properties.\nGovernment scientists say that the laser project is a crucial\ncomponent of the nation's effort to ensure the safety and\nreliability of its aging nuclear stockpile without actually testing\nthe weapons in nuclear explosions.\n\n\n   Beyond its applications to weapons, moreover, physicists hope\nthat NIF will help them understand the behavior of materials under\nextreme conditions and explore the possibility that nuclear fusion\ncould be used for the peaceful generation of power.\n\n\n   But NIF, originally estimated to cost $1.2 billion, has been\nplagued by scheduling delays, technical problems and cost overruns\nthat could go as high as a third of that figure. Its former\ndirector, E. Michael Campbell, took a leave of absence in August\nafter questions arose about his academic credentials and announced\nlast week that he was resigning from the laboratory. And even\nthough $800 million has been spent and construction has been under\nway since 1997, unhappiness in Congress with the overruns means the\nproject faces the threat of cancellation. In the latest blow, a\nletter to Richardson in late October, Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa,\nquestioned whether such experiments themselves might violate the\n``zero yield'' provision in Article I of the treaty, which would\nprohibit any nuclear test of any size. Successful experiments on\nNIF would release the energy equivalent of about 15 pounds of TNT\nin an extremely small fraction of a second within a contained\nvessel.\n\n\n   ``It is troubling that we are planning to ignite thermonuclear\nexplosions at NIF that may violate the Comprehensive Test Ban\nTreaty's ban on nuclear explosions,'' Harkin said in a statement on\nthe letter, citing the administration's pledge not to test while\ncontinuing to seek ratification of the treaty, which he also\nsupports.\n\n\n   Asked about the letter, officials at the State Department and\nthe Energy Department said that laser fusion experiments of lower\npower had always been granted special exemptions during\nnegotiations for test ban treaties, including the latest one.\n\n\n   ``I think it's a fair question that deserves an answer,'' John\nHolum, senior adviser to the secretary of state for arms control\nand international security, said of the issue Harkin had raised.\nHolum, who helped negotiate the test ban treaty, added that during\nnegotiations with other parties to the treaty, ``we specifically\ncarved out that activity as something we expected to continue under\na zero yield treaty.''\n\n\n   But the brevity of the Senate's debate on the beleaguered treaty\nprecluded a full discussion of such points, Holum said. The Senate\nrefused to ratify the treaty in October but the Clinton\nadministration still supports the treaty. While the treaty has\nlittle chance of passage next year, it is likely to be a campaign\nissue.\n\n\n   More serious consequences for the program could emerge from\nRichardson's recent finding that co",

But the expense of building new high-energy machines runs to\nbillions of dollars, and the era of giant particle accelerators may\nbe approaching its twilight.\n\n\n   Machines that smashed subatomic particles together at energies\nlike that of the Big Bang greatly expanded the horizons of\nphysicists, cosmologists and philosophers in the past few decades,\nand in the near future they are likely to answer some intriguing\nquestions.\n\n\n   Some examples: What is it that endows all matter with mass? Is\nthere an underlying framework in the universe that ties together\ngravity with the other forces of nature? Do supposedly fundamental\nparticles like quarks and leptons actually have internal structure?\nWhat is the mechanism that created more matter than antimatter in\nthe universal creation event, so that enough matter was left over\nafter the mutual annihilation to build the universe?\n\n\n   Physicists hope that answers to these and other puzzles will\nemerge from the handful of accelerator laboratories working at the\nfrontiers of physics. But the big question is whether the world's\ngovernments are willing to spend the money for such knowledge.\n\n\n   Existing accelerator projects are maintaining the research\nmomentum in the United States. Both SLAC and Fermilab, which have\nbeen upgrading their accelerators, are still making important\ndiscoveries.\n\n\n   But in 2005, a proton accelerator with a circumference of 17\nmiles, the Large Hadron Collider, is to begin operating at CERN.\nFrom then on, particle physicists agree, the center of high-energy\nresearch will shift to Europe.\n\n\n   Because the retiring directors have presided over a critical\nperiod of accelerator physics, colleagues regard their passing as\nbench marks.\n\n\n   Richter, 67, will leave the directorship of SLAC on Aug. 31\nafter 15 years as chief. While in his 30s, he pioneered the\ndevelopment of colliding-beam accelerators, in which opposing beams\nof particles slam into each other head-on, creating showers of\ndebris and new particles.\n\n\n   In 1974, using beams of electrons and antielectrons, or\npositrons, Richter discovered a particle that came to be called\nPsi/J. It contained two quarks possessing a previously unknown\nflavor called charm. For this discovery, Richter and Dr. Samuel\nC.C. Ting of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology shared the\n1976 Nobel Prize in Physics.\n\n\n   Peoples, 66, director of Fermilab, will retire on June 30 after\n28 years there, 10 as director. Peoples directed the development of\na source of antiprotons for use in the colliding beams of\nFermilab's gigantic Tevatron accelerator.\n\n\n   In the past few years his main concern has been building a new\nmain injector for the Tevatron, which will soon increase the flow\nof particles in the opposing beams from a trickle to torrents.

Kral of the University of Arkansas said that a  \nmethane-making, oxygen-hating microbe ``grows just fine and dandy'' \nin a simulated Martian environment that could not support most \nforms of life on Earth. \n\n\n\tKral, who is reporting on his research today at the national  \nmeeting of the American Society for Microbiology, said he and a \ncolleague, Curtis Bekkum, created an environment in culture dishes \nthat closely mimics the environment of Mars. \n\n\n\tThe dishes contained no oxygen, but were bathed in carbon  \ndioxide and hydrogen gases. The soil in the experiment resembles \nwhat is known about Martian dirt, with no organic nutrients and \nonly a small trace of water. \n\n\n\t``We make the assumption that there is liquid water beneath the  \nsurface,'' said Kral. Many planet experts believe Mars once had \ngreat amounts of water and that traces of it still remain beneath \nthe surface. \n\n\n\tInto this mix, the researchers placed a group of microbes called  \nmethanogens, a type of bacteria that on Earth lives in places where \nthere is no oxygen, such as deep under the ground or around sea \nfloor vents. Some types of methanogens even live in the stomachs of \ncows, where they help digest grass. \n\n\n\tAll of these types of microbes, he said, use nitrogen and  \nhydrogen to make methane, a natural gas that can be used as fuel. \n\n\n\tTo determine whether the bacteria lived in the simulated Martian  \nenvironment, Kral said he measured the amount of methane produced \ninside the sealed culture dishes. \n\n\n\t``It made methane just like it does on Earth,'' he said. ``It  \ngrows just fine in the Martian conditions.'' \n\n\n\tAlthough the experiment is far from the final answer, Kral said  \nthe fact that the microbes thrived ``cautiously increases our \nbelief that life on Mars is possible, or at least it was \npossible.'' \n\n\n\tKral said the experiment also raises the possibility that the  \nmicrobes could be used to cause a change in the planetary climate \nof Mars. \n\n\n\t``If man were to go to Mars someday and introduce life, this  \nmight be the form of life that would grow there,'' he said. ``If \nyou were going to try to create an Earthlike conditions there, \nputting this type of organism on Mars might be the thing to start \nit.'' \n\n\n\tKral said colonies of methanogens would give off methane gas  \nthat could help change the climate and temperature of Mars. The \nplanet surface now is very cold; but if methane collected in the \natmosphere, it eventually could create a greenhouse effect, he \nsaid. \n\n\n\t``Methane is a greenhouse gas, which means you could warm up the  \nplanet,'' he said. Greenhouse gases allow sunlight to hit the \nplanet's surface, but prevent the solar heat from escaping back \ninto space. \n\n\n\tMethane also could provide the energy for a human colony on  \nMars, said Kral. The gas can be used as fuel and could even be \nprocessed into a rocket propellant. \n\n\n\tNASA has been studying the idea of one day sending a  \nmethane-producing robot spacecraft to Mars, Kral said. Using \nhydrogen brought from Earth and carbon dioxide from the Martian \natmosphere, it would be possible to make and store methane, he \nsaid. The fuel then would be available when people are eventually \nsent to Mars. \n\n\n\t``They could use the methane to rocket themselves back to  \nEarth,'' he said. \n\n\n\tMethanogen microbes, in theory, also could be used on Mars to  \nmake methane and provide the energy needed for a human colony \nthere, Kral said.",

Environmentalists like it, because its\nexhaust is water. And, after some initial hesitation, the world's\ncar makers are now investing heavily in turning it into a practical\nreality.\n\n\n   The latest prototype comes from General Motors. The archly named\nHydroGen1 is a third of the size of the company's previous version,\nyet it produces about 60 percent more power _ 80 kilowatts, the\nequivalent of an average 1,600cc engine _ and GM's researchers\nestimate its thermal efficiency at somewhere between 53 percent and\n67 percent.\n\n\n   In other words, up to two-thirds of the energy in HydroGen1's\nfuel is ultimately channelled to the vehicle's wheels. That is\nnearly four times more than the best gas-engined vehicles.\n\n\n   The car maker claims to have achieved several other significant\nbreakthroughs with HydroGen1.\n\n\n   It can operate at temperatures as cold as -40degreesC. Even in\nsuch conditions, it takes less than 30 seconds to boost itself into\noperation, compared with five minutes or more for existing fuel\ncells.\n\n\n   But it is its compactness that really makes it look a plausible\npredecessor to a production version.\n\n\n   The fuel cell and hydrogen-storage system in the previous\nprototype took up not only the engine compartment of an Opel\nZafira, but the vehicle's trunk and half the rear seat as well.\n\n\n   HydroGen1 squeezes most of its hardware under the hood, while\nraising the floor of the trunk by a modest 10cm (2.5 inches) and\nthe rear seat by 4cm.

Environmentalists like it, because its\nexhaust is water. And, after some initial hesitation, the world's\ncar makers are now investing heavily in turning it into a practical\nreality.\n\n\n   The latest prototype comes from General Motors. The archly named\nHydroGen1 is a third of the size of the company's previous version,\nyet it produces about 60 percent more power _ 80 kilowatts, the\nequivalent of an average 1,600cc engine _ and GM's researchers\nestimate its thermal efficiency at somewhere between 53 percent and\n67 percent.\n\n\n   In other words, up to two-thirds of the energy in HydroGen1's\nfuel is ultimately channelled to the vehicle's wheels. That is\nnearly four times more than the best gas-engined vehicles.\n\n\n   The car maker claims to have achieved several other significant\nbreakthroughs with HydroGen1.\n\n\n   It can operate at temperatures as cold as -40degreesC. Even in\nsuch conditions, it takes less than 30 seconds to boost itself into\noperation, compared with five minutes or more for existing fuel\ncells.\n\n\n   But it is its compactness that really makes it look a plausible\npredecessor to a production version.\n\n\n   The fuel cell and hydrogen-storage system in the previous\nprototype took up not only the engine compartment of an Opel\nZafira, but the vehicle's trunk and half the rear seat as well.\n\n\n   HydroGen1 squeezes most of its hardware under the hood, while\nraising the floor of the trunk by a modest 10cm (2.5 inches) and\nthe rear seat by 4cm.

Kral of the University of Arkansas,  \n``grows just fine and dandy'' in a simulated Martian environment \nthat would kill most every other forms of Earth life. \n\n\n\tKral, who is reporting on his research Wednesday at the national  \nmeeting of the American Society for Microbiology, said he and a \ncolleague, Curtis Bekkum, created an environment in culture dishes \nthat closely mimics the environment of Mars. \n\n\n\tThe dishes contained no oxygen, but were bathed in carbon  \ndioxide and hydrogen gases. The soil in the experiment resembles \nwhat is known about Martian dirt, with no organic nutrients and \nonly a small trace of water. \n\n\n\t``We make the assumption that there is liquid water beneath the  \nsurface,'' said Kral. Many planet experts believe that Mars once \nhad great amounts of water and traces of it still remain beneath \nthe surface. \n\n\n\tInto this mix, the researchers placed a group of microbes called  \nmethanogens, a type of bacteria that on Earth lives in places where \nthere is no oxygen. \n\n\n\tKral said the microbe comes from a family of organisms that  \nlives on Earth deep under the ground or around sea floor vents. \nSome types of methanogens even live in the stomach of cows where \nthey help digest grass. \n\n\n\tAll of these types of microbes, he said, use nitrogen and  \nhydrogen to make methane, a natural gas that can be used as fuel. \n\n\n\tTo determine if the bacteria lived in the simulated Martian  \nenvironment, Kral said he measured the amount of methane produced \ninside the sealed culture dishes. \n\n\n\t``It made methane just like it does on Earth,'' he said. ``It  \ngrows just fine in the Martian conditions. In fact, it grew fine \nand dandy.'' \n\n\n\tAlthough the experiment is far from the final answer, Kral said  \nthe fact that the microbes thrived ``cautiously increases our \nbelief that life on Mars is possible, or at least it was \npossible.'' \n\n\n\tKral said the experiment also raises the possibility that the  \nmicrobes could be used to cause a change in the planetary climate \nof Mars. \n\n\n\t``If man were to go to Mars someday and introduce life, this  \nmight be the form of life that would grow there,'' he said. ``If \nyou were going to try to create an Earthlike conditions there, \nputting this type of organism on Mars might be the thing to start \nit.'' \n\n\n\tKral said that colonies of methanogens would give off methane  \ngas that could help change the climate and temperature of Mars. The \nplanet surface now is very cold; but if methane collected in the \natmosphere, it eventually could create a greenhouse effect, he \nsaid. \n\n\n\t``Methane is a greenhouse gas, which means you could warm up the  \nplanet,'' he said. Greenhouse gases allow the sunlight to hit the \nplanet surface, but prevent the solar heat from escaping back into \nspace. \n\n\n\tMethane also could provide the energy for a human colony on  \nMars, said Kral. The gas can be used as fuel and could even be \nprocessed into a rocket propellant. \n\n\n\tNASA has been studying the idea of one day sending a  \nmethane-producing robot spacecraft to Mars, said Kral. Using \nhydrogen brought from Earth and carbon dioxide from the Martian \natmosphere, it would be possible to make and store methane, he \nsaid. The fuel then would be available when people are eventually \nsent to Mars. \n\n\n\t``They could use the methane to rocket themselves back to  \nEarth,'' he said. \n\n\n\tMethanogen microbes, in theory, also could be used on Mars to  \nmake methane and provide the energy needed for a human colony \nthere, said Kral.",

      "content": "SCIENCE NOTES AND NEWS \n\n\n\n   Bouncing Buckyball\n\n\n   To the list of remarkable properties of those single-molecule\nspheres of carbon atoms known as buckyballs can be added another:\nThey bounce.\n\n\n   Scientists at the University of California at Berkeley and the\nLawrence Berkeley National Laboratory have controlled the movement\nof a buckyball by making it the centerpiece of a tiny transistor.\n(Buckyballs consist of 60 carbon atoms and are more formally called\nbuckminsterfullerenes, in honor of the inventor of the geodesic\ndome, which has the same kind of structure.)\n\n\n   In a typical transistor, like those found by the millions on a\ncomputer chip, a voltage from a gate electrode controls the current\nthat flows between two other electrodes, known as the source and\ndrain, across a semiconducting material. In the Berkeley\ntransistor, a buckyball sits between the source and drain\nelectrodes, and the current flows one electron at a time.\n\n\n   Depending on the energy of the electron, it will either be\nreflected from the buckyball (thus, the transistor is ``off'') or\nit will hop across to the other electrode (the transistor is\n``on,'' allowing current to flow). And at certain energies, the\nresearchers report in Nature, when the electron hops across, it\nstarts the buckyball bouncing between the electrodes.\n\n\n   The researchers suggest that this coupling between the\nelectron's energy and the movement of the buckyball may have\neventual applications in very precise control of electron flow in\nmolecular-scale devices. In the meantime, bouncing buckyballs may\nbe a curiosity, but perhaps not a surprising one. After all, a\nbuckyball's structure of 12 pentagons and 20 hexagons is just like\nthat of a classic soccer ball.\n\n\n   Tiniest Fullerene\n\n\n   A sphere of 60 carbon atoms is not the smallest fullerene\npossible. That distinction belongs to one made up of 20 atoms\narranged in 12 pentagons, with no hexagons. (Those who paid\nattention in school know that this structure is called a\ndodecahedron.)\n\n\n   The problem with this fullerene was that no one had ever seen\nit. There were even doubts that it could exist, given the strain\ncaused by the high degree of curvature of such a sphere.\n\n\n   Those doubts have now disappeared, thanks to work by chemists in\nGermany and the United States, who report in Nature that they have\nproduced the smallest fullerene, although only in its gas phase and\nonly fleetingly.\n\n\n   The researchers made the molecule using dodecahedrane, which has\nthe right 20-carbon structure as its core but comes with hydrogen\natoms attached. By gently stripping off the hydrogen atoms in a\ntwo-step process, they were able to produce the fullerene.\n\n\n   El Nino's Child: Cholera\n\n\n   El Nino has been blamed for a many things, from destruction of\nmillion-dollar hillside homes in California to shrinking marine\niguanas on the Galapagos Islands.\n\n\n   Now, researchers from Cornell and the universities of Maryland,\nBarcelona and London have come up with a new reason to curse El\nNino: They have linked it to cholera outbreaks in Bangladesh.\n\n\n   Using mathematical models and data on cholera cases collected\nover 18 years at a hospital in Dhaka, Bangladesh, the researchers\nanalyzed the role of climate and previous levels of the disease on\noutbreak patterns. They found that cholera reached a peak every 3.7\nyears over the 18-year period, the same frequency as El Nino\nevents, in which warming waters in the eastern Pacific disrupt\nweather patterns worldwide.\n\n\n   Cholera is caused by a bacterium that thrives in plankton in\nbrackish water and in estuaries. The researchers, in a report in\nScience, suggest that warming of these waters caused by El\nNino-related atmospheric changes increases bacteria levels and the\nrisks of human contamination. They note there is an 11-month lag\nbetween an El Nino and a rise in cholera cases, which makes sense\ngiven that it takes time for the ocean warming in the eastern\nPacific to bring about climate changes in South Asia.",

They like the way fuel cells can produce\nelectricity in a clean, contained process that doesn't generate air\npollution the way coal-fired plants do, and that is also more\nefficient in generating power.\n\n\n   ``We are very interested in promoting this technology not only\nto consumers, but to municipalities around the state,'' said Daniel\nR. Mackay, representative of the New York Conservation Education\nFund.\n\n\n   The idea behind fuel-cell technology is to take a common fuel,\nsuch as natural gas or propane and convert that into hydrogen gas.\nEarly models are starting with hydrogen gas.\n\n\n   Hydrogen molecules are actually split into electrons and\nprotons, with the electrons providing the power that can be\nconverted into electricity for the home. The protons left over\nreact with oxygen in the air and create water, which is emitted\nfrom the fuel cell as exhaust. Thin membranes are used as a sort of\nstaging for the whole process.\n\n\n   ``It never stops to boggle my mind that a little Saran Wrap-type\nmaterial can give you 300 to 400 amps of power, and your average\ntoaster uses 15 amps of power,'' said William Ernst, vice president\nand technical director of the Latham, N.Y.-based Plug Power.\n\n\n   Fuel cells are manufactured to match the specific energy needs\nof different categories of consumers. Plug Power's first product\nwill produce 7,000 watts of power, more than enough to handle the\nenergy demands of a 2,000 square-foot home, according to the\ncompany.\n\n\n   Already, a modest brick-faced ranch belonging to a company\nemployee is using a demonstration model fuel cell now.\n\n\n   Company employees admitted visitors to the home Wednesday to\nshow how computers, televisions, kitchen appliances, lights and air\nconditioners can all be powered at the same time from the fuel\ncell.\n\n\n   Because the electricity is actually produced right on the home\nsite with a delivered fuel such as natural gas or propane from a\nhome tank, it doesn't have to be transmitted through power lines\nand poles that can be felled in storms.\n\n\n   Plug Power said the power produced by a fuel cell could be 20\npercent cheaper than that provided by major utility companies.\n\n\n   In addition, heat expended by the fuel cell can be used to heat\nwater in the home.\n\n\n   Plug Power President Gary Mittleman said he expected utility\ncompanies to distribute the systems to residential customers when\nthe first product, the Plug Power 7000, comes onto the market in\n2000.\n\n\n   Utility companies may own the product, install it on customer\npremises and charge for the electricity produced, he said. As the\nmarket evolves, customers might buy their own models, perhaps even\nfrom appliance dealers.\n\n\n   Other companies also are trying to produce this technology and\nto get into related markets. Some companies, for instance, are\nfocused solely on fuel cells for cars.\n\n\n   Connecticut-based Onsi Corp. produces fuel cells for commercial\nbuildings that require more power.\n\n\n   GE Power Systems distributes power-generation units for small\nindustrial units, and so goes after a different segment of the\npower market, according to a spokeswoman.\n\n\n   So far, Plug Power is well-positioned to be the leader in the\nU.S. residential market, said Jean M. Redfield, president of DTE\nEdison Electric, which is one of Plug Power's two corporate\nparents.\n\n\n   Plug Power also has its eye on markets in China, Latin America\nand other countries where some regions lack extensive power-grid\nsystems, executives said, as well as industrialized nations that\nare grappling with air-pollution problems.\n\n\n   Plug Power is a joint vent",

The tank produces unwanted hydrogen\nas radiation fields bombard organic chemicals that were added years\nago in what officials now say was a mistaken strategy to reduce the\nwaste's volume.\n\n\n   Until six years ago, the hydrogen was emitted in huge releases\nthat official studies call burps, causing ``waste-bergs,'' chunks\nof waste floating on the surface, to roll over.\n\n\n   With the tank belching thousands of cubic feet of gas at roughly\n100-day intervals, Energy Department officials were afraid that at\nsome point it would burp during a lightning storm and cause an\nexplosion. ``Under certain conditions, you could rupture the\ntank,'' said Leo Duffy Jr., who was the Energy Department's chief\nenvironmental official during the Bush administration. ``You'd have\na challenge on your hands in the state of Washington,'' he said.\n\n\n   An explosion would spread radioactive material into the\nenvironment, experts say.\n\n\n   In retrospect, the gassy eructations were the good old days.\n\n\n   To reduce the chance of fire or explosion, the Energy Department\nordered installation of a huge pump in July 1993 to break the\nhydrogen into tiny bubbles, which engineers hoped would then rise\nto the surface like carbon dioxide fizzing out of a soft drink.\n\n\n   For a time that worked. But engineers theorize that the crust\nstarted to toughen because it no longer rolled over from time to\ntime, and it prevented the hydrogen from coming to the surface. In\nDecember 1997, the crust began to rise, even though virtually\nnothing was being added to the tank.\n\n\n   The waste's surface climbed from about 403 inches above the\nbottom of the tank to 435 inches at its peak, before workers lanced\nit, with each inch representing almost 3,000 gallons. That level\nwas 13 inches above the maximum specified for the tank's operation.\nBy Friday, the waste had risen again to 432 inches. The tank is\nprotected by a double shell, but the waste is within 2 feet of the\nlevel at which the outer shell ends.\n\n\n   ``We were getting awfully close, closer than we wanted to be,''\nsaid Dr. Carolyn Huntoon, assistant secretary of energy for\nenvironmental management.\n\n\n   The crust also grew downward, and could eventually threaten the\nintake nozzle of the mixer pump. Experts say that if it clogged the\npump, the hydrogen would begin accumulating at the bottom again and\nburping to the surface, but the crust that would then roll over\nwould be four times bigger than it was before the pump was\ninstalled. And the vapor space at the top of the tank would be far\nsmaller, making it easier to reach a hydrogen concentration that\nwould support a fire or explosion.\n\n\n   ``The roll",

      "content": "NUCLEAR SITE IS BATTLING A RISING TIDE OF WASTE \n\n\n\n   WASHINGTON _ A giant radioactive souffle is rising toward the\ntop of a million-gallon tank of nuclear waste buried in the desert\nnear Richland, Wash.\n\n\n   Whipped up unexpectedly by a pump that was supposed to dissipate\npockets of hydrogen gas, the waste has smothered one tube for vapor\nsampling, threatens other instruments and could eventually\noverflow, according to officials of the Department of Energy and\nthe contractor in charge of the tank, Lockheed Martin Hanford Corp.\nThey are rushing to pump some of the waste into another tank,\npossibly within a month.\n\n\n   In May, workers stopped the growth, at least temporarily, by\nlancing the crust with high-pressure water jets, but the hole they\nmade is beginning to close.\n\n\n   ``I don't make any claims about this tank,'' said Donald Oakley,\na retired environmental expert from Los Alamos National Laboratory,\nhired by the Energy Department as an outside consultant. ``I'm not\nconvinced anyone understands the chemistry and physics involved in\nthis crust.''\n\n\n   At the Washington State Department of Ecology, Mike Wilson,\nmanager of the nuclear waste program, said that before the crust\nwas lanced, engineers were predicting the waste would reach the top\nof the tank this fall. ``It was `The Blob' kind of thing,'' he\nsaid.\n\n\n   The 20-year-old tank, called SY-101, is buried just under the\nsurface at the Hanford nuclear reservation, 20 miles from Richland,\na city of about 32,000 people. The tank produces unwanted hydrogen\nas radiation fields bombard organic chemicals that were added years\nago in what officials now say was a mistaken strategy to reduce the\nwaste's volume.\n\n\n   Until six years ago, the hydrogen was emitted in huge releases\nthat official studies call burps, causing ``waste-bergs,'' chunks\nof waste floating on the surface, to roll over.\n\n\n   With the tank belching thousands of cubic feet of gas at roughly\n100-day intervals, Energy Department officials were afraid that at\nsome point it would burp during a lightning storm and cause an\nexplosion. ``Under certain conditions, you could rupture the\ntank,'' said Leo Duffy Jr., who was the Energy Department's chief\nenvironmental official during the Bush administration. ``You'd have\na challenge on your hands in the state of Washington,'' he said.\n\n\n   An explosion would spread radioactive material into the\nenvironment, experts say.\n\n\n   In retrospect, the gassy eructations were the good old days.\n\n\n   To reduce the chance of fire or explosion, the Energy Department\nordered installation of a huge pump in July 1993 to break the\nhydrogen into tiny bubbles, which engineers hoped would then rise\nto the surface like carbon dioxide fizzing out of a soft drink.\n\n\n   For a time that worked. But engineers theorize that the crust\nstarted to toughen because it no longer rolled over from time to\ntime, and it prevented the hydrogen from coming to the surface. In\nDecember 1997, the crust began to rise, even though virtually\nnothing was being added to the tank.\n\n\n   The waste's surface climbed from about 403 inches above the\nbottom of the tank to 435 inches at its peak, before workers lanced\nit, with each inch representing almost 3,000 gallons. That level\nwas 13 inches above the maximum specified for the tank's operation.\nBy Friday, the waste had risen again to 432 inches. The tank is\nprotected by a double shell, but the waste is within 2 feet of the\nlevel at which the outer shell ends.\n\n\n   ``We were getting awfully close, closer than we wanted to be,''\nsaid Dr. Carolyn Huntoon, assistant secretary of energy for\nenvironmental management.\n\n\n   The crust also grew downward, and could eventually threaten the\nintake nozzle of the mixer pump. Experts say that if it clogged the\npump, the hydrogen would begin accumulating at the bottom again and\nburping to the surface, but the crust that would then roll over\nwould be four times bigger than it was before the pump was\ninstalled. And the vapor space at the top of the tank would be far\nsmaller, making it easier to reach a hydrogen concentration that",

      "content": "FIRM'S `SNIFFER' UNITS FRAGRANT WITH POTENTIAL\n\n\n\n   LOS ANGELES -- Five years ago, over frankfurters and beer at a\nhot dog stand, aerospace consultants David Haberman and David\nWalker decided to take a chance.\n\n\n   The pair had learned of a technology developed at Sandia\nNational Laboratory in New Mexico and available for\ncommercialization that used an air-sniffing computer chip to detect\nhydrogen gas. Believing hydrogen would play a growing role in\nindustry, and that existing sensors were too expensive and bulky to\nkeep pace, Walker and Haberman created DCH Technology Inc. to bring\nthe technology to market.\n\n\n   The rest, as they say, is history.\n\n\n   Well, not quite. After five years, the Valencia-based company's\nthree standard-bearer products are starting to gain acceptance. But\nso far, DCH has generated little in the way of sales, with 1998\nrevenues of $215,000 and a net loss of more than $4 million. The\ncompany's stock, which peaked as high $8.25 following its initial\npublic offering in 1996, closed Friday at $1.\n\n\n   Still, Walker and Haberman say they are confident of the firm's\nprospects. ``We have no debt, the founders remain in control of the\ncompany and our products are quite good,'' said Haberman, DCH's\nchairman and vice president of planning.\n\n\n   At least a few others agree. James Stock's Stock Tips, a Las\nVegas-based investor newsletter, declared the company was ``farther\nalong than they've ever been to meeting their corporate goals'' and\nsaid it may be one of the market's best-kept secrets.\n\n\n   At the heart of the DCH game plan is the sensor chip itself.\nDeveloped at Sandia, a U.S. Department of Energy research lab, it\nconsists of a thin layer of palladium nickel alloy sandwiched on\ntop of an integrated circuit. When it comes into contact with\nhydrogen atoms, even at minute levels, the alloy spits protons\ndirectly into the integrated circuit's logic cells.\n\n\n   Using that same basic technology, DCH has developed a hand-held\ndevice for hunting down leaks, a model for installation on\nhydrogen-powered devices, and a version for use in permanent\nlocales where hydrogen might seep out, such as at a nuclear power\nplant or waste-treatment center. Together, the three applications\nhave a potential market of $200 million, the company estimates.\n\n\n   By outsourcing the manufacturing of the sensors to industrial\ngiant Allied Signal, DCH has managed to keep its staff and capital\ninvestments down. The company's staff of 11 consists primarily of\nengineers working to refine the sensor and develop new\napplications.\n\n\n   Haberman and Walker, meanwhile, have been working to\nestablishing relationships with a bevy of blue chip names they hope\nwill result in 1999 sales of between $3 million and $4 million. A\nDCH sensor flew aboard a NASA space shuttle mission last year to\ntest the device's extraterrestrial applications. Westinghouse\nrecently certified the technology for use at a Russian nuclear\npower plant it is retrofitting. And Northrup Grumman Corp. is using\nDCH products in its metallurgy division. Other customers include\nFord Motor Co., Lockheed Martin Defense Systems and the U.S. Naval\nMedical Research Institute.\n\n\n   Still, the fact remains that demand for hydrogen sensors of any\nsort is limited. While the element is a key ingredient in the fuel\ncells that environmentalists believe will one day power cars,\nhydrogen sensor sales currently total in the thousands worldwide,\nnot millions. But if just two or three companies opted to include\nDCH devices on a broad basis -- say, in every fuel-cell car Ford\nproduces -- it would mean a windfall for the company, Haberman\nsaid.\n\n\n   With increased sniffing of DCH by investors and customers alike,\nHaberman said things look positive. ``We've been distinctly poor at\ncommunications . . . but the neat part is the phone keeps ringing''\nfrom potential customers, he said. ``It just seems like\neverything's clicking and coming together.''\n\n\n   X X X",

The discovery will also compel scientists to revise a\nhighly successful theory of the composition of matter known as the\nStandard Model.\n\n\n   Word of the discovery had drawn some 300 physicists here to\ndiscuss neutrino research. Among other things, they said, the\nfinding of neutrino mass might affect theories about the formation\nand evolution of galaxies and the ultimate fate of the universe. If\nneutrinos have sufficient mass, their presence throughout the\nuniverse would increase the overall mass of the universe, possibly\nslowing its present expansion.\n\n\n   Others said the newly detected but as yet unmeasured mass of the\nneutrino must be too small to cause cosmological effects. But\nwhatever the case, there was general agreement here that the\ndiscovery will have far-reaching consequences for the investigation\nof the nature of matter.\n\n\n   Speaking for the collaboration of scientists who discovered the\nexistence of neutrino mass using a huge underground detector called\nSuper-Kamiokande, Dr. Takaaki Kajita of the Institute for Cosmic\nRay Research of Tokyo University said that all explanations for the\ndata collected by the detector except the existence of neutrino\nmass had been essentially ruled out.\n\n\n   Dr. Yoji Totsuka, leader of the coalition and director of the\nKamioka Neutrino Observatory where the underground detector is\nsituated, 30 miles north of here in the Japan Alps, acknowledged\nthat his group's announcement was ``very strong,'' but said, ``We\nhave investigated all other possible causes of the effects we have\nmeasured and only neutrino mass remains.''\n\n\n   Dr. John Bahcall, a leading neutrino expert and astrophysical\ntheorist at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J.,\nsaid in an interview that there had been many claims in recent\nyears of the discovery of neutrino mass by other groups. ``But this\none is by far the most convincing,'' he said. ``Besides the strong\nevidence they have found, this team has a magnificent track record\nof discoveries.''\n\n\n   But because the elusive particles cannot be seen, the evidence\nthat they have mass is indirect.\n\n\n   Under the Standard Model of matter, neutrinos come in three\ntypes or ``flavors.'' The data gathered by the Super-Kamiokande\nteam during the two years the detector has operated indicate that\nat least one of these three ``flavors'' can ``oscillate'' into one\nof the other flavors as it travels along at nearly the speed of\nlight. According to the theories of quantum mechanics, any particle\ncapable of transforming itself in this way must have mass.\n\n\n   Study of the neutrino particle has been glacially slow since its\nexistence was hypothesized in 1931 by the Austrian physicist\nWolfgang Pauli as a way to explain the mysterious loss of energy in\ncertain nuclear reactions. The particle was finally discovered in\n1956 by two physicists at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, Dr.\nFrederick Reines (who was awarded a Nobel Prize for the discovery)\nand the late Dr. Clyde Cowan.\n\n\n   But understanding of the particle since then has been acquired\npainfully slowly, because neutrinos have no electric charge and\nrarely interact with any kind of matter. A neutrino so rarely\ncollides with an atom of ordinary matter that a typical neutrino\ncan easily penetrate a one-light-year thickness of lead _ some six\ntrillion miles _ without hindrance.\n\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)\n\n\n   As the writer John Updike put it in a poem he wrote in 1960:\n\n\n   ``Neutrin",

      "content": "SCIENCE JOURNALS PUBLISHES 53 MOST IMPORTANT PAPERS OF THE 20TH\nCENTURY \n\n\n\n   ``It is somewhat depressing, at age 91, to reread the work of 36\nyears ago, when the juices in a brain, now made largely of\novercooked brussels sprouts, were flowing more rapidly.''\n\n\n   So begins Dr. Jesse L. Greenstein's remembrance of a paper he\nhad first published in the July 1, 1964, issue of The Astrophysical\nJournal concerning the likely energy source of the distant,\nshockingly luminous objects called quasars.\n\n\n   The paper and remembrance appear in a new, 1,283-page compendium\nof what have been judged the 53 most important papers to appear in\nThe Astrophysical Journal and The Astronomical Journal in the 20th\ncentury.\n\n\n   Affectionately known as Ap.J. and A.J., the journals are the\nmost respected and important in astronomy. They have chronicled\nastronomy's journey from the turn-of-the-century debate over\nwhether the Milky Way made up the entire cosmos to the present view\nthat Earth's galaxy is one obscure smudge of stars and gas hurtling\napart from billions of others in the wake of the Big Bang.\n\n\n   With each paper there is an accompanying article placing the\noriginal contribution in context and bringing its implications up\nto date. Some of the accompaniments are by original authors, some\nby astronomers of more recent vintage.\n\n\n   Dr. Jeremiah P. Ostriker of Princeton, for example, comments on\nan October 1937 paper by Dr. Fritz Zwicky of the California\nInstitute of Technology that provided the first evidence that the\nuniverse might be full of a strange kind of ``dark matter'' _ a\nmysterious substance that still baffles astronomers.\n\n\n   That date, notes Ostriker in his comment, meant the original\npaper was published ``six months after my own birth, and so, no\ndoubt, conceived before I was.''\n\n\n   The century's best were chosen by a panel of astronomers led by\nDr. Donald E. Osterbrock of the University of California in Santa\nCruz. Behind the exercise was more than a desire to hand out blue\nribbons, according to Dr. Helmut A. Abt, who stepped down as editor\nin chief of Ap.J. last year, after nearly 30 years in the job.\n\n\n   ``Some people are tempted to think that most of the important\nresults were derived in the past decade or two,'' Abt wrote in the\nintroduction to the volume. But, he went on with a veteran's\nmeasured ire, ``it is sometimes surprising to discover how many\nbasic results were obtained many years ago.''\n\n\n   One early debate involved the size of the universe. Astronomers\nknew that a crucial clue lay in the nature of what they called the\nspiral nebula, of which a prominent example was an object called\nMessier 31 in the constellation Andromeda. Were they wisps of gas\nand dust in the cozy confines of the Milky Way or ``island\nuniverses,'' meaning whole galaxies themselves, lying far away?\n\n\n   In 1925, the astronomer Edwin Hubble set that question to rest\nin a paper in Ap.J. titled ``A Spiral Nebula as a Stellar System,\nMessier 31.'' Based on about 350 photographs taken with the\n100-inch and 60-inch reflecting telescopes at Mount Wilson in\nCalifornia, the largest telescopes of the day, the paper showed\nthat the nebula's spiral arms contained swarms of faint stars,\nincluding variable stars and novas, and that it was much too\ndistant to be contained in the Milky Way.\n\n\n   ``This paper clearly ended all doubts that the spiral galaxies\nwere extragalactic,'' wrote Dr. Arthur D. Code of the University of\nWisconsin in a commentary. The finding also made it easier to\nswallow Hubble's next big discovery, in 1929, that all those other\ngalaxies are rushing apart from one another _ the hallmark of the\nBig Bang that most astronomers now believe gave birth to the\nuniverse.\n\n\n   A whole series of papers explored starlight: how the energy of\nnuclear fusion reactions fuels the brilliance of stars and builds\nup heavier and heavier elements from the hydrogen, helium and other\nsmall change left over from the Big Bang.\n\n\n   When these stars explode as novas and supernovas, they spread\nthose elements through the cosmos.

The goal: to find living microbes living\ndeep in the Earth.\n\n\n   Within moments the air becomes oppressively hot. This is one of\nthe farthest-reaching excavations in the world, burrowing more than\ntwo miles toward the center of Earth.\n\n\n   At the bottom of the mine, radioactivity and heat from the\nplanet's core raise the temperature of the stone in the tunnels to\na searing 120 F, and the atmospheric pressure is double that on the\nsurface.\n\n\n   Oxygen rarely exists naturally so far underground, and only a\nconstant rush of forced air from the surface disperses poisonous\nmethane and hydrogen seeping from the rock. Pumped-in jets of water\nhelp keep workers from slowly cooking to death.\n\n\n   Geologist T.C. Onstott, a Princeton professor, pulls a water\nbottle from his knapsack and takes a swig. To him, the heat and\nclaustrophobia are merely aggravation. Real worry for the team of\nscientists, as well as the miners, centers on ``seismic events'' _\nhigh-pressure cave-ins that kill.\n\n\n   It is difficult to obtain samples from wells that have not been\ncontaminated by air or water from the surface. Onstott decided he\nhad to find a way to visit the microbes himself. The mine he chose\nto explore is part of a sprawling manmade underworld started on a\nSunday morning in 1886 when an Australian prospector found a\ngold-rich outcrop on the present site of Johannesburg.\n\n\n   Like a nose peeping out of the covers, that outcrop was just the\nstart. Since then, three-quarters of the gold ever mined has come\nout of the region. The most recent shaft at East Driefontein took\n15 years to excavate _ and that was just the vertical hole.\n\n\n   For his journey into this biosphere, Onstott rounded up an\nall-star crew of microbiologists. They included: Bill Ghiorse, who\nled Environmental Protection Agency research into subsurface\nbacteria that eat toxic waste; Duane Moser, a lab wizard and avid\nspelunker; Svetlana Kotelnikova, a Russian scientist working in\nSweden; Mary DeFlaun of Envirogen, an environmental technology\nfirm; and Jim Fredrickson, who has isolated many deep-bacteria\ncultures while working at the Pacific Northwest National\nLaboratory.\n\n\n   At East Driefontein, Onstott and his team would spend three\nmonths gathering samples at a depth where no microbe hunters had\nventured before: The No. 5 Shaft bottoms out at 11,222 feet.\n\n\n   On this scouting mission, the elevator slowly comes to a halt at\n6,120 feet and the researchers walk through a short tunnel to a\nsecond elevator that takes them to the mine's deepest diggings. At\nthe bottom, the group boards a miniature train for a half-mile ride\nthrough the dark as a giant air pipe roars overhead.\n\n\n   The train stops at a dark hole in the wall: the stope, or mining\nface. The passage dips down at a steep angle; in many sections the\nceiling is only three feet high.\n\n\n   The stope swarms with miners. Drills, saws and jackhammers roar\nso loudly that hand signals must be used. Amid the pandemonium, the\nscientists find their objective: a black coal-like vein interwoven\nwith round stones and sparkly filaments.\n\n\n   This mineral-rich seam is dubbed the carbon leader. Often no\nmore than a finger wide, sandwiched in a mass of ancient quartzite,\nthe carbon leader is heavily laced with uranium and holds an\nextraordinary concentration of gold.\n\n\n   No one is certain how the carbon leader formed. It could be the\nremains of either algae that settled on an ancient sea bottom or\noil that shot through a crack underground. In any case, the rock\nformation is loaded with carbon compounds potentially nutritious to\nmicrobes.\n\n\n   Strong evidence that microbes could survive in an even more",

KENDALL, 72, DIES; HUNTED DOWN QUARK \n\n\n\n   Dr. Henry Way Kendall, one of three physicists who shared a\nNobel Prize for confirming that tiny particles called quarks were\nthe basic building blocks of matter, died on Monday while on an\nunderwater photography shoot in Wakulla Springs State Park, south\nof Tallahassee, Fla. He was 72 and lived in Sharon, Mass.\n\n\n   The local authorities reported that Kendall, an experienced\ndiver and underwater photographer, had joined a team from National\nGeographic magazine but was working by himself before his body was\nfound a few feet from shore. An autopsy was being performed.\n\n\n   Kendall was also known for his work with the Union of Concerned\nScientists, an advocacy group that he helped found in 1969 and led\nas chairman since 1973.\n\n\n   Kendall and his colleagues won the 1990 Nobel Prize in Physics\nfor experiments that confirmed the existence of quarks, the\ninfinitesimally tiny packets of energy that make up protons and\nneutrons, which were once thought to be matter's fundamental\nparticles. Dr. Richard E. Taylor, a Canadian professor at Stanford\nUniversity, and Dr. Jerome I. Friedman, a fellow scientist at the\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology, were recognized with\nKendall.\n\n\n   Their work from 1967 to 1973 validated what had been\nhypothesized independently in the early 1960s by Dr. Murray\nGel-Mann and Dr. George Zweig at the California Institute of\nTechnology. Gell-Mann named these elusive particles ``quarks'' on a\nwhim, borrowing the word from James Joyce's ``Finnegan's Wake.''\n\n\n   Kendall, Taylor and Friedman, who first met as graduate students\nat Stanford, conducted their research at the Stanford Linear\nAccelerator Center using a two-mile-long particle accelerator able\nto boost beams of electrons to an energy of 22 billion\nelectron-volts. They directed the beams at targets containing\nliquid hydrogen.\n\n\n   The purpose was to achieve a special kind of collision that\noccurs when electrons hit protons (which constitute the nuclei of\nhydrogen) at certain energies. Initial results were ambiguous. But\nas the three fine-tuned their instruments, the results clearly\nshowed that both protons and neutrons contained hard, electrically\ncharged, point-like particles corresponding to the quarks foretold\nin theory.\n\n\n   That confirmation allowed physicists to proceed confidently with\ndeveloping what is known as the standard model theory of matter.\nThe Nobel Prize panel applauded their feat as a ``breakthrough in\nour understanding of matter.''\n\n\n   In his role with the Union of Concerned Scientists, Kendall\nopposed President Ronald Reagan's ``Star Wars'' anti-missile\nproject, and he challenged the concept that such a system could\ndefend American cities from nuclear attack.\n\n\n   Kendall consistently warned of the dangers of nuclear weapons,\nspace-based arsenals and radiation leaks from nuclear power\ngenerators. His organization also studied the greenhouse effect, a\nwarming of the earth's climate as a result of emissions of\nheat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide. Kendall helped to brief\nPresident Clinton on the subject.\n\n\n   Kendall, who was born in Boston, graduated from Amherst College\nin 1950 and received a Ph.D. in nuclear physics from the\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology in 1955. He was a National\nScience Foundation Fellow at MIT at the time. He lectured at\nStanford before joining the MIT faculty in 1961, rose to full\nprofessor in 1967 and was named as the J.A. Stratton Professor of\nPhysics in 1991.\n\n\n   His research interests covered nucleon structure, high-energy\nelectron scattering, and meson and neutrino physics. He was a\nfellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science\nand the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the recipient of\nthe 1981 Leo Szilard Award of the American Physical Society and a\n1982 Bertrand Russell Society Award.\n\n\n   Kendall is survived by a brother, John, also of Sharon.",

Stars are being born as well as dying, said Dr. Nolan\nWalborn, an astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute in\nBaltimore, but the rate varies greatly from galaxy to galaxy.\n\n\n   One mission of the Hubble Space Telescope is to observe\nstar-formation regions, he said.\n\n\n   Stars form from huge clouds of dust and gas. If a cloud begins\nto contract because of its own gravity, its interior heats up as\ngravitational energy is converted to heat energy, reaching millions\nof degrees, and nuclear reactions begin that change one element\ninto another, releasing energy.\n\n\n   The pressure tends to expand the cloud back out, Walborn said,\nbut eventually equilibrium is reached. ``That is what a star is,''\nhe said, ``a mass of gas at equilibrium between gravity's inward\npressure and outward pressure from nuclear reactions.''\n\n\n   A star has a finite lifetime because it is burning fuel. For 90\npercent of its life, it burns hydrogen into helium. When the\nhydrogen is used up, the pressure decreases, but gravity never\ndisappears, so the star contracts until the temperature climbs\nagain, this time reaching hundreds of millions of degrees, while\nreactions convert helium to carbon and oxygen. The star can then\nremain stable for a briefer time. Eventually the star dies, when\nthe reactions only consume energy but do not produce it.\n\n\n   &QL;",

      "content": "MOBILE FOAM  \n (FOR RELEASE THE WEEK OF JULY 17, 2000)\n\n\n\n   For years, polystyrene foam has been keeping our coffee hot and\nour beer cold. Now chemists have taught single molecules of this\nplastic a more impressive trick _ how to snatch and store energy\nfrom light in the way that plants do.\n\n\n   The researchers, based as the Los Alamos National Laboratory in\nNew Mexico, are aiming to build a new breed of cheap\npolystyrene-based batteries. They say the batteries could be used\nto provide power for anything from cars to cellphones.\n\n\n   The project is part of continuing efforts by Tom Meyer and his\ncolleagues at Los Alamos to find simple materials that can mimic\nthe complex chemistry of photosynthesis, which allows plants to\nstore energy from sunlight in chemical bonds.\n\n\n   The first step in photosynthesis is the absorption of a photon-a\nparticle of light-by an antenna composed of the green pigment\nchlorophyll. This energy is then used to propel electrons around\nthe chemical bonds of the molecules involved in the reaction,\nultimately stripping electrons from water to make oxygen, and\nadding them to carbon dioxide to create energy-rich sugars.\n\n\n   Meyer's team had already managed to recreate each of these steps\nseparately, using different synthetic molecules that work in\nconjunction with an atom of the metal ruthenium. In his latest\nexperiments, he decided to link these molecules on a polymer\nbackbone.\n\n\n   ``Because polystyrene polymers are so widely used, their\nchemistry is very well understood,'' he says. ``So it was an\nobvious choice for the backbone.''\n\n\n   To test out the new molecule, the researchers zapped a solution\nof it with a laser. As they had hoped, some side chains containing\nthe ruthenium antennas were able to absorb the light energy and\npass it along the polymer chain. When the energy reached another\ntype of ruthenium complex, it was able to do some chemical work,\npushing an electron to a different part of the complex. Mobilizing\nelectrons in this way is what batteries do-supplying electrons from\nan anode that can be drawn around a circuit and back towards its\ncathode.\n\n\n   Michael Wasielewski, a photosynthetic chemist at Northwestern\nUniversity in Chicago, thinks Meyer's choice of polymer was the\nkey.\n\n\n   ``All the right properties are there,'' he says. ``And we\nalready have robust manufacturing technology to work with\npolystyrene. It's a nice piece of work.''\n\n\n   Because polystyrene derivatives are inexpensive to create, Meyer\nthinks his polymer holds great promise for a wide array of devices\n_ such as solar-powered fuel cells that pull electrons from water\nto create hydrogen fuel or to generate an electric current.\n\n\n   For now, his team's main aim is to increase the efficiency with\nwhich the molecules convert energy, which is now hovering around 15\npercent.\n\n\n   ``There's a lot of hard work ahead, but you have to expect\nthat,'' he says. ``After all, it took natural photosynthesis more\nthan a billion years to evolve.'' &QL; \n &UR; (This article is excerpted from New Scientist, a weekly science and\ntechnology magazine based in London.) &LR;  &QC;",

The goal: to find living microbes living\ndeep in the Earth.\n\n\n   Within moments the air becomes oppressively hot. This is one of\nthe farthest-reaching excavations in the world, burrowing more than\ntwo miles toward the center of Earth.\n\n\n   At the bottom of the mine, radioactivity and heat from the\nplanet's core raise the temperature of the stone in the tunnels to\na searing 120 F, and the atmospheric pressure is double that on the\nsurface.\n\n\n   Oxygen rarely exists naturally so far underground, and only a\nconstant rush of forced air from the surface disperses poisonous\nmethane and hydrogen seeping from the rock. Pumped-in jets of water\nhelp keep workers from slowly cooking to death.\n\n\n   Geologist T.C. Onstott, a Princeton professor, pulls a water\nbottle from his knapsack and takes a swig. To him, the heat and\nclaustrophobia are merely aggravation. Real worry for the team of\nscientists, as well as the miners, centers on ``seismic events'' _\nhigh-pressure cave-ins that kill.\n\n\n   It is difficult to obtain samples from wells that have not been\ncontaminated by air or water from the surface. Onstott decided he\nhad to find a way to visit the microbes himself. The mine he chose\nto explore is part of a sprawling manmade underworld started on a\nSunday morning in 1886 when an Australian prospector found a\ngold-rich outcrop on the present site of Johannesburg.\n\n\n   Like a nose peeping out of the covers, that outcrop was just the\nstart. Since then, three-quarters of the gold ever mined has come\nout of the region. The most recent shaft at East Driefontein took\n15 years to excavate _ and that was just the vertical hole.\n\n\n   For his journey into this biosphere, Onstott rounded up an\nall-star crew of microbiologists. They included: Bill Ghiorse, who\nled Environmental Protection Agency research into subsurface\nbacteria that eat toxic waste; Duane Moser, a lab wizard and avid\nspelunker; Svetlana Kotelnikova, a Russian scientist working in\nSweden; Mary DeFlaun of Envirogen, an environmental technology\nfirm; and Jim Fredrickson, who has isolated many deep-bacteria\ncultures while working at the Pacific Northwest National\nLaboratory.\n\n\n   At East Driefontein, Onstott and his team would spend three\nmonths gathering samples at a depth where no microbe hunters had\nventured before: The No. 5 Shaft bottoms out at 11,222 feet.\n\n\n   On this scouting mission, the elevator slowly comes to a halt at\n6,120 feet and the researchers walk through a short tunnel to a\nsecond elevator that takes them to the mine's deepest diggings. At\nthe bottom, the group boards a miniature train for a half-mile ride\nthrough the dark as a giant air pipe roars overhead.\n\n\n   The train stops at a dark hole in the wall: the stope, or mining\nface. The passage dips down at a steep angle; in many sections the\nceiling is only three feet high.\n\n\n   The stope swarms with miners. Drills, saws and jackhammers roar\nso loudly that hand signals must be used. Amid the pandemonium, the\nscientists find their objective: a black coal-like vein interwoven\nwith round stones and sparkly filaments.\n\n\n   This mineral-rich seam is dubbed the carbon leader. Often no\nmore than a finger wide, sandwiched in a mass of ancient quartzite,\nthe carbon leader is heavily laced with uranium and holds an\nextraordinary concentration of gold.\n\n\n   No one is certain how the carbon leader formed. It could be the\nremains of either algae that settled on an ancient sea bottom or\noil that shot through a crack underground. In any case, the rock\nformation is loaded with carbon compounds potentially nutritious to\nmicrobes.\n\n\n   Strong evidence that microbes could survive in an even more",

Eddies of atmospheric turbulence\nbob along the margins of jet streams, feeding energy into titanic,\nlong-lived whirlpools.\n\n\n   Thunderheads tower more than 30 miles above surrounding clouds,\nand new observations reveal that moist heat rising in these stormy\nupdrafts probably supplies the energy driving most Jovian weather.\n\n\n   Scientists analyzing photographs taken by the Galileo\nspacecraft, orbiting the largest planet in the solar system, have\nconcluded that this moist convection of thunderstorms on Jupiter is\nsimilar to that on Earth _ only more so _ but is generated by heat\nfrom a completely different source: from deep in the planet, not\nfrom sunlight.\n\n\n   Other scientists said the new findings, reported in the current\nissue of the journal Nature, appeared to solve the mystery of how\nJupiter gets the energy for such a constantly stormy weather\nsystem, although many questions remain unanswered.\n\n\n   A team of astronomers led by Dr. Peter J. Gierasch of Cornell\nUniversity found the most telling evidence in images, from visible\nand infrared light, of the south equatorial belt, a region west of\nJupiter's Great Red Spot, a seemingly permanent storm in the\nsouthern hemisphere.\n\n\n   Lightning was visible there before dawn. A few hours later, a\ncluster of huge Earthlike storms developed there. The scientists\nestimated that the vertical transport of heat by such storms\ncorresponded to the flux generated by the planet's internal heat\nsource.\n\n\n   ``We therefore conclude that moist convection is a dominant\nfactor in converting heat flow into kinetic energy in the Jovian\natmosphere,'' Gierasch's group wrote.\n\n\n   In another report, a group led by Dr. Andrew P. Ingersoll of the\nCalifornia Institute of Technology in Pasadena said the lightning\npreceding the storms was a critical clue indicating the presence of\nlarge amounts of water in the deep clouds. Nothing else, they\nnoted, could condense at depths of as much as 60 miles below the\nupper layer of the atmosphere.\n\n\n   ``So we can use lightning as a beacon that points to the place\nwhere there are rapidly falling raindrops and rapidly rising air\ncolumns _ a source of energy for the eddies,'' Ingersoll explained.\n``The eddies, in turn, get pulled apart by shear flow and give up\ntheir energy to these large-scale features. So ultimately, the\nGreat Red Spot gets its energy and stays alive by eating these\neddies.''\n\n\n   On Earth, violent storms like hurricanes and cyclones are fueled\nby the warm ocean. The water is heated by sunlight, which drives\nall terrestrial weather. But Jupiter is 5 times farther from the\nSun than is Earth and sunlight is only 4 percent as strong there as\non Earth, not enough to generate the observed tempests.\n\n\n   Scientists have long assumed that Jupiter's internal heat\nsomehow churns the thick atmosphere. Because of the heat reservoir\nof highly compressed hydrogen at its core, the planet generates\nnearly 70 percent more heat than it absorbs from the Sun. But how\ndid that heat rise from the depths to drive Jovian weather?\n\n\n   Moist convection had been proposed as the mechanism, said Dr.\nAlvin Seiff of the Ames Research Center in Mountain View, Calif.,\nbut there was no firm evidence until now.\n\n\n   In an accompanying journal article, Seiff said the new research\nrepresented ``a notable advance in our knowledge of Jupiter's\nweather by demonstrating that moist convection occurs and\ntransports significant amounts of energy.''\n\n\n   But he said, ``Much work remains for us to gain a broad\ndescription of Jupiter's fluid behavior.'' One remaining\nuncertainty is what circulation is like deeper below the outer\nlayers of the planet's thick clouds.",

      "content": "EARTH MAY HAVE LONG-LOST SISTERS \n\n\n\n   WASHINGTON _ Several Earth-like planets, created billions of\nyears ago during the formation of our solar system, may be\nwandering in deep space harboring conditions that could sustain\nsome form of life, according to a new theory proposed by a\nprominent planetary scientist.\n\n\n   These orphan worlds, ejected from the solar system by\ngravitational forces during its tumultuous beginnings, may have\nretained atmospheres rich in molecular hydrogen even as they were\nflung into the dark void of interstellar space, said Dr. David J.\nStevenson, a professor of planetary science at the California\nInstitute of Technology.\n\n\n   The rogue planets, instead of being cold, icy masses meandering\namong the stars as some astronomers have believed, could be warm\nbodies with dense, insulating atmospheres that trap enough volcanic\nheat to sustain water oceans and some types of simple life forms,\nhe said in an interview.\n\n\n   ``The idea of Earth-sized bodies being ejected when the solar\nsystem formed is not new,'' Stevenson said, ``But instead of being\nuninteresting frozen balls of barren matter, I am proposing that\nthey could have acquired a dense atmosphere and maintained it to\nact as an insulating blanket to sustain Earth-like temperatures in\nthe absence of sunlight.''\n\n\n   The idea that life could exist in such seemingly inhospitable\nconditions has been bolstered in recent years by the discovery of a\nvariety of unusual creatures living in lightless, sulfurous\nenvironments at the ocean floor, warmed by heat from undersea\nvents. These discoveries have fueled speculation that life might\nexist elsewhere in the universe, though possibly in forms that\nwould seem strange to ordinary humans.\n\n\n   Stevenson described his theories in the current issue of the\njournal Nature. Stevenson said that if planetary systems around\nother stars formed in similar ways, then there could be billions of\nsuch interstellar planets flung into space. If life can develop and\nbe sustained without sunlight on these planets, he wrote, ``it is\nconceivable that these are the most common sites of life in the\nuniverse.''\n\n\n   Stevenson said his idea of dark, life-sustaining planets moving\namong the stars is drawn from linking several accepted concepts of\nplanetary theory and his own calculations. ``This is just an idea,\nbut it comes together plausibly,'' he said.\n\n\n   Dr. Jack J. Lissauer, a specialist in planet formation at the\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration's Ames Research\nCenter in California, said Stevenson's idea is an ``interesting''\none that extends earlier work by numerous other scientists. ``David\nStevenson put all these parts together and has raised the\npossibility of something that is really far out, but not\nridiculous,'' he said, ``It makes some sense.''\n\n\n   Dr. Alan P. Boss, a solar system specialist at the Carnegie\nInstitution of Washington's Department of Terrestrial Magnetism,\nsaid the new theory ``is a logical extension of what people have\nproposed for a long time about the early solar system.''\n\n\n   When the solar system was formed about 4.5 billion years ago\nfrom primal gases and dust coming together, Boss said, the process\nproduced multiple cores that tried to become planets near the\norbits of Jupiter and Saturn. Some of these bodies became parts of\nthe giant planets when drawn in by their gravity, he said, while\nothers passed nearby and were flung away in a slingshot effect that\npropelled them out of the solar system.\n\n\n   This process was responsible for knocking about a trillion small\nbodies out of the infant solar system, causing them to form a giant\nsphere of debris in deep space that surrounds the sun and its\nplanets. This debris, called the Oort cloud, is believed to be the\nsource of most comets that enter the solar system.\n\n\n   ``If the Oort cloud was formed by many small bodies being\nknocked out of the solar system, it is not a great leap to imagine\nlosing a few Earth-sized bodies the same way,'' Boss said.\n\n\n   According to Stevenson, there were about a half-dozen Earth-like\nplanets in Jupite",

      "content": "Norwegian company moves ahead with clean power plant\n\n\n\t   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ The Norsk Hydro ASA concern announced plans\nFriday to build a hydrogen-burning power plant that it says will\nproduce electricity with virtually no climate-damaging emissions.\n\t   The 51-percent state-owned company notified the Norwegian Water\nResources and Energy Directorate of plans to build the plant, to be\ncalled HydroKraft, pending approval by government agencies.\n\t   The company said if it receives the proper approvals in 1999,\nconstruction of the plant would be completed during 2002 and\nproduction startup would occur in early 2003.\n\t   Earlier this year, the company announced a new technology that\nwould allow it to use clean-burning hydrogen to generate\nelectricity. The hydrogen for the plant would be extracted from\nnatural gas.\n\t   Norsk Hydro, a major petroleum producer, now says studies have\nshown the proposal to be economically viable. It also said the\nplant's carbon dioxide emissions would be 90 percent lower than\nplants using natural gas.\n\t   Norway is the world's second-largest oil exporter, and also\nproduces vast amounts of natural gas from its offshore fields.\nVirtually all of the country's electricity now comes from\nhydroelectric plants.\n\t   Under the company's plans, natural gas, air and water would be\nmixed to produce hydrogen, nitrogen and carbon dioxide.\n\t   Norsk Hydro wants to build the plant at Karmoey, an island about\n500 kilometers (300 miles) west of Oslo.",
