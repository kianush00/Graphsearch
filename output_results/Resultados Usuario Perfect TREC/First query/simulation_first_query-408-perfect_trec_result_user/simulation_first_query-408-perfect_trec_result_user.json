At 2 a.m. Wednesday, Dennis was centered about \n75 miles north of the Caicos islands. \n\n\n\tSome strengthening was forecast through Wednesday, and it was  \nexpected to become a hurricane in the next day or so, according to \nthe hurricane center. \n\n\n\t``We think Dennis will turn up the east coast and with any luck  \nwill miss everything, but it will come close enough where we'll \nworry about it,'' Jarrell said. ``In three days it can be on almost \nany of us.'' \n\n\n\tEmily had 65 mph winds, just shy of hurricane strength, but  \nthose winds slowed down to 45 mph by late Tuesday. Forecasters had \nnot even listed the storm as a depression before the tropical storm \nadvisory Tuesday afternoon. \n\n\n\tMeanwhile, far east in the Atlantic, Tropical Storm Cindy  \ncontinued moving across the open ocean. \n\n\n\tUp until this past week, there had only been one tropical storm,  \nArlene, in June. \n\n\n\tA tropical storm carries winds of 39 to 73 mph.

      "content": "HURRICANES _ FROM ARLENE TO ZELDA \n FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE \n FROM THE FORT WORTH STAR-TELEGRAM\n\n\n\n   What is a hurricane?\n\n\n   A hurricane is an intense tropical storm that has winds of 74\nmph and higher, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\n\n   These winds blow in a large spiral around a calm center, called\nthe ``eye.'' The eye is 20-30 miles wide. In the Northern\nHemisphere of the Earth, winds move counterclockwise around the\neye. In the Southern Hemisphere, winds circulate clockwise.\n\n\n   Hurricanes develop over tropical ocean waters and many remain\nthere. When a hurricane does approach land, skies begin to darken\nand winds strengthen. The hurricane begins driving water ahead of\nit in a storm surge or tidal wave that can be 20 feet at its peak.\nHurricanes can also trigger tornadoes and floods.\n\n\n   How are hurricanes named?\n\n\n   The World Meteorological Organization has chosen an alphabetical\nlist of names for tropical storms and hurricanes, and the list\nrotates every six years. That practice started in 1953. Names used\nfor storms this year are the same that were used in 1993.\n\n\n   The names of tropical storms and hurricanes used to be all\nwomen's names until 1978 and '79. Now, men's names are alternated\nwith women's.\n\n\n   Sometimes, when a hurricane is particularly destructive, the\nname is retired, which means the name can't be used for at least 10\nyears.\n\n\n   One such name was Hurricane Andrew, which struck Florida and\nLouisiana in 1992. The storm caused 54 deaths and up to $30 billion\nin damage.\n\n\n   To put that in context, the Galveston, Texas hurricane of 1900\n(before hurricanes were named) caused 6,000 deaths, the most in\nU.S. history, according to the World Almanac and Book of Facts.\n\n\n   Where and when are most hurricanes in the United States?\n\n\n   Florida has the most hurricanes in the United States, the\nNational Hurricane Center reports.\n\n\n   Other places vulnerable to hurricanes are the coasts along the\nGulf of Mexico and the North Atlantic Ocean, from Texas to Maine.\n\n\n   The hurricane season is from June 1 to Nov. 30, and peak months\nare August and September.\n\n\n   Which hurricanes and tropical storms have formed in the Atlantic\nOcean this year?\n\n\n   Arlene: This tropical storm formed on June 11 and spent its life\nat sea in the central Atlantic. Winds reached 65 mph.\n\n\n   Bret: This hurricane struck the Texas coast near Corpus Christi\nand Brownsville on Aug. 22.

Cirrus clouds blowing east of\nthe top of the system will dim the sun as far east as Georgia.\n\n\n   Scattered showers and thunderstorms will flare over the\nSouthwestern states as a nearly stationary low pressure system at\naltitudes of several thousand feet over the central Sierra Nevada\ncontinues to draw moisture northward.

      "content": "BEFORE THE STORM COMES THE CALM \n\n\n\n   SARASOTA, Fla. _ Hey, Gert, Jose and Katrina, where are you?\n\n\n   Despite predictions of a busy hurricane season, it's been a\nfizzle so far. So the question is: Were the forecasters way off?\n\n\n   Their advice: Don't start digging into the canned tuna in your\nhurricane supplies just yet.\n\n\n   ``Two words: last year,'' said hurricane forecaster Jack Beven\nof the National Hurricane Center in Miami. ``Last year this time,\nAlex, our first tropical storm, was forming. And later on we had 10\nstorms in 33 days.''\n\n\n   Colorado State University professor Bill Gray predicted at the\nstart of the June-through-November hurricane season that 1999 might\nbe a repeat of last year, which produced a bumper crop of violent\nstorms.\n\n\n   There were 14 tropical storms in 1998, 10 of which intensified\ninto hurricanes.\n\n\n   Gray and his research team said in June that conditions were\nright for 14 storms this season. If he's right _ and he often is _\nwe'll be closely watching storms named Gert, Jose, Katrina and many\nmore.\n\n\n   But so far there's only been tropical storm Arlene, which\nbypassed Bermuda in mid-June.\n\n\n   Chris Landsea, a hurricane researcher for the National Oceanic\nand Atmospheric Association and a former student of Gray's, says\nthe slow start to this year's hurricane season isn't unusual.\n\n\n   ``The historical average is one and a half tropical storms\nforming by Aug. 1, so it's pretty close to average,'' he said last\nweek.\n\n\n   He said a slow start doesn't indicate that the season will be an\ninactive one.\n\n\n   In 1984 and 1988, the first hurricane didn't form until\nSeptember. Diana and Debby were the fourth tropical storms in those\nyears, but the first ones that developed hurricane-force winds of\nat least 74 mph. Both 1984 and 1988 produced 12 tropical storms,\nfive of which became hurricanes.\n\n\n   Nine tropical storms develop in an average year, with six of\nthem becoming hurricanes.\n\n\n   ``If anything, the slow start of the storms forming in the\nsubtropics is a sign that it could be busier than usual later on,''\nLandsea said.\n\n\n   ``It would be nice if the ones that form in the subtropics were\nforming more regularly, but they're not. It's another sign that\nlater on, the Cape Verde season could be a nasty one in 1999.''\n\n\n   Storms referred to as Cape Verde storms develop near the Cape\nVerde islands off the west coast of Africa and often become the\nbiggest and fiercest storms of the hurricane season as they gain\nstrength sweeping across the Atlantic. They can scour the Caribbean\nislands, strike the United States or Mexican mainland, or curve\nharmlessly into the North Atlantic.\n\n\n   Hurricane activity peaks in mid-September. August, September and\nOctober are the three most active months, with 90 percent of all\nstorms occurring in those months, Landsea said.\n\n\n   Gray will update his forecast Friday, and the NOAA plans to\nreassess the hurricane season next Monday.\n\n\n   But Landsea said he sees no obvious reasons to scrap the\nforecast for an active season that he and Gray predicted. Beven,\nwith the National Hurricane Center, agrees that conditions still\nappear favorable for an above-normal hurricane season.\n\n\n   A key factor is La Nina, the abnormal cooling of water in\nequatorial Pacific waters. La Nina is expected to promote hurricane\ndevelopment through the remainder of the year. Another factor Gray\ntakes into account is a high-pressure ridge in the North Atlantic,\nwhich also promotes hurricane formation.\n\n\n   (The Herald-Tribune in Sarasota, Fla., is part of the New York\nTimes Regional Newspaper Group.)",

Jeb Bush on\nSaturday activated emergency response teams.\n\n\n   State officials said they expect Gordon to be a Category 1\nhurricane with winds of between 74 and 95 mph when it strikes land\nanywhere between Fort Myers and the Panhandle sometime late Sunday.\n\n\n   Rains of five inches or more are expected and coastal areas\nshould anticipate a storm surge, said Joe Myers, the state\nemergency management director.\n\n\n   The National Hurricane Center issued a tropical storm warning\nSaturday that covered a 210-mile stretch from Bonita Beach just\nsouth of Fort Myers to the Suwanee River, about 100 miles north of\nTampa.\n\n\n   Forecasters also issued a hurricane watch for a 400-mile stretch\nfrom Bonita Beach to the Panhandle town of Apalachicola. They said\nGordon could reach hurricane strength by late Saturday.\n\n\n   A tropical storm warning means a storm with winds of between 39\nand 73 mph is expected to hit an area within the next 24 hours. A\nhurricane watch means a storm with winds of 74 mph or greater could\nhit within the next 36 hours.\n\n\n   At 2 p.m. EDT, Gordon was located near latitude 24.1 north and\nlongitude 86.1 west - about 345 miles southwest of Tampa. Its winds\nhave increased from 65 to 70 mph, 4 mph below hurricane strength.\n\n\n   Two to five inches of rain are expected across portions of South\nFlorida and the Keys on Saturday, forecasters said.\n\n\n   Saturday afternoon, counties along central Florida's Gulf Coast\nbegan recommending voluntary evacuation for residents in barrier\nislands and coastal or low lying areas.\n\n\n   Disaster officials in Hernando, Manatee and Pinellas counties\ntold residents they should start packing, and that shelters would\nbe opened Saturday evening. Other counties were awaiting later\nforecasts before deciding whether of advise their residents to\nevacuate.\n\n\n   The storm is even causing some concern on Florida's Atlantic\ncoast - at Cape Canaveral, NASA considered Saturday moving space\nshuttle Discovery off its seaside launch pad and into it's hangar.\nDiscovery is scheduled to blast off on a space-station construction\nmission on Oct. 5.\n\n\n   Gordon's affect is already being felt in Cuba and Mexico.\n\n\n   Heavy rains of seven to 10 inches affected parts of western Cuba\nearly Saturday, and heavy rains were reported Friday on Mexico's\nYucatan Peninsula. That caused street flooding in the resort city\nof Cancun.\n\n\n   Meanwhile, tropical storm force winds struck Bermuda on Saturday\nas Hurricane Florence passed to the island nation's north, but the\nstorm is not expected to score a direct hit.\n\n\n   Winds of 60 mph hit Bermuda early Saturday, but no damage was\nreported, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\n\n   At 10 a.m. EDT, Florence was 180 miles north of Bermuda and was\nmoving to the northeast at 25 mph. Near its center, it still packed\nhurricane force winds of 75 mph, but those missed the island,\nforecasters said.\n\n\n   ''There was no structural damage.

''It'll mostly be a rain\nevent.''\n\n\n   At 11 p.m., the storm was centered 95 miles south of Pensacola\nwith sustained winds of near 65 mph. It was moving at 15 mph.\n\n\n   ''It's not that strong,'' said Bob McCabe at his home at Navarre\nBeach, 20 miles east of Pensacola. ''I'm hoping it hits east of\nhere. ... I'd rather see it fizzle.''\n\n\n   Evacuations normally are not required with a storm of Helene's\npredicted intensity, but authorities along the Gulf Coast prepared\ndisaster plans anyway.\n\n\n   Shelters were opened, military planes were evacuated from bases\nin the Florida Panhandle and schools districts in Okaloosa, Walton\nand Santa Rosa counties canceled Friday classes. Government offices\nalso were closed in Okaloosa County.\n\n\n   Helene was expected to cause storm-surge flooding of up to 5\nfeet above normal tide levels in some places, said Jack Beven, a\nspecialist with the hurricane center.\n\n\n   Tropical storm warnings stretched from Pascagoula, Miss. to\nFlorida's Aucilla River, southeast of Tallahassee. Flood warnings\nwere posted for parts of the Florida coast, still soggy from the\nweekend passage of Tropical Storm Gordon, and a flood watch was\nposted in northern Georgia.\n\n\n   Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Isaac, which strengthened from a\ndepression late Thursday, posed no threat to land. The storm is in\nthe far eastern Atlantic, south of the Cape Verde Islands off\nnorthwestern Africa.\n\n\n   ------\n\n\n   On the Net:\n\n\n   National Hurricane Center: http://www.nhc.noaa.gov\n\n\n AP-NY-09-22-00 0145",

      "content": "NEWS STORY \n 2000-05-10 15:55 \n Stronger Hurricanes Forecast in 2000  \nBy RANDOLPH E. SCHMID, Associated Press Writer\n\n\n   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hurricane season is fast approaching and the\noutlook isn't pretty.\n\n\n   Federal storm specialists predicted an above-average storm\nseason Wednesday, calling for stronger, longer-lasting storms this\nyear, and more of them.\n\n\n   Hurricane season officially begins June 1, and the outlook is\nfor 11 tropical storms, seven of which will be hurricanes, three of\nthem major.\n\n\n   ''This puts coastal areas and the Caribbean islands at a much\nhigher risk of experiencing a tropical storm or hurricane,'' said\nD. James Baker, head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric\nAdministration.\n\n\n   The forecast is similar to last year's, which was followed by a\nseries of serious storms, including Hurricane Floyd, that caused\nmassive evacuations along the Southeastern coast and then inundated\nNorth Carolina.\n\n\n   The La Nina cooling of water in the Pacific Ocean, the same\ncondition that influenced the 1999 season, remains in place, Baker\nsaid.\n\n\n   ''For this reason we expect we'll have another major economic\nimpact on the United States,'' he said.\n\n\n   ''It's not just about the number'' of storms, added Max\nMayfield, director of the National Hurricane Center in Miami.\n''What really counts is where they make landfall and how strong\nthey are. Just one hurricane over your community makes it a very\nbad year.''\n\n\n   James Lee Witt, director of the Federal Emergency Management\nAgency, stressed the importance of having a plan and being prepared\nfor the storms. He cited community efforts, including Project\nImpact, which helps people strengthen their homes against storms of\nall types.\n\n\n   Baker and Witt signed a memorandum pledging to work closely\ntogether to warn people of impending storms and help them prepare.\n\n\n   ''It doesn't matter how good the forecast is if people don't\nplan in advance,'' said Jack Kelly, director of the National\nWeather Service.\n\n\n   Last year's evacuations left thousands of people trapped on\njammed highways for hours and the forecasters said that is a\nproblem they hope to avoid in the future. Coastal areas subject to\nflooding need to be evacuated in storms, but not every place that\nmerely expects wind damage, they said.\n\n\n   ''You flee from storm surge, you hide from wind,'' said\nMayfield, calling on people to get storm shutters, build safe rooms\nand take other steps to prepare their homes.\n\n\n   The new outlook from the government forecasters echoes that of\nBill Gray of Colorado State University, one of the few willing to\nmake long-range storm predictions. For this season he also\npredicted 11 named storms.\n\n\n   Mayfield was picked last week to replace the retired Jerry\nJarrell as director of the hurricane center.\n\n\n   Also last week a new weather satellite was launched that can be\npressed into service this summer if needed. The $220 million GOES-L\nsatellite had been delayed a year.\n\n\n   The forecasters rely on two Geostationary Operational\nEnvironmental Satellites to monitor tropical storms and other\nsevere weather. The East Coast's GOES-8, however, is a year beyond\nits design lifetime. Although still working, it could break down at\nany moment. GOES-L is a crucial backup.\n\n\n   While some climate experts have been blaming the increase in\ntropical storms in recent years on global warming, Gray says the\ntrend is cyclical and not related to warming.\n\n\n   Asked about this Wednesday, Baker agreed. ''We don't see, at\nthis point, a link between global warming and tropical cyclone\nactivity,'' he said.\n\n\n   Tropical cyclones is another name for hurricanes, which are also\ncalled typhoons in some parts of the world.\n\n\n   Over the last three decades forecasters have gotten better at\npredicting where the storms will go, researchers Colin McAdie and\nMiles Lawrence report in the May issue of the Bulletin of the\nAmerican Meteorological Society.\n\n\n   They found that from 1970 to 1998 track forecast errors\ndecreased by about 1 percent per year for the 24-hour forecast.\n\n\n   ''On a yearly basis, it's",

      "content": "TROPICAL STORM HARVEY DOES NOT PACK MUCH OF A PUNCH \n\n\n\n   MIAMI _ As Floridians asked themselves how anyone could be all\nthat afraid of a tropical storm named Harvey, people in the\nsouthern tip of the state wearily endured this latest bout with bad\nweather with more impatience than trepidation.\n\n\n   An unexpected change in direction shifted the ragged tropical\nstorm away from the densely populated Tampa Bay area and into\nFlorida's southwestern Gulf Coast. Although the storm forced the\nclosing of schools and triggered an emergency declaration from Gov.\nJeb Bush, in the end heavy rains and some flooding were the worst\nthe storm could do.\n\n\n   In fact, said environmentalists, the state needed the heavy\nrains in its South Florida wetlands to help replenish the aquifer\nand swamps so that fish, wading birds and other wildlife will have\nenough water to make it through the dry season this winter.\n\n\n   The tropical storm came ashore less than a week after Hurricane\nFloyd, a massive storm four times the size of the destructive\nHurricane Andrew in 1992, pounded the Bahamas and skirted the\nFlorida coastline before blowing along the Eastern Seaboard,\nkilling more than 60 people.\n\n\n   The center of Harvey, with winds around 50 mph, came ashore\nTuesday morning in Collier County on the Gulf Coast. Then, with\nwinds weakening to below 40 mph, the tropical strom washed across\nthe Everglades before bringing rain into Miami and the rest of\nSouth Florida.\n\n\n   Forecasters had feared that the storm would enter the state at\nTampa Bay and head northeast, perhaps bringing more hard rain and\nmisery to the Carolinas, which were ravaged by floods from\nHurricane Floyd. But instead, the storm weakened Tuesday and a cold\nfront turned the storm to the southeast, across the state's\nsouthern peninsula and into the Atlantic.\n\n\n   With the Tampa area spared the brunt of the storm Tuesday, a\ncruise ship was able to limp back to port under the power of one\nengine. On Sunday, an engine room fire had knocked out both\nengines, stranding the ship and the 1,700 people aboard in the Gulf\nof Mexico.\n\n\n   With the storm's new course, its impact on the Carolinas, if\nany, would be slight, said weather experts at the National\nHurricane Center in Miami.\n\n\n   ``This isn't anything to worry about by any means,'' said Lixion\nAvila, a hurricane specialist with the National Hurricane Center,\nas the storm staggered across the southern tip of the state and\ntook aim at the open Atlantic. ``This is a poorly defined tropical\nstorm. It will dump some rain. It will only move around a couple of\ntree branches and lightweight street debris. That's all.''\n\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n\n   The storm deluged Collier County with some 10 inches of rain,\nflooding streets and sending water into 35 homes and about the same\nnumber of businesses, said Ken Pineau, the emergency management\ndirector for Collier County.\n\n\n   In Everglades City, a town of about 600 people some 40 miles\neast of Naples, Martha Daniels, the city clerk, sat in her office\nand watched the streets flood all around City Hall.\n\n\n   ``City Hall is an island,'' she said. ``We're watching the tide\ngo by. We see these little reddish-brown piles floating by _\nmillions of ants on top of each other. We saw a telephone pole go\nby a while ago. Now we're seeing somebody go by in a canoe. You\ncan't tell what's road, what's lawn. It all looks the same under\nwater.''\n\n\n   But no one seemed to be panicking. In the nearby small town of\nOchopee, Vince Doerr, a retired firefighter, watched the heavy\nrains more with interest than fear.\n\n\n   ``We can take it better than they can in Miami, I guess on\naccount of all those roads and shopping centers,'' Doerr said. ``It\nslows the water down. Here it flows real natural.''\n\n\n   The storm was expected to bring rains of from 2 to 5 inches to\nthe Miami area.\n\n\n   Meanwhile, environmentalists were grateful for the rain.\n\n\n   ``These rains are crucial,'' said Ed Carlson, manager of the\nCorkscrew Swamp Sanctuary, about 30 miles north of Naples. ``This\nis the kind of rain that co",

SCHMID, Associated Press Writer\n\n\n   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hurricane season is fast approaching and the\noutlook isn't pretty.\n\n\n   Federal storm specialists predicted an above-average storm\nseason Wednesday, calling for stronger, longer-lasting storms this\nyear, and more of them.\n\n\n   Hurricane season officially begins June 1, and the outlook is\nfor 11 tropical storms, seven of which will be hurricanes, three of\nthem major.\n\n\n   ''This puts coastal areas and the Caribbean islands at a much\nhigher risk of experiencing a tropical storm or hurricane,'' said\nD. James Baker, head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric\nAdministration.\n\n\n   The forecast is similar to last year's, which was followed by a\nseries of serious storms, including Hurricane Floyd, that caused\nmassive evacuations along the Southeastern coast and then inundated\nNorth Carolina.\n\n\n   The La Nina cooling of water in the Pacific Ocean, the same\ncondition that influenced the 1999 season, remains in place, Baker\nsaid.\n\n\n   ''For this reason we expect we'll have another major economic\nimpact on the United States,'' he said.\n\n\n   ''It's not just about the number'' of storms, added Max\nMayfield, director of the National Hurricane Center in Miami.\n''What really counts is where they make landfall and how strong\nthey are. Just one hurricane over your community makes it a very\nbad year.''\n\n\n   James Lee Witt, director of the Federal Emergency Management\nAgency, stressed the importance of having a plan and being prepared\nfor the storms. He cited community efforts, including Project\nImpact, which helps people strengthen their homes against storms of\nall types.\n\n\n   A poll the agency released Wednesday revealed that more than\nhalf of people vulnerable to hurricane damage don't prepare\nadequately because they underestimate their risk. Poll takers also\nconcluded that many do little to protect their homes because they\nthink the cost is much higher than it actually is. One-third of the\nhomeowners do not have an evacuation plan.\n\n\n   More than 1,200 people from Massachusettes to Texas were\nquestioned for the poll in April and May. The margin of error was\nplus or minus 3 percentage points.\n\n\n   Baker and Witt signed a memorandum pledging to work closely\ntogether to warn people of impending storms and help them prepare.\n\n\n   ''It doesn't matter how good the forecast is if people don't\nplan in advance,'' said Jack Kelly, director of the National\nWeather Service.\n\n\n   Last year's evacuations left thousands of people trapped on\njammed highways for hours and the forecasters said that is a\nproblem they hope to avoid in the future. Coastal areas subject to\nflooding need to be evacuated in storms, but not every place that\nmerely expects wind damage, they said.\n\n\n   ''You flee from storm surge, you hide from wind,'' said\nMayfield, calling on people to get storm shutters, build safe rooms\nand take other steps to prepare their homes.\n\n\n   The new outlook from the government forecasters echoes that of\nBill Gray of Colorado State University, one of the few willing to\nmake long-range storm predictions. For this season he also\npredicted 11 named storms.\n\n\n   Mayfield was picked last week to replace the retired Jerry\nJarrell as director of the hurricane center.\n\n\n   Also last week a new weather satellite was launched that can be\npressed into service this summer if needed. The $220 million GOES-L\nsatellite had been delayed a year.\n\n\n   The forecasters rely on two Geostationary Operational\nEnvironmental Satellites to monitor tropical storms and other\nsevere weather. The East Coast's GOES-8, however, is a year beyond\nits design lifetime. Although still working, it could break down at\nany moment. GOES-L is a crucial backup.\n\n\n   While some climate experts have been blaming the increase in\ntropical storms in recent years on global warming, Gray says the\ntrend is cyclical and not related to warming.\n\n\n   Asked about this Wednesday, Baker agreed.

Jeb Bush on\nSaturday activated emergency response teams.\n\n\n   State officials said they expect Gordon to be a Category 1\nhurricane with winds of 74 to 95 mph when it strikes land anywhere\nbetween Fort Myers and the Panhandle sometime late Sunday.\n\n\n   Rains of five inches or more are expected and coastal areas\ncould expect a storm surge, said Joe Myers, the state emergency\nmanagement director.\n\n\n   The National Hurricane Center issued a tropical storm warning\nSaturday that covered a 210-mile stretch from Bonita Beach just\nsouth of Fort Myers to the Suwanee River, about 100 miles north of\nTampa.\n\n\n   Forecasters also issued a hurricane watch for a 400-mile stretch\nfrom Bonita Beach to the Panhandle town of Apalachicola. They said\nGordon could reach hurricane strength by late Saturday.\n\n\n   A tropical storm warning means a storm with winds of between 39\nand 73 mph is expected to hit an area within the next 24 hours. A\nhurricane watch means a storm with winds of 74 mph or greater could\nhit within the next 36 hours.\n\n\n   At 10 a.m. EDT, Gordon was located about 355 miles southwest of\nTampa, with winds of 65 mph, 9 mph below hurricane strength. Two to\nfive inches of rain are expected across portions of South Florida\nand the Keys on Saturday, forecasters said.\n\n\n   Saturday afternoon, counties along central Florida's Gulf Coast\nbegan recommending voluntary evacuation for residents in barrier\nislands and coastal or low lying areas.\n\n\n   Disaster officials in Hernando, Manatee and Pinellas counties\ntold residents they should start packing, and that shelters would\nbe opened Saturday evening. Other counties were awaiting later\nforecasts before deciding whether of advise their residents to\nevacuate.\n\n\n   The storm is even causing some concern on Florida's Atlantic\ncoast - at Cape Canaveral, NASA considered Saturday moving space\nshuttle Discovery off it's seaside launch pad and into it's hangar.\nDiscovery is scheduled to blast off on a space-station construction\nmission on Oct. 5.\n\n\n   Gordon's affect is already being felt in Cuba and Mexico.\n\n\n   Heavy rains of seven to 10 inches affected parts of western Cuba\nearly Saturday, and heavy rains were reported Friday on Mexico's\nYucatan Peninsula. That caused street flooding in the resort city\nof Cancun.\n\n\n   Meanwhile, tropical storm force winds struck Bermuda on Saturday\nas Hurricane Florence passed to the island nation's north, but the\nstorm is not expected to score a direct hit.\n\n\n   Winds of 60 mph hit Bermuda early Saturday, but no damage was\nreported, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\n\n   At 7 a.m. EDT, Florence was 125 miles north of Bermuda and was\nmoving to the northeast at 25 mph. Near its center, it still packed\nhurricane force winds of 75 mph, but those are expected to miss the\nisland, forecasters said.\n\n\n   Rip currents associated with Florence were blamed for at least\nthree surf deaths Tuesday in North Carolina.\n\n\n   Meanwhile, a third disturbance was sighted in the tropics.\n\n\n   A tropical depression with 35 mph winds was located about 260\nmiles east of Guadeloupe in the Leeward Islands and was moving west\nnear 17 mph.\n\n\n   A tropical storm watch is in effect for the islands of Antigua,\nAnguilla, Barbuda, Montserrat, Nevis, St. Kitts, St. Maarten, Saba\nand St. Eustatius in the Leeward Islands.\n\n\n   Wind gusts to tropical storm force in squalls are likely over\nparts of the Leewards later Saturday.\n\n\n   On the Net:\n\n\n   National Hurricane Center: http://www.nhc.noaa.gov\n\n\n AP-ES-09-16-00 1327",

The same \nconditions have not been seen since the late 1960s. \n\n\n\tThe 1999 season will have 14 named storms and nine hurricanes,  \nfour of them major, Gray predicted. ``That's a very active \nseason,'' he said. \n\n\n\tFlorida could experience severe damage sometime in the near  \nfuture because of the upswing in the number of storms and because \nmore people are living in storm-prone areas. \n\n\n\t``We're going to be seeing a $50 billion-, $70 billion-, $100  \nbillion-damage storm,'' Gray said. ``Florida is a sitting duck.'' \n\n\n\tOver the last 30 years, an average of about 10 tropical storms  \nhave occurred annually, and five or six have reached hurricane \nstrength. \n\n\n\tThe hurricane season begins June 1 and lasts through Nov. 30.  \n\n\n\tGov.

There's no\nquestion about it. But you and I didn't get hurricane conditions.\nWe got tropical storm conditions.''\n\n\n   Palm Beach County's emergency management director, Bill O'Brien,\nwas more critical of himself than the hurricane center on Tuesday,\nsaying his office opened shelters for people who didn't feel\ncomfortable in their homes but in hindsight, should have encouraged\nmobile home evacuations.\n\n\n   ``I know those guys do the very best they can,'' O'Brien said of\nthe hurricane center.\n\n\n   Jarrell said the storm's path shifted in those crucial hours on\nFriday because its eye reformed several times over land, each time\nmoving to the east _ a phenomenon forecasters can't explain. He\nsaid such events occurred last year in several storms in the Gulf\nof Mexico, with the eye jumping as much as 75 miles over to the\neast. Jarrell said that's why tracking charts showed a steady track\nto the northeast even as the center continued to forecast a\nnorthern path.\n\n\n   ``If you're connecting the dots, it was'' heading north, Jarrell\nsaid. ``But if you're watching the eye, you're seeing it reform.''\n\n\n   Jarrell said that the strongest rains were farther east of\ncenter, and had the storm stayed on a path west of Lake Okeechobee,\ncoastal Palm Beach County and the Treasure Coast would have\nreceived even more rain.\n\n\n   Jarrell also said a fire last month inside a weather computer in\nMaryland may have contributed to the less-than-exact forecast. The\ncenter made only two models a day instead of four, while other\nagencies' computers were available to do the other two models.\nJarrell said that may have hampered the forecasting but it was\nearly too say.\n\n\n   The center also suggested on Tuesday that employers consider\nsending employees home in a tropical storm warning instead of a\nhurricane warning.\n\n\n   ``It's just a meteorological distinction between 73 mph as a\ntropical storm and 74 mph as a hurricane,'' National Hurricane\nCenter spokesman Frank Lepore said.\n\n\n   ``I guess that's natural,'' O'Brien said. ``People hear\n`hurricane' and they think anything from what we saw to Andrew. We\nhave some strong storms on a routine basis in the summer that have\ntropical storm force winds.''\n\n\n   Gary Hines, senior vice president of the Business Development\nBoard of Palm Beach County, said the idea of companies sending\nworkers home in tropical storm warnings is ``worth the weather\nservice presenting it to employers.''\n\n\n   Jarrell said the center doesn't want to get into the business of\ndeciding when to open shelters, evacuate or order employees home.\n\n\n   ``Emergency management folks feel that is not our business,''\nJarrell said. ``We agree with that.''\n\n\n   Residents who suffered storm damage will base their insurance\nclaims, and deductibles, on a hurricane strike, said Don Pride,\nspokesman for the Florida Department of Insurance.\n\n\n   Eliot Kleinberg writes for the Palm Beach Post, West Palm Beach,\nFla.

''We're going to be on the\nextreme outer fringe and we're not looking for winds to be that\nstrong.''\n\n\n   After weakening overnight, the storm began intensifying Monday\nwith winds reaching 70 mph, just below hurricane-strength winds of\nat least 74 mph.\n\n\n   That strengthening caused a new center of circulation to form\nnorth of the previous track, pulling the storm further north away\nfrom the islands, Komada said.\n\n\n   Forecasters said data from radar and hurricane-tracking planes\nshowed that Daniel formed an eye early Monday. Then, just as\nquickly, the eye disappeared.\n\n\n   ''It might briefly have become a hurricane,'' said Jim Weyman,\ndirector of the Central Pacific Hurricane Center.\n\n\n   Earlier Monday, a tropical storm warning was in effect for the\nislands of Oahu, Maui, Molokai and Lanai, and a tropical storm\nwatch was in effect on Kauai. Those were canceled at 11 p.m. EDT.\n\n\n   Maui County closed schools and county offices Monday, and state\nofficials told nonessential personnel to stay home. On Molokai,\nofficials closed the Kalaupapa National Historical Park.\n\n\n   To the southeast, the storm caused few problems Sunday when it\ncame closest to the Big Island, Hawaii, bringing surf of up to 10\nfeet to east-facing beaches. Many beaches, trails and campsites\nwere closed.\n\n\n   Farmers hoped the predicted heavy rains would bring some relief\nto drought-stricken areas of the state, but forecasters said late\nMonday that the most they could expect was some localized showers.\n\n\n   ------\n\n\n   On the Net: http://www.nws.noaa.gov/pr/hnl/index.shtml\n\n\n AP-NY-08-01-00 0030",
