      "content": "RECORDINGS PLAYED IN TRIAL OF 3 EX-ARCHER OFFICIALS\n\n\n\n   CHICAGO _ A Japanese agricultural executive identified two\nformer senior officers of Archer Daniels Midland Co. as having met\nwith him in a price-fixing conspiracy, on a day when secret\ngovernment recordings of pricing discussions were played in public\nfor the first time.\n\n\n   The information emerged in the first day of evidence in the\ntrial of three executives who worked for ADM. The testimony and\nrecordings underscored the deep sense of distrust and dislike among\nthe companies that have already pleaded guilty to conspiring to fix\nthe price of lysine, a feed additive.\n\n\n   In one document, an Asian lysine producer raised the possibility\nof bombing Archer Daniel's lysine plant, to slow the company's\nentry into the business. And, on tape recordings, a Japanese\nexecutive discussed how a Korean company that had agreed to fix\nprices ``by nature will tell a lie.''\n\n\n   The government has charged the three former executives _ Michael\nAndreas, the vice chairman who is on leave from the company;\nTerrance Wilson, head of the company's corn processing division,\nand Mark Whitacre, the head of its bioproducts division _ with\nparticipating in the conspiracy from 1991 to 1995.\n\n\n   The tape recordings were obtained from Whitacre, who became a\ngovernment informant less than a year after prosecutors say the\nscheme involving Archer Daniels began. But he became a defendant in\nthe case after the government learned he had violated his\ncooperation agreement by taking millions of dollars from Archer\nDaniels.\n\n\n   In the testimony, Kanji Mimoto, an executive with Ajinimoto Co.\nof Tokyo, said that competitors in the lysine business had engaged\nin price fixing long before Archer Daniels entered the market in\nthe early 1990s. But, he said, Archer Daniels executives were the\nfirst to push efforts to control production volumes, which would\nhelp guarantee the effectiveness of a price-fixing scheme.\n\n\n   Many of the discussions on production floundered, however,\nbecause of insistence by Archer Daniels that it be assigned as much\nvolume as Ajinimoto, then the largest lysine producer in the\nbusiness, Mimoto said.\n\n\n   ``What I remember strongly, was that Terry Wilson said that as a\ncompany policy, ADM must have the same share as the market leader''\nunder such an agreement, he said.\n\n\n   In a later phone call, Mimoto said, Whitacre told him that he\nwas interested in increasing the price, even without a volume\nagreement in place. That call took place before Whitacre began\nworking for the government.\n\n\n   Two recorded calls with Mimoto, made by Whitacre after his\ncooperation began, were played in court. At times in in recording,\nthe men used fictitious names. In the first, the two men haggled\nover how high lysine prices should go. In the second, Mimoto\nexpressed concerns about meeting in the United States because of\npossible legal problems.\n\n\n   ``We know that in the United States the antitrust statutes are\nvery severe,'' he said in the recording. ``So, as much as possible,\nwe wanted to avoid the United States.''\n\n\n   Earlier in the day, Reid Weingarten, a lawyer for Wilson,\npresented his opening statement. In it, he said that the words of\nWilson captured on tape were not what they appeared, largely\nbecause his client was lying to the competitors in an effort to\nbreak up the Asian cartel.\n\n\n   As evidence, he cited a secretly recorded statement made by\nWilson late in the investigation that he said proved there was no\ntrue price-fixing effort. ``If we were trying to fix prices,''\nWeingarten quoted him as saying, ``Then we ought to be fired'' for\nincompetence. &QL;",

      "content": "PRICE-FIXING TRIAL OPENS FOR 3 EX-ARCHER OFFICIALS \n\n\n\n   CHICAGO _ In opening arguments in one of the largest\nprice-fixing trials ever, a federal prosecutor said Wednesday that\nformer senior executives with Archer Daniels Midland Co. ``were\ncaught red-handed'' on secret recordings conspiring with\ncompetitors to set the market prices for a popular feed additive.\n\n\n   But a defense lawyer for one of the executives challenged that\nclaim, saying that the recordings of his client had captured very\nlittle, and that meetings the government portrayed as incriminating\ninvolved little more than discussions about the functioning of the\nmarket for the additive, lysine.\n\n\n   In the opening statements, the two sides disclosed for the first\ntime that price fixing in the lysine market predated the entry of\nArcher Daniels in the business, involving a small cartel of\nJapanese and other Asian companies. And a defense lawyer also said\nthat, during investigation the government's chief informant on at\nleast one occasion secretly taped an FBI agent involved in the\ncase.\n\n\n   Three former executives from Archer Daniels _ Michael D.\nAndreas, the former vice chairman who is on leave from the company;\nTerrance Wilson, the former head of the company's corn processing\ndivision, and Mark E. Whitacre, the former head of its bioproducts\ndivision _ were charged by the government as participating in the\nconspiracy.\n\n\n   But it is Whitacre who will clearly be at center stage\nthroughout most of the trial. It was Whitacre who first disclosed\nthe price fixing between the competitors and who secretly recorded\nconversations over two and a half years. But he became a defendant\nin the case after the government learned he had violated his\ncooperation agreement by taking millions of dollars from Archer\nDaniels, even as he was working with law enforcement officials.\n\n\n   Over more than an hour, the prosecutor, James M. Griffin,\nmethodically described the government's evidence, as he led the\njury through a narrative of the major meetings during which the\nlysine competitors agreed to fix prices and allocate production\nvolumes among themselves.\n\n\n   Griffin said that to prove the crime the government had only to\nprovide evidence that an agreement to fix prices had been reached.\n\n\n   ``The agreement is the crime,'' he said. ``It does not matter if\nthe conspirators kept the agreement.''\n\n\n   Griffin said that the government would prove that price fixing\nwas nothing new at Archer Daniels. For example, he said that one\nwitness would testify that Wilson had been fixing prices on citric\nacid, a food additive, since 1991, before the lysine scheme began.\n\n\n   Griffin added that the taped evidence alone proved the roles of\nAndreas and Wilson. ``Michael Andreas and Terry Wilson were caught\nred-handed on audio and videotape committing the crime they are\ncharged with,'' he said.\n\n\n   But John Bray, a lawyer for Andreas, said that there was no\ncompelling recordings clearly proving that his client had engaged\nin wrongdoing, and that he was innocent. ``If ever there was a\ncase, ever, where there are two sides to the story, then this is\nit,'' Bray said.\n\n\n   Rather than encouraging lawbreaking, Andreas was trying to take\non the illegal Asian cartel, Bray said. At times, he said, his\nclient can be heard on tape saying that Archer Daniels ``does not\nmake deals'' with competitors relating to price and volume.\nMoreover, Bray said, the tapes that do exist are ambiguous as to\ntheir meaning.\n\n\n   The reason the case emerged, Bray said, was that in 1992\nWhitacre had falsely told Archer Daniels that a competitor was\nattempting to extort millions of dollars from the company. Archer\nDaniels called in the government, and the FBI went to discuss the\nallegations with Whitacre. During that visit, Whitacre told the\nagent about a price-fixing conspiracy. Bray contended that the\nrevelation was designed to take attention away from the bogus\nextortion story, which he said Whitacre had concocted for his own\nenrichment.\n\n\n   In his opening, Bill T. Walker, a lawyer for Whitacre, said that\nthe opening",

A number of \nemployees have been prosecuted, including three senior ADM \nexecutives who were sentenced to prison in July. \n\n\n\tAll four companies also settled civil suits by bottlers and  \nprocessors. \n\n\n\tBut Cargill, based in Minneapolis, insisted it had no part in  \nany conspiracy and simply followed a common practice of basing its \nprices on those of its competitors. \n\n\n\tCitric acid, with worldwide sales of $2 billion to $3 billion a  \nyear, is used to extend the shelf life of soft drinks, canned \nfruits and vegetables, detergents, drugs and cosmetics. \n\n\n\tThe four companies admitted agreeing between 1991 and 1995 to  \ndivide the market and raise prices by limiting sales. \n\n\n\tCargill entered the market in the late 1980s and gained a 20  \npercent U.S. share by the mid-1990s. \n\n\n\tThe suit, a class action by Varni Brothers Corp. and the 7-Up  \nBottling Co. of Philadelphia, accused Cargill of joining the \nconspiracy in 1993 when it joined the European Citric Acid \nManufacturers Association, a group to which the other four \ncompanies belonged. \n\n\n\tThe suit noted that Cargill had announced in early 1992 that it  \nplanned to double its citric acid production capacity but announced \nin late 1992 that it would increase capacity only 50 percent. The \nsuit also cited an FBI report in one of the criminal cases that \nquoted Barrie Cox, an ADM employee, as saying he had frequent \ndiscussions with Cargill's national sales director about citric \nacid bidding prices in 1995. \n\n\n\tBut the appeals court largely discounted Cox's statements,  \nsaying they showed, at most, ``sporadic price discussions'' two \nyears after Cargill was alleged to have joined the conspiracy. \n\n\n\tCargill's scaling back of its expansion plans, and its posting  \nof prices that largely mirrored those of its competitors, were not \nevidence of a conspiracy, said Judge Diarmuid O'Scannlain in the \n3-0 ruling. He said Cargill's expansion of its U.S. market share \ncame largely at the expense of ADM and Haarman &AMP; Reimer. \n\n\n\tOf the companies that admitted fixing prices, ``none identified  \nCargill as a co-conspirator,'' O'Scannlain said. \n\n\n\tTherese Stewart, a lawyer for the companies that sued Cargill,  \nsaid the court disregarded an earlier antitrust decision and made \nit extremely difficult to get a price-fixing conspiracy case to \ntrial. Even ``evidence of actual agreement between an admitted \nconspirator and the defendant on certain bid prices'' isn't enough, \nshe said, referring to the FBI's statement from Cox. \n\n\n\tBut Richard Favretto, a lawyer for Cargill, said Cox's  \nstatements were never corroborated and were considered by the \nfederal government in a four-year investigation that cleared the \ncompany. \n\n\n\tThe ruling is ``a further vindication of our position,'' he  \nsaid.",

The meeting, in a private room\nat the Marriott Hotel in Irvine, Calif., was terse and\nbusinesslike. But the topic of discussion, the government says, was\na crime.\n\n\n   For several hours, the four men _ two from Archer Daniels\nMidland Co. and two from Ajinimoto Co. of Japan _ haggled over\nvolume production numbers, arguing over the accuracy of data they\nwere providing each other about their companies' sales of a feed\nadditive. It was, prosecutors say, the critical stage in conspiracy\nthat had lasted more than a year to fix prices of the additive.\n\n\n   And unknown to all but one man in the room at that meeting in\nOctober 1993, every word was being videotaped.\n\n\n   More than three years after government raids disclosed the\nexistence of a huge price-fixing investigation, prosecutors played\nthat videotape Monday to a federal jury that is hearing the\ncriminal price-fixing case against three former Archer Daniels\nexecutives. All three men have pleaded not guilty.\n\n\n   If the government is right in its claims, the videotape offers\nan unprecedented look into what the government contends was a\nprice-fixing conspiracy on a giant scale, involving every major\ncompany in the business of producing the additive, which is called\nlysine. It shows the executives of the two largest companies in the\nbusiness discussing how they would dictate the annual growth in\nproduction to the other lysine makers, and debating the tactical\nbenefits of simply lying to the others about certain data.\n\n\n   But the tape has already played a critical role in reshaping the\nfuture of Archer Daniels, the politically powerful grain giant. For\nit is the crucial evidence against one defendant, Michael Andreas,\nthe son and former heir apparent to the powerful company's\nchairman, Dwayne Andreas.\n\n\n   Also charged in the case are Terrance Wilson, the former head of\nthe company's corn-processing division, and Mark Whitacre, the\nformer head of its bioproducts unit, which produces lysine.\n\n\n   The government has already secured guilty pleas from some of the\nexecutives involved in the conspiracy and each of the companies;\nArcher Daniels agreed to pay $100 million in 1996 to settle\nprice-fixing charges.\n\n\n   Since the investigation was first disclosed, much of the public\nattention has focused on Whitacre, who served as a government\ninformant during the inquiry and secretly recorded his colleagues\nover more than two years. But he became a defendant in the case\nafter the government learned he had violated his cooperation\nagreement by illegally taking millions of dollars from Archer\nDaniels through a complex fraud.\n\n\n   Indeed, much of the defense centers on Whitacre. Lawyers for\nAndreas and Wilson have argued that he manipulated investigators\nand Archer Daniels officials to create evidence of a conspiracy.\nThe defense lawyers have argued that many of the conversations\ncaptured on the recordings either involve innocent business\ndiscussions or were elaborate efforts to trick Asian competitors\ninto providing information that would allow Archer Daniels to gauge\nthe size of the lysine market.\n\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n\n   But the hearing Monday focused solely on the price-fixing\nallegations that began the investigation.

It comes just\nmonths after the companies agreed to pay record fines in settling a\ncriminal complaint from the Justice Department.\n\n\n   The seven companies had been accused in both cases of plotting,\nfor nearly a decade, to artificially inflate the prices of the raw\nvitamin blends that go into everything from milk and breakfast\ncereal to animal feed. The blends involve vitamins A, C and E and a\nvariety of the B-complex vitamins, including beta-carotene.\n\n\n   The class-action case was brought by direct purchasers of bulk\nvitamins, including some of the world's largest food, beverage and\nanimal feed companies, like Kellogg, Kraft and Tyson Foods.\n\n\n   The settlement payments are expected to compensate those\npurchasers, rather than ordinary consumers.\n\n\n   As indirect purchasers of raw vitamin mixtures, consumers have\nbeen overpaying for everything from vitamin tablets to the small\nportions of vitamins added into everyday foods. But although\nlawyers involved in the case say consumers may be compensated as\npart of state class-action suits pending against the vitamin\nmakers, few think any such settlements would be as large as the\nprivate settlement that was announced Wednesday.\n\n\n   The vitamin makers, several of which have already settled\ngovernment charges in Canada, are also facing antitrust\ninvestigations in Europe.\n\n\n   As a result of the conspiracy, which lasted from 1990 to 1998,\nthe seven companies had already agreed to pay nearly $2 billion in\ngovernment and class-action settlements for fixing the prices of\nvitamins in the United States.\n\n\n   The companies that settled Wednesday are Roche of Switzerland,\nBASF of Germany, Rhone-Poulenc of France, Hoechst Marion Roussel of\nGermany, Takeda Chemical of Japan, Eisai Co. of Japan and Daiichi\nPharmaceutical of Japan.

Takeda is the largest pharmaceutical company in Japan.\nNo executives were charged.\n\n\n   Takeda, which sold vitamins B and C, released a statement late\nThursday saying it deeply regretted the matter and that any\nemployees involved in the case would be disciplined. The company\nsaid all managers, executives, board members and an auditor would\nhave their pay reduced.\n\n\n   Officials at Daiichi, which sold vitamin B, could not be reached\nfor comment.\n\n\n   Cathy Pollini, a spokeswoman at the U.S. subsidiary of Eisai,\nwhich sold vitamin E, said Thursday that she could only confirm\nthat the company was cooperating with the Justice Department's\ninvestigation of anti-competitive practices in the vitamins market.\n\n\n   ``The prosecution of these three Japanese companies further\ndemonstrates the truly international aspect of the vitamin\nconspiracy,'' Joel I. Klein, the assistant attorney general in\ncharge of the antitrust division, said in a statement. ``By\nconspiring to fix the prices and allocate the sales of these\nvitamins, these companies and their co-conspirators reaped hundreds\nof millions of dollars in additional revenues.''\n\n\n   Last May, Hoffmann-LaRoche, a unit of Roche Holding of\nSwitzerland, agreed to pay $500 million and BASF AG of Germany\nagreed to pay $225 million to settle accusations that they\nmaster-minded the vitamin conspiracy, along with Rhone-Poulenc of\nFrance, which was not fined because it cooperated in the early days\nof the government investigation. It was the largest settlement ever\nin a federal antitrust case.\n\n\n   Two Roche executives also pleaded guilty and agreed to serve\njail terms in the United States. One of those executives had misled\ninvestigators in an earlier investigation into price-fixing at\nRoche, the government said.\n\n\n   In late 1998, another vitamin maker, Lonza AG of Switzerland,\nalso pleaded guilty to price fixing in the vitamins market and\nagreed to pay $10.5 million.\n\n\n   The government said Thursday that all three Japanese companies\nand many of their executives were cooperating with the\ninvestigation, which industry experts sai",

The investigation and trial have already\nbeen declared hallmarks by the government, which said it upended a\nconspiracy that controlled the prices of $1 billion in commerce\nworldwide.\n\n\n   But the case and Thursday's verdict also has had an enormous\nimpact as well on Archer Daniels _ a food giant that advertises\nitself as the ``supermarket to the world'' because it is a leading\nprocessor of corn, oilseeds and wheat. The Decatur, Ill.-based\ncompany's influence extends to virtually every grocery store aisle.\n\n\n   For decades, it has been run as a virtual family fief under the\niron-fisted control of Dwayne Andreas, one of the nation's most\npolitically powerful executives who is known by presidents and\nprime ministers alike. Despite that influence, Dwayne Andreas was\nunable to stop the weight of the judicial system from falling upon\nhis son and onetime heir apparent, Michael.\n\n\n   Over the seven-week trial, prosecutors presented evidence unlike\nany ever offered in court in a price-fixing case, including audio\nand video recordings of the illegal price-fixing meetings between\nthe defendants and their international competitors who made the\nadditive, known as lysine.\n\n\n   The evidence, including testimony from co-conspirators,\nportrayed price-fixing as common in the industry. Evidence was\noffered pointing to price-fixing in at least one other product, and\nconspiracies among foreign competitors that dated back decades.\n\n\n   The defendants were Michael Andreas, on paid leave from his\nposition of vice chairman with Archer Daniels; Terrance Wilson, a\nformer head of the company's corn-processing division, and Mark\nWhitacre, a former head of its bioproducts division, which\nmanufactures lysine.\n\n\n   Sentencing was set for Jan. 7. The men face a maximum penalty of\nthree years in jail and a $350,000 fine. But the defendants could\nbe forced to pay more, since under the law the government is\nallowed to seek twice the amount gained in the crime or lost by the\nvictims _ in this case, the purchasers of lysine.\n\n\n   Neither Andreas nor Wilson showed any emotion when the jury of\nsix men and six women announced their verdict. They left the\ncourtroom without comment. Whitacre, who waived his right to attend\nthe trial, was not in the courtroom.\n\n\n   Lawyers for Andreas and Wilson said that they would appeal the\nverdict. ``We've been fighting this for three years, and we are\ngoing to continue to fight it,'' said John Bray, a lawyer for\nAndreas. ``We're not through.''\n\n\n   Bill Walker, Whitacre's lawyer, said that he believed that the\njury had reached a conclusion on his client's guilt based in part\non the recorded evidence against the other defendants. ``I hate to\nuse the words `guilt by association,' but that's the way it\nseems,'' he said.\n\n\n   The conviction of Whitacre for price-fixing is the latest turn\nin a series that have bedeviled this case from the beginning. It\nwas Whitacre himself who first alerted the government to\nprice-fixing at Archer Daniels in 1992. For the next two and a half\nyears, he worked as a government informant, secretly recording\nmeetings with competitors and conversations at the highest reaches\nof the politically powerful grain giant.\n\n\n   But, soon after raids on Archer Daniels in 1995, Whitacre was\ndiscredited as a witness and eventually lost his immunity from\nprosecution when it was revealed that he had been secretly taking\nmillions of dollars from the company, even while working as a\ngovernment informant. Whitacre contended that the money was\nprovided as part of an under-the-table bonus plan at the compan",

It accused the vitamin makers\nof forming an international cartel that met regularly in hotel\nrooms, sometimes under the fictional name ``Vitamins Inc.,'' to\ndivide up the global market and artificially hike the prices of a\nwide range of vitamins, including Vitamins A, C and E, as well as\nBeta-Carotene, essential ingredients in the diet of virtually every\nAmerican.\n\n\n   ``There's an oral agreement on most material terms,'' said\nMichael Hausfeld, one of the lead attorneys in the class-action\nsuit, which he said could be settled in the next few weeks. ``It's\na significant recovery as well as a demonstration of the\neffectiveness of the antitrust laws.''\n\n\n   The class-action suit was brought by direct purchasers of\nvitamins for consumers, such as Coca-Cola, Kellogg's and Kraft\nFoods Inc., as well as by the animal feed companies, which supply\nvitamin-supplemented rations for poultry and livestock. The\ncompanies would have to decide whether to pass on settlement\nproceeds to consumers but are not obligated to do so. Consumers,\nwho are indirect purchasers of vitamins, are pursuing their own\nsettlement in a number of class-action suits at the state level.\n\n\n   If a final agreement is reached in the next few weeks, it would\ncome just months after two European pharmaceutical and chemical\ngiants _ Hoffman LaRoche, part of Roche Holding AG in Switzerland,\nand BASF AG of Germany _ agreed to pay $725 million, the largest\nantitrust fine in history, to settle similar price-fixing charges\nbrought by the Justice Department. Roche paid $500 million of that\nsum, with BASF paying the rest. A third big European company,\nRhone-Poulenc SA of France, was accused of being part of the\nconspiracy but the company avoided paying a fine because it\ncooperated with the Justice Department investigation.\n\n\n   All three European companies _ which produce more than 80\npercent of the world's vitamins _ have been negotiating to settle\nthe private class-action suits, and will pay the bulk of the $1.1\nbillion settlement, which was first reported Tuesday in the\nWashington Post.\n\n\n   Three Japanese companies, Daiichi Pharmaceutical Co., Eisai Co.\nand Takeda Chemical Industries Ltd., are also part of the\nsettlement talks.\n\n\n   A spokesman for Rhone-Poulenc declined comment on the settlement\nnegotiations. But an official at Hoffman-LaRoche said the company\nhad already set aside $640 million to settle civil class-action\nsuits. ``Negotiations are under way, and we think it will be\nsettled soon,'' said Martin Hirsch, a spokesman at Hoffman-LaRoche.\n\n\n   John Gilardi, a BASF spokesman, said in a telephone interview\nTuesday that the company was also moving toward an agreement. ``It\nis our desire to reach a comprehensive settlement and to put this\nmatter behind us,'' he said. ``We are in negotiations but it is\npremature to discuss the likelihood of success.''\n\n\n   People familiar with the talks said the six companies would pay\nmore than $1.1 billion to settle the lawsuits, with about $125\nmillion being set aside for attorney fees.

      "content": "ARCHER EXECUTIVE TESTIFIES TO FIXING CITRIC ACID PRICES \n\n\n\n   CHICAGO _ An executive withArcher Daniels Midland Co. testified\nWednesday that he and another senior executive at the grain giant\nhad participated in a global conspiracy with competitors to fix the\nprice of citric acid, a widely used food additive.\n\n\n   The testimony of Barrie Cox, an executive with the food\nadditives division of Archer Daniels, came in the criminal trial of\nthree former officers of the company who were charged with fixing\nthe price of lysine, an additive in animal feed.\n\n\n   While no one in the case has been charged with fixing prices of\ncitric acid, the government sought Cox's testimony to bolster its\ncharges in the lysine case, and to respond to defense arguments\nthat Archer Daniels executives adhered to antitrust laws, and were\nmore interested in cutting prices than fixing them.\n\n\n   Prosecutors have argued that Archer Daniels executives used the\nmethod of fixing prices of citric acid as a model in the subsequent\nlysine conspiracy. They argued that both systems involved\nallocating sales quantities to competitors, with almost identical\nmethods of reporting and auditing to insure the schemes were\nworking.\n\n\n   The three executives on trial are Michael D. Andreas, the former\nvice chairman of Archer Daniels; Terrance Wilson, the former head\nof the company's corn processing division; and Mark E. Whitacre,\nthe former head of its bioproducts division.\n\n\n   The role of Archer Daniels in fixing prices of the food additive\nwas no surprise _ the company pleaded guilty in 1996 to conspiring\nto rig both the prices of citric acid and lysine. And Cox offered\ntestimony about citric acid to the government that year as part of\na deal to reduce Archer Daniels' fine, which was eventually set at\n$100 million.\n\n\n   In his testimony, Cox said that Wilson took a direct role in\nfixing prices of citric acid. He said that he and Wilson traveled\nto meetings with four other European competitors, where both\nprice-fixing and volume allocation were discussed.\n\n\n   The system described by Cox was unusually detailed. The\nconspirators referred to themselves as the G-5, which stood for the\n``group of five.'' He said executives in the conspiracy were\ncharacterized as being in two categories: ``sherpas,'' who attended\nto the daily details of the scheme, and ``masters,'' who handled\nbroader strategy and planning.\n\n\n   Cox testified that the scheme began in the spring of 1991 and\nlasted through 1995. Often, he said, illegal meetings between the\ncitric acid producers were held in conjunction with official\nmeetings of a trade association, in order to provide the executives\nwith cover.\n\n\n   At one point in the conspiracy, Cox said that he had a\ndiscussion with Wilson about what would happen if the government\nlearned of the illegal scheme. He said that Wilson replied, ``If\never any of this goes wrong, you're on your own.''\n\n\n   Under cross-examination, Cox testified that he had learned\nduring his time at Archer Daniels that executives with his former\nemployer, Pfizer Inc., had held pricing discussions with\ncompetitors in the past. But he said that he was not aware of those\ndiscussions while he worked at the pharmaceutical giant.\n\n\n   Archer Daniels bought Pfizer's citric acid business in 1990.\nPfizer officials did not return telephone calls seeking comment on\nCox's testimony.",

The criminal\ninquiry is continuing, and people close to the investigation have\nsaid that Sotheby's was under pressure from prosecutors to reach a\nplea agreement.\n\n\n   Marcia Horowitz, a spokeswoman for Christie's, said on Wednesday\nthat the company had not filed its response to the civil suits but\nwould do so soon.\n\n\n   The potential damages to both houses from the civil suits are\nenormous. Litigants in antitrust cases can win triple damages, and\nthe tab could run into the tens of millions of dollars if the\nplaintiffs are successful, antitrust lawyers said.\n\n\n   The first civil suit was filed in federal court in Manhattan two\ndays after Christie's disclosed its agreement with the Justice\nDepartment. Since then, at least 55 other actions have been filed\nand consolidated in a single complaint that contends the two houses\ndefrauded buyers and sellers through a secret price-fixing scheme.\n\n\n   The suits have been consolidated before federal Judge Lewis A.\nKaplan of the Southern District of New York.\n\n\n   The suits contend that, beginning as early as 1992, executives\nof the two houses met secretly to fix the commissions charged to\nbuyers and sellers. They also contend that the executives agreed to\nstagger and coordinate auction dates to avoid competing.\n\n\n   According to the suits, the conspiracy robbed sellers and buyers\nof the ability to negotiate better commissions.\n\n\n   In its response, Sotheby's denied all allegations of wrongdoing\nin specific and dry legal language. It did say, however, that\nunidentified employees had coordinated sale dates with their\ncounterparts at Christie's. But Sotheby's said the coordination was\ndesigned to allow prospective buyers to attend sales at both\nhouses.\n\n\n   In addition to the civil suits, Sotheby's faces separate suits\nfrom shareholders. On Feb. 21, its chairman, A. Alfred Taubman, and\nits chief executive, Diana D.

And\nspokespersons for the three companies would only say that they are\ncooperating with federal investigators and seeking to resolve the\ncase.\n\n\n   ``We refuse to confirm or deny any speculation regarding a\nsettlement,'' said John Gilardi, a spokesman at BASF in Germany.\n``We are cooperating with the Justice Department investigation.''\n\n\n   Roche and Rhone-Poulenc issued similar statements.\n\n\n   A federal grand jury in Dallas has been probing price-fixing\nallegations in the vitamin market for more than a year and criminal\nindictments are expected to be handed up as soon as Thursday,\naccording to people close to the settlement. Several executives\ncould also be charged.\n\n\n   A number of class-action lawsuits have also been filed against\nthe European companies, alleging that over the past decade,\nexecutives at the three largest vitamin manufacturers _ Roche, BASF\nand Rhone-Poulenc _ and several smaller manufacturers and vitamin\nblenders, met secretly and agreed to fix prices and carve up\nterritories in the United States and elsewhere.\n\n\n   Robert Silver, an attorney at Boies &AMP; Schiller in Armonk, N.Y.,\nsaid his firm filed one of the earliest class-action suits in 1998,\nand then filed several more.\n\n\n   ``The lawsuits have alleged illegal conduct by an international\ncartel that deliberately targeted and severely burdened consumers\nin the United States,'' he said in an interview yesterday.\n\n\n   Whether or not a settlement takes place, federal prosecutors and\na number of class-action lawsuits have charged a massive global\nconspiracy that involved fixing prices of the sale of such common\nvitamins as vitamin A, C and E, as well as niacin and other B\ncomplex vitamins.\n\n\n   The cases involve everyday vitamins that are sold in\nsupermarkets and drugstores as well as the bulk sale of vitamins\nthat are fed to animals to produce a leaner and more healthy stock.\n\n\n   The federal investigation into collusion in the vitamin market\nis considered one of the most important anti-trust cases under\nreview by the Justice Department.

Hoffmann-LaRoche Ltd., a  \nSwiss pharmaceutical company, is the largest federal criminal fine \never imposed in any type of case, Attorney General Janet Reno told \na news conference. \n\n\n\tA German firm, BASF AG, agreed to pay a $225 million fine for  \nits role in the conspiracy to increase vitamin prices in the United \nStates and around the world. Both companies pleaded guilty in U.S. \nDistrict Court in Dallas. \n\n\n\tReno and aides said Americans unwittingly paid hundreds of  \nmillions of dollars in illegally inflated prices for vitamins and \nfood staples such as vitamin-enriched bread. \n\n\n\t``On a daily basis for the past 10 years, every American  \nconsumer paid to eat and drink or use a product whose price was \nartificially inflated,'' Reno said. \n\n\n\tThe vitamin cartel was the ``most pervasive and harmful criminal  \nantitrust conspiracy ever uncovered,'' said Assistant Attorney \nGeneral Joel I. Klein, Reno's antitrust chief. \n\n\n\t``The criminal conduct of these companies hurt the pocketbook of  \nvirtually every American consumer -- anyone who took a vitamin, \ndrank a glass of milk or had a bowl of cereal,'' Klein said. \n\n\n\tThe cartel boosted the price of more than $5 billion in products  \nsold in this country, he said. \n\n\n\tThe scheme lasted from January 1990 into February 1999. The  \nplotters boosted the cost of vitamins A, B2, B5, C, E and beta \ncarotene -- those most commonly taken as pills or added to enrich \nhuman foods like bread, milk, orange juice and breakfast cereal. \n\n\n\tThese illegal price increases also reached consumers through the  \ncost of animal products, because the vitamins are added to animal \nfeeds. The plotters are the world's largest producers of the most \ncommonly used vitamins. \n\n\n\tThe former director of worldwide marketing for Hoffmann-LaRoche  \nVitamins and Fine Chemicals Division, Dr. Kuno Sommer, agreed to \nplead guilty to helping run the cartel and lying to Justice \ninvestigators in 1997 to cover up the scheme. \n\n\n\tSommer, a Swiss citizen, agreed to serve a four-month prison  \nterm and pay a $100,000 fine. ``For the first time in our history, \na European national will plead guilty and, subject to court \napproval, will serve four months in prison'' for price-fixing, \nKlein said. \n\n\n\tAnother three Hoffmann-LaRoche executives and four from BASF  \nwere not given immunity under the agreements reached Thursday, and \nadditional prosecutions are possible, said Gary R. Spratling, \ndeputy assistant attorney general in charge of criminal antitrust \nenforcement. \n\n\n\tThe case was broken open when another conspirator,  \nRhone-Poulenc, SA, a French pharmaceutical company, began \ncooperating with Justice investigators several months ago, \nSpratling said. ``The information provided by Rhone Poulenc was \nwhat the division needed.'' \n\n\n\tRhone-Poulenc was accepted into the antitrust division's  \nleniency program, which protects companies from criminal \nprosecution if they voluntarily report their involvement in a crime \nbefore prosecutors learn of their role. \n\n\n\tBut all the companies still could face private class-action  \nlawsuits from victims of the scheme. Private lawyers already have \nmet to discuss such lawsuits. \n\n\n\tRhone-Poulenc said its animal nutrition division ``acknowledged  \nthere were instances in the past in which the company's global \nbusiness practices did not meet U.S. legal standards,'' but said \nchanges have been made ``to ensure compliance.'' \n\n\n\tJustice officials said the attempted cover-up was a factor in  \nthe larger fine for Hoffmann-LaRoche. In addition, Hoffmann-LaRoche \nwas a repeat offender, Klein said -- caught earlier by the antitrust \ndivision in a global cartel that raised prices for the food \nadditive and feed additive citric acid. \n\n\n\t``",

(AP) -- Tyson Foods and more than a half-dozen  \nother U.S. poultry producers filed a federal lawsuit alleging a \nworldwide conspiracy among vitamin producers to fix prices for a \npopular animal-feed supplement. \n\n\n\tThe lawsuit makes claims similar to those in a federal criminal  \ncase that resulted in a multimillion dollar settlement last week. \nIt seeks to recover threefold the wrongful costs incurred by \npoultry producers, but does not list a dollar amount. \n\n\n\t``We believe we are the largest consumer of choline cloride in  \nNorth America. As far as the actual amount we're out, we believe it \nis significant,'' Tyson general counsel Les R. Baledge said today. \nHe declined to give a damage estimate. \n\n\n\tThe lawsuit, filed Tuesday in Fayetteville, alleges that  \nGermany's BASF AG and other companies engaged in a 10-year \nconspiracy to fix, raise and stabilize the price of choline, \ncommonly known as vitamin B4, and to divide up the world market \nshare. \n\n\n\tCholine is one of a number of vitamins essential to the diets of  \npoultry. It assists in the transportation of fat from the liver and \nalso affects certain nerve functions. \n\n\n\tBASF agreed last week to plead guilty and pay $225 million in  \nfines for a worldwide price-fixing scheme involving vitamins A, B2, \nB5, C, E and Beta Carotene. Swiss pharmaceutical giant F. \nHoffman-LaRoche Ltd., also agreed to plead guilty and pay a $500 \nmillion fine. \n\n\n\tIn March, Swiss vitamin manufacturer Lonza AG and five U.S.  \nexecutives also agreed to plead guilty in a worldwide vitamin \nprice-fixing conspiracy. Lonza, which is to pay a $10.5 million \nfine, was charged in a scheme for vitamin B3. The five executives \nwere charged with plotting to fix prices and allocate customers and \nsales of vitamin B4. \n\n\n\t``This is the civil side of the justice department's criminal  \nindictment,'' said Fayetteville lawyer John Elrod, representing \npoultry producers Simmons Food Inc. and Peterson Farms Inc. ``We're \ntracking on the civil side on behalf of the people who lost \nmoney.'' \n\n\n\tThe lawsuit contends a conspiracy existed from at least January  \n1988 through September 1998 among companies involved in producing \nand distributing the food supplement. \n\n\n\tThe lawsuit alleges that the companies agreed to allocate  \ncustomers, then either refrained from submitting bids or submitted \ncollusive, non-competitive or rigged bids to supply choline. \n\n\n\t``The intended result of this conduct was to leave the customer  \nwith only one non-competitive bid from which to choose, and to \nforce the customer to purchase choline at the seller's inflated \nprice,'' according to the lawsuit. \n\n\n\tAs a result of the conspiracy, the price of choline was 60 to  \n100 percent higher than the prices before and after the conspiracy, \nthe lawsuit said. \n\n\n\tThe lawsuit contends that the North American market was divided  \nand allocated to Bioproducts Inc. of Akron, Ohio; Highland, \nIll.-based DuCoa, which was a partnership operated by E.I.

They said that part of the price-fixing arrangement lasted\nnearly a decade. Six of the 13 companies have agreed to plead\nguilty and cooperate with the investigation, prosecutors said.

      "content": "EVIDENCE EMERGES ON INQUIRY INVOLVING ARCHER DANIELS \n\n\n\n   After more than three years of being shrouded in secrecy,\nevidence from the government's investigation of a huge price-fixing\nconspiracy involving Archer Daniels Midland Co. is emerging as the\nfirst criminal case stemming from the inquiry heads to trial.\n\n\n   The evidence, referenced in government records filed with the\nU.S. District Court in Chicago, portrayed the conspiracy between\nArcher Daniels and foreign competitors to fix prices of a feed\nadditive as a complex, often frustrating effort that involved\nseveral of the company's most senior officers.\n\n\n   During the efforts to hammer out a deal, according to the\ngovernment documents, competitors were invited to Decatur, Ill.,\nfor a lunch at Archer Daniels.\n\n\n   Senior officers then provided the competitors with a tour of its\nplant to impress upon them the company's ability to manufacture\nmass quantities of the additive lysine. That would decrease the\nworldwide price of lysine, cutting into all the companies' profits.\n\n\n   Jury selection began Thursday in the criminal case against three\nformer Archer Daniels executives _ Michael D. Andreas, who is now\non leave as the vice chairman of the company, Terrance S. Wilson,\nthe former head of its corn processing division, and Mark E.\nWhitacre, the former head of its bioproducts division. Opening\narguments are expected next week.\n\n\n   But records filed recently by the government lay out a blueprint\nof the prosecution's case, with a description of some evidence and\na detailed chronology of the events leading up to the federal raid\nof Archer Daniels in 1995.\n\n\n   Chief among the evidence described were recordings made by\nWhitacre, who worked for more than two years as a government\ninformant. Whitacre first alerted the government to the conspiracy\nin November 1992 and was offered immunity for his role as part of a\ncooperation pact. But prosecutors withdrew his immunity after\nlearning that Whitacre had illegally taken millions of dollars from\nArcher Daniels while working on the case.\n\n\n   In pretrial hearings, lawyers for Wilson and Andreas have made\nclear that they intend to attack the government's inquiry as shoddy\nand Whitacre as an out-of-control informant. They contended that\nWhitacre set up their clients, and that no price-fixing ever\nactually occurred. Lawyers for both men did not return calls\nThursday.\n\n\n   But the most compelling evidence described comes from the tapes.\nNumerous conversations, at times laced with obscenities, portrayed\nWilson as being intricately involved in the pricing scheme. At\ntimes, he was described as telling competitors that if they tried\nto compete on price, Archer Daniels would increase its production\nof lysine.\n\n\n   ``If we start losing business because of price,'' he was quoted\nas telling a competitor, ``then we will change our mind and do what\nwe have to do.''\n\n\n   Frequently, Andreas, the son of the company's chairman, Dwayne\nAndreas, was portrayed as an important strategist in the scheme.\nThe documents described repeated briefings of Andreas by Whitacre\non the progress of the scheme. During a briefing about one meeting\nwith competitors, Whitacre mentioned to Andreas that prices were\nrising slowly, to 85 cents a pound. ``Did you mention the idea that\nyou might take it up another nickel?'' Andreas asked.\n\n\n   At another meeting, Andreas was quoted as expressing frustration\nabout talks with competitors to control production levels. ``We got\nto start vocalizing our displeasure with volume,'' he was quoted as\nsaying, adding that Archer Daniels had to tell competitors that\nthey ``promised us we'd have our share if we backed off to the\nlevels we talked about.''\n\n\n   Other executives who have not been indicted in the case were\nalso portrayed as being aware of the scheme. For example, James\nRandall, the former president of Archer Daniels, was described as\nhaving attended the tour of the Archer Daniels plant with\ncompetitors, during which the benefits of price fixing were\ndiscussed by Wilson. That conversation was not recorded.\n\n\n   Jeff Col",

(AP) -- A federal class-action lawsuit has  \nbeen filed against Nine West Group and several large department \nstore chains, claiming they kept prices artificially high for years \non 12 brands of women's shoes. \n\n\n\tThe suit claims that Nine West enforced the price list by  \nthreatening to cut off supplies to any retailer who didn't toe the \nline. Violations were reported to the company by ``agents'' from \nthe stores, who spied on each other. \n\n\n\t``The defendants sold millions of pairs of Nine West footwear,  \nat prices inflated by the illegal price-fixing conspiracy,'' \naccording to the lawsuit, filed last week in White Plains, where \nNine West is headquartered. \n\n\n\tJoshua Rubin, lawyer for the plaintiffs, is asking federal Judge  \nBarrington Parker to certify the lawsuit as a class action on \nbehalf of anyone who bought, or considered buying, Nine West models \nthat were on the alleged price-fixing lists between 1988 and the \npresent. \n\n\n\tIt seeks unspecified damages, plus an injunction against  \nprice-fixing agreements. \n\n\n\tNine West is also under investigation by the Federal Trade  \nCommission for price-fixing allegations. \n\n\n\t``The law prohibits you from telling a retailer how to market  \nhis goods. You can't tell a retailer not to lower his price,'' said \nLarry Schulsinger, a partner at the retail consulting firm \nManagement Ventures Inc. \n\n\n\t``But manufacturers know that price-cutting hurts the value of  \nbrand, and they have reasons to want their brand to continue to \ncommand strong prices.'' \n\n\n\tCalls to Nine West were referred to Chief Financial Officer Bob  \nGalvin, who did not return them. \n\n\n\tNine West, which makes such popular brands as Enzo Angiolini,  \nBandolino, Easy Spirit, Calvin Klein, Westies and Pappagallo, fits \ninto a niche between designer shoes and discount shoes with prices \ngenerally between $50 and $90. \n\n\n\tIt claims one-fifth of all the shoes sold to women in America.  \nIts shoes are sold primarily in department stores, company-owned \nretail outlets and independent shoe stores. \n\n\n\tAccording to the suit, Nine West's top management meets at least  \nfour times a year with high-ranking representatives of the \nretailers that buy their shoes. Minimum prices -- and time periods \nduring which the prices will be enforced -- are agreed upon for the \nvarious brands and models, the suit says. \n\n\n\tAfterward, it says, ``The department stores and Nine West each  \nmonitor the retail prices charged ... by sending agents into other \nretailers' stores.'' \n\n\n\t``Each department store reports to Nine West whenever it learns  \nof any violation,'' the suit says, and then the company enforces \nthe restrictions ``by refusing to sell them its footwear products, \nby interfering with their advertising programs and by other \ncoercive retaliatory measures.'' \n\n\n\tStores named in the suit include Federated Department Stores  \nInc., which owns Macy's and Bloomingdale's, and May Department \nStores Co., which owns Lord &AMP; Taylor, Dillard's Inc., Dayton Hudson \nCorp. and Nordstrom Inc. \n\n\n\tFederated has denied involvement in price-fixing. May declined  \ncomment. Dayton Hudson did not return calls for comment. Officials \nat Dillard's could not be reached. \n\n\n\tNordstrom spokeswoman Brooke White said that the department  \nstore will contest the suit and plays ``no part in determining what \nvendors' suggested retail prices are.''",

In places like Riyadh and Moscow and Oslo and Mexico\nCity and Vienna -- where OPEC and other oil producers meet to set\noil prices -- the very notion of U.S. antitrust principles must be\ngood for a horse laugh.\n\n\n   Of the major categories of behavior covered by the antitrust\nlaws, alleged misuse of a legally acquired monopoly (the issue in\nthe Microsoft case) is the murkiest area. Right and wrong are only\nsomewhat clearer when the issue is corporate mergers.\n\n\n   On the one hand, when competitors merge it reduces competition.\nOn the other hand, there may be genuine efficiencies from the\ncombination that will benefit consumers. The one clear form of\nmisbehavior is price-fixing.\n\n\n   When competitors get together to fix prices or limit supply, you\nget the stifled competition with no compensating efficiency. The\nSherman Antitrust Act forbids ``every contract, combination ... or\nconspiracy in restraint of trade among the several States or with\nforeign nations.'' Price-fixing is illegal ``per se,'' meaning\nthere's no need to prove harm or any other complication. Violators\ncan and do go to prison.\n\n\n   The Justice Department's big price-fixing case of the moment\ninvolves Sotheby's and Christie's, the two big art auction houses.\nThe case seems to rest mainly on a suspicious pattern of one\ncompany raising its commissions and the other following a few weeks\nlater. (It's not even clear what's so suspicious about this. Even\nin competitive markets, rivals end up charging the same price when\nthey sell the same products or services.) The investigation has\nbeen going on since 1997, and no charges have been brought, but the\nheads of both firms have been forced to resign. Thank you, Uncle\nSam, for your vigilance in protecting rich art collectors from\nexcessive fees.\n\n\n   Meanwhile, in Vienna, a price-fixing conspiracy of textbook\npurity, involving a commodity that affects everyone, went on\nunmolested. Strolling in and out of meetings, the conspirators\ntalked to reporters like coaches at halftime of a sports event. The\noil minister of the United Arab Emirates told The New York Times,\n``We have not discussed all the possibilities and all the\noptions.''\n\n\n   The Algerian oil minister says, ``I worry about a decline in\ndemand,'' but adds, ``If there is a consensus, we will support\nit.''\n\n\n   What went on in Vienna is flatly felonious behavior that is\nlifting billions of dollars from the pockets of American citizens.\nIt may be beyond the reach of conventional antitrust enforcement,\nbut it is not beyond all American discipline. If these oil\nministers were bank robbers (``No, we haven't yet decided whether\nto go for Chase Manhattan or Commerce Bank of Kansas City ...''),\nthe government would do more than send a Cabinet secretary like\nEnergy Secretary Bill Richardson to plead for moderation. (``Look,\nwhy not just take out a couple of suburban branches?'')\n\n\n   Under the law, it makes no difference if a price-fixing\nconspiracy attempts to raise prices or lower them and whether it\nsucceeds or fails. Raising prices too high can be self-defeating:\nYou get more per barrel, but you sell fewer barrels. If OPEC lowers\nprices, it does so in search of the ``sweet spot'' where long-term\nrevenue is maximized. There is no win-win here: The interests of\nthe price-fixers and the interests of consumers are directly\nopposite.\n\n\n   So, Republicans are right to criticize the Clinton\nadministration for being lackadaisical in its response to the\nlatest oil heist.

In this\ncase, that formula did not work to the best interest of the\ninformant, Mark Whitacre.\n\n\n   But it also is partly the result of one finding by Judge Blanche\nManning during the sentencing hearing that has left legal experts\nperplexed. She determined that Whitacre was a manager of the\nconspiracy _ and thus liable to heavier penalties _ even though he\nwas outranked by at least one of his co-defendants, whom she found\nto have no managerial role.\n\n\n   ``I don't understand how it's possible,'' said John C. Coffee\nJr., a professor at Columbia University Law School. ``I'm just\ntrying to think of any shred of an explanation.''\n\n\n   Some legal experts said that the outcomes in the Archer Daniels\ncase underscored how the sentencing guidelines _ so often\ncriticized by judges as a straitjacket binding them to particular\noutcomes _ can, in certain cases, be about as restrictive as a\nsport coat.\n\n\n   In the case, the judge sentenced two executives, Michael Andreas\nand Terrance Wilson, to the same sentence: two years in prison and\na $350,000 fine. Andreas, the company's former vice chairman, and\nWilson, the former head of corn processing, were chief targets of\nthe criminal investigation almost from its opening days in 1992.\n\n\n   Whitacre was sentenced to two and a half years in prison even\nthough, just a few months after the price-fixing conspiracy began,\nhe brought the matter to the attention of the government. For years\nafterward, he worked as a government informant in the case,\nsecretly tape-recording his colleagues and competitors as they met\nto fix prices.\n\n\n   But Whitacre brought many of his troubles on himself. Soon after\nraids on Archer Daniels in 1995, Whitacre was discredited as a\nwitness and eventually lost his immunity from prosecution, when it\nwas disclosed that he had been illegally taking millions of dollars\nfrom the company, even while working as an informant.\n\n\n   That alone helped to account for some part of the odd outcome in\nthe price-fixing sentence. In 1997, Whitacre pleaded guilty to\nfraud charges and was already serving a nine-year sentence. As a\nresult, under the sentencing guideline calculations, Whitacre would\nbe treated as a repeat offender _ a designation that automatically\npumps up the possible sentences under the guidelines.\n\n\n   Then, by ruling that Whitacre was a manager in the conspiracy,\nwhile his co-defendants were not, the judge increased Whitacre's\n``offense level'' to the highest of any of the executives.\n\n\n   The ruling stumped legal experts. ``She's taking a very, very\nbizarre view of the word manager,'' said Gerald Lefcourt, a\nprominent defense lawyer in New York City. ``The vice chairman is\nat the higher level of the conspiracy. Not to give him a managerial\nrole and to give it to someone who carried out the price fixing is\npretty silly.''\n\n\n   Prosecutors in the case said that they could not explain the\nruling. But they pointed out that Whitacre's lawyer did not object\nto his designation as a manager, while lawyers for both Andreas and\nWilson did.\n\n\n   A clerk said that the judge would have no comment on her\nsentencing but would be issuing a written opinion on the case in\nthe next few days.\n\n\n   While that portion of the ruling struck legal experts as odd, in\nthe end it seemed to have made no difference to the actual time in\nprison Whitacre will serve. Only 20 months of Whitacre's new\nsentence will be on top of his current term, with the additional 10\nmonths served concurrently. In other words, the amount of",

Cox, told federal\nofficials that in the early 1990s he had spoken more than a dozen\ntimes with the Cargill executive, William M. Gruber, ``about what\neach would be bidding on specific accounts'' in the sale of citric\nacid to giant food and consumer product companies. Citric acid is\nan additive used in everything from soft drinks to detergents.\n\n\n   According to records of two interviews in 1996 and 1997, which\nwere recently made public as part of a related criminal case, Cox\ntold investigators that he believed Gruber, formerly the head of\nnational sales of citric acid at Cargill, might have been acting\nwithout the knowledge of other Cargill officials.\n\n\n   Government prosecutors have said that Cargill did not take part\nwith Archer Daniels and three other companies _ the Haarmann &AMP;\nReimer Corp. of Springfield, N.J., Hoffman-LaRoche Inc., a division\nof Roche Holdings in Switzerland and Jungbunzlauer Inc. of Austria\n_ in a much broader international conspiracy. That scheme involved\nregular meetings in the early 1990s to illegally fix prices in the\ncitric acid market. The four companies eventually paid more than\n$100 million to settle government charges of illegal price-fixing.\n\n\n   The Justice Department said last week that it was not\ninvestigating Cargill or Gruber at this time.\n\n\n   The Cox statements could play a significant role in an appeal of\na class-action suit against Cargill, filed by purchasers of citric\nacid who claim they were cheated by the company. Earlier this week,\nlawyers for the purchasers filed a motion citing the Cox statements\nas grounds for overturning a dismissal of the case for lack of\nevidence.\n\n\n   Cox said in interviews with federal prosecutors that between\n1992 and 1995 he and Gruber worked together to rig bids on the sale\nof citric acid to giant U.S. companies. The interviews were\nconducted under a federal order that granted Cox immunity but did\nnot shield him from criminal prosecution for making false or\nmisleading statements.\n\n\n   Cargill officials vehemently denied any suggestion that the\ncompany or Gruber took part in bid rigging or price-fixing. Richard\nJ. Favretto, an attorney for Cargill, called Cox's statements\n``wholly unsubstantiated'' and said that after a thorough,\nfour-year investigation of the citric acid market, the Justice\nDepartment had taken no action against Cargill or any of its\nemployees. Cargill officials said Gruber declined to comment.\n\n\n   Cargill also released a letter it secured upon request last week\nfrom Phillip H. Warren, assistant chief of the Justice Department's\nantitrust division, which said that ``Cargill Inc. and William M.\nGruber are neither targets of, nor currently under investigation\nin, the antitrust division's investigation of possible criminal\nantitrust violations in the citric acid industry.''\n\n\n   Justice Department officials confirmed that they had sent the\nletter but declined to elaborate.\n\n\n   Archer Daniels, Cargill and the three other makers of citric\nacid were also accused in the class-action suit of conspiring to\nfix the price of citric acid. Cox told investigators that he and\nGruber discussed the bids for Coca-Cola, Mars, Procter &AMP; Gamble and\nPhillip Morris' Kraft Foods division. Coca-Cola and Mars are part\nof the class-action suit.

He is at a  \nfederal prison camp in Edgefield, S.C., serving a nine-year \nsentence for swindling ADM out of $9 million. \n\n\n\tHe and two other top ADM executives -- Michael Andreas and  \nTerrance Wilson -- were convicted in September 1998 of conspiring to \nfix the $600 million world market in lysine, a soybean-based \nadditive that promotes growth in hogs and poultry. \n\n\n\tWhitacre originally went undercover and wore a wire for  \ninvestigators but later broke with them and was accused of taking \npart in the crime he had helped to investigate. \n\n\n\t``They would have no case without me, against ADM and its  \nexecutives,'' said Whitacre in court over the phone. ``I risked my \nlife and my career for them, and I have yet to see anything.'' \n\n\n\tU.S. District Judge Blanche Manning made 10 months in his term  \nconcurrent with the term he is serving, with the additional 20 \nmonths to be served in addition. She also ordered him to \nparticipate in a mental health treatment program after his release. \n\n\n\tManning also heard arguments today from attorneys for Andreas  \nand Wilson the length of their sentences. \n\n\n\tA U.S. District Court jury convicted the three men of one count  \nof conspiring with Japanese and Korean rivals to fix the price of \nlysine and limit its production -- a criminal antitrust violation. \n\n\n\tAndreas, 49, is the son of ADM chairman emeritus Dwayne Andreas,  \nwho in the 1960s built the company into a global agribusiness \nempire. At one point, Michael Andreas was considered heir to the \ntop spot within ADM. \n\n\n\tWilson, 60, is the retired head of ADM's big corn division.  \n\n\n\tWhitacre was brought to ADM as chief of its bioproducts division  \nto lead the company into the lucrative lysine market. Producing the \nsoybean-based product requires a sophisticated technical know-how \nthat he claimed to have. \n\n\n\tIt was Whitacre who inadvertently launched the FBI investigation  \nof the food-processing giant based in Decatur by claiming Japanese \nrivals were sabotaging ADM's move into the $600 million lysine \nmarket. \n\n\n\tWhitacre asked top ADM executives for $10 million to buy off  \n``Mr. Fujiwara,'' the supposed leader of the saboteurs. Instead, \ncompany officials called in federal investigators. \n\n\n\tFBI agents could find no trace of sabotage. When FBI agents  \nasked him about his claim, Whitacre instead told them about a \nconspiracy between ADM and rival companies to fix the price of \nlysine. \n\n\n\tWhitacre wore a hidden microphone to gather evidence against his  \nfellow ADM executives. Prosecutors say the tapes show ``a ruthless \ncampaign to make its competitors its friends and treat its \ncustomers as enemies.'' \n\n\n\tAndreas attorneys insisted that the tapes contained nothing to  \nshow that their client had taken part in a price-fixing conspiracy. \n\n\n\tAttorneys for the Wilson, who is heard on tape discussing lysine  \nprices with ADM rivals, argued that he was merely playing along \nwith Asian manufacturers as they hatched a conspiracy.",

For a full decade,\ntop executives at some of the world's largest drug companies met\nsecretly in hotel suites and at conferences. When federal\ninvestigators were closing in, they moved to the homes of\nhigh-level European executives.\n\n\n   Working together in a coalition they brazenly called ``Vitamins\nInc.,'' they carved up world markets and carefully orchestrated\nprice increases, in the process defrauding some of the world's\nbiggest food companies, including Kellogg, Coca-Cola and Nestle.\n\n\n   It was, in the words of Joel I. Klein, head of the Justice\nDepartment's antitrust division, ``the most pervasive and harmful\ncriminal antitrust conspiracy ever uncovered.''\n\n\n   In May, after the conspiracy collapsed, those involved agreed to\npay nearly $1 billion to settle federal antitrust charges, by far\nthe largest criminal fines in American history. Further penalties\ncould come in Europe and elsewhere. The companies involved have\npleaded guilty to the government's charges, but they have refused\nto discuss details of the case beyond what the authorities\noriginally charged.\n\n\n   Now, virtually every big vitamin maker in the world is on the\nbrink of agreeing to pay an additional $1.1 billion to resolve a\nconsolidated class-action suit brought by purchasers of bulk\nvitamins _ the raw vitamin ingredients that go into everything from\ncereal and orange juice to vitamin pills and chicken feed. The suit\nalleges a wide variety of anti-competitive practices.\n\n\n   How could a conspiracy on this scale ever be born, much less\nsurvive a decade? How, in a global marketplace filled with\nsophisticated buyers and sellers, could a group of multinational\ncorporations, largely from Europe and Asia, avoid detection for so\nlong?\n\n\n   They did it, interviews with investigators and a review of court\ndocuments show, with a sly mixture of corporate panache and tight\ndiscipline _ nourished by a European tradition that encouraged such\nanti-competitive practices. The big vitamin makers aren't talking,\nexcept to say that they regret fixing prices and are working to\nkeep it from happening again.\n\n\n   ``We can't dispute the facts and we've decided it is of no value\nto unravel it. The situation is behind us,'' said Carolyn R. Glynn,\na spokeswoman at &UR;  &LR; Roche AG, which is based in Basel, Switzerland.\n``We've paid dearly for it.''\n\n\n   But even lacking chapter-and-verse corporate confessions, it is\nstill possible to piece together the outlines of this historic\nswindle.\n\n\n   It all began in 1989, when executives at Roche and BASF AG of\nGermany began holding secret talks about price-fixing, government\ninvestigators said. At the time, both companies faced pressure from\nrivals and from the prospect of falling prices.\n\n\n   Their solution was to agree, in secret, to carve up the vitamin\nmarket and to recruit other big vitamin makers to come in on the\narrangement, like Rhone-Poulenc of France and Takeda Chemical\nIndustries, Japan's largest pharmaceutical company. Because these\ncompanies have operations in the United States, this was a blatant\nviolation of the Sherman Antitrust Act.\n\n\n   ``These companies seemed to be indifferent to the possibility\nthat the antitrust laws would be enforced,'' said Robert Silver, a\nlawyer at Boies &AMP; Schiller, of Armonk, N.Y., who filed the first\nclass-action suit against the vitamin makers in 1998.\n\n\n   Roche was the ringleader. Its executives, federal investigators\nsay, organized the meetings, coordinated the price-fixing and\nordered documents destroyed. It wasn't just one Roche officer but a\nsuccession of high-level executives who carried out the details of\nthe plot.\n\n\n   The company had gone this route before. Roche's antitrust\nproblems date to the early 1970s, when it was fined by antitrust\nofficials in Europe for engaging in anticompetitive behavior in the\nsale of two tranquilizers, Librium and Valium.\n\n\n   Roche also faced litigation over the vitamin market in 1973\nafter Stanley Adams, a high-level executive in its vitam",

Klein.\n\n\n\t   In a statement, Mitsubishi denied the charges and said it would \"vigorously\ndefend against those charges in court.\"\n\n\n\t   \"Specifically, we deny aiding and abetting UCAR International Inc. ... or\nanyone else to engage in any unlawful conduct,\" said the statement released by\nattorneys Kekst and Co. \"We look forward to presenting our case in federal\ndistrict court in Philadelphia, and to clearing our good name.\"\n\n\n\t   Formerly based in Danbury, Conn., UCAR recently moved its headquarters to\nNashville. Company spokesman Joel Hawthorne said UCAR did not want to comment on\nthe suit because it did not involve the company itself, which had agreed to\nplead guilty in April 1998 and paid a then-record $110 million fine for the same\nconspiracy.\n\n\n\t   Since then, SGL Carbon AG, a German corporation, was sentenced to pay a $135\nmillion fine in the case. Two former UCAR executives have agreed to plead guilty\nand serve time in prison. SGL's chief executive, Robert J.

Humer, the chief executive. ``It is\ncertainly not easy to understand the reasons for actions of\nemployees who in secrecy organized a conspiracy of this kind.''\n\n\n   Roche, a pharmaceutical conglomerate based here, was by far the\nbiggest player in what the U.S. Justice Department has described as\na sophisticated cartel to fix worldwide vitamin prices as much as\n25 percent above the market level.\n\n\n   On Thursday, Roche agree to pay $500 million to settle charges\nwith the Justice Department. Two of its top executives resigned,\nand one of them agreed to serve a four-month prison sentence in the\nUnited States.\n\n\n   Friday, at a news conference at company headquarters, both the\nchairman and the chief executive were almost completely at a loss\nto explain how the wrongdoing could have happened _ or what they\nwould do to keep it from happening again.\n\n\n   To be sure, Roche was not alone. BASF AG of Germany agreed to\nsettle similar charges by paying $225 million in fines.\nRhone-Poulenc &UR;  &LR; of France, which was also part of the cartel but\nprovided crucial information to prosecutors, was allowed to escape\npunishment.\n\n\n   But Roche was the undisputed heavyweight, controlling about 40\npercent of the worldwide vitamin market. It also had a history of\nprice fixing: in 1997, the same division that was implicated\nThursday had to pay a $14 million fine for its involvement in\nfixing the price of citric acid and lysine, which are food\nadditives.\n\n\n   The potential liabilities of Roche and BASF were clearly on the\nminds of investors. Roche shares fell 330 Swiss francs, or nearly 2\npercent, to close at 16,670. BASF was down 0.05 euros, to 39.25,\nwhile Rhone-Poulenc was up 1.44 euros, to 48.39.\n\n\n   What makes the Roche case most remarkable is that the executives\nembroiled in the last round of price-fixing were apparently\ninvolved in the latest one as well _ even as Roche was vowing to\nclean up its practices.\n\n\n   Friday, Humer attributed the wrongdoing to what he called the\nsecret machinations of the implicated executives. He insisted that\nthe company had ``never tolerated practices of this kind.'' He\nvowed to start a ``vigorous information campaign'' that would tell\nall employees about ethical practices.\n\n\n   But even as they promised to restore Roche's credibility with\nits corporate customers _ a number of whom have filed suit _ the\nRoche executives could not explain what had happened or why.\n\n\n   ``We don't really know what they did,'' Fritz Gerber, Roche's\nchairman, said. The problem, he said, was that the most important\nsource of information was the Justice Department and that Roche did\nnot have access to the government's evidence.\n\n\n   ``It is clear that there was an elaborate conspiracy that was\nkept entirely secret by a small group of employees,'' Humer said.\nBut, he said, ``we are very reliant on what the Justice Department\nhas published.''\n\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n\n   By all accounts, the conspiracy was sophisticated and global.\nRoche, BASF and Rhone-Poulenc control more than 80 percent of the\nworld vitamin market.\n\n\n   The three companies have admitted forming a cartel in 1990 that\nlasted until this year and that included most of the world's\nsmaller producers.\n\n\n   In its indictment, the Justice Department said that executives\nfrom the companies met secretly to set prices and carve up the\nmarket. According to the government, the conspiracy involved people\nat many levels of management and was operated with the smoothness\nof a single company _ ``Vitamins Inc.,'' in one government\ncharacterization.\n\n\n   The big question Friday was how Roche, which had already run\nafoul of the Justice Departme",

Because Rhone-Poulenc cooperated in the\nearly days of the government's investigation, the company avoided\npaying a large sanction.\n\n\n   In securing a settlement last month, government antitrust\nofficials said the decade-long conspiracy affected virtually every\nAmerican household. The vitamin conspirators, who met regularly and\nsometimes referred to themselves as ``Vitamins Inc.,'' fraudulently\ninflated the prices of bulk vitamins that went into everything from\nbreakfast milk and cereal to orange juice, meats, pet food and even\none-a-day vitamins. The vitamins affected were vitamin A, B2, B5,\nC, E and Beta Carotene.\n\n\n   According to people who have been briefed on the negotiations,\nthe three companies _ which dominate the world's vitamins market _\nare eager to end the case, and a settlement is expected to come in\nthe next week or two. Roche is expected to pay the bulk of the\nproposed settlement, up to $500 million, with BASF paying about\n$250 million and Rhone-Poulenc paying about $85 million. The\nclass-action suit is primarily focused on vitamins A, C and E and\nthe proposed settlement is largely determined by market share.\n\n\n   Among the dozens of plaintiffs in the suit are animal feed\nsuppliers, food processors and farmers. One of the earliest\nlawsuits was filed by the J&AMP;R Feed Services, in Cullman, Ala., in\n1997.\n\n\n   If a settlement is agreed to, and people close to the\nnegotiations say the talks could still break down, that would mean\nthat altogether, Roche would have agreed to pay more than $1\nbillion to settle charges that company executives worked in concert\nwith executives at the other major vitamin makers to allocate\nmarkets and fix the prices of human and animal vitamins, thereby\novercharging American farmers and food processors as well as\nconsumers.\n\n\n   In all, the three drug companies, which control as much as 90\npercent of the market for the most popular vitamins, would be\nsaddled with fines of more than $1.5 billion; the companies also\nexpect to face antitrust litigation, scrutiny or sanctions in\nCanada and Europe.\n\n\n   Officials at Roche, which is based in Basel, Switzerland, BASF,\nwhich is based in Germany and Rhone-Poulenc, which is headquartered\nin France, were unavailable for comment.\n\n\n   Lawyers with Boies &AMP; Schiller, the Washington law firm that is\nleading the class-action settlement, declined comment.\n\n\n   A person close to the negotiations, however, said that the\nsettlement talks are moving ahead, and the discussion is\n``primarily about the money.''\n\n\n   In the Justice Department settlement, Roche paid $500 million\nand BASF paid $225 million to settle the case. A former Roche\nofficial, a Swiss citizen who headed the vitamins division, also\nagreed to serve a four-month jail term in the United States, and\ngovernment investigators said that there could be more indictments.\n\n\n   A number of smaller vitamin manufacturers have also pled guilty\nto fixing prices in the market, and Federal investigators say they\nare continuing to investigate what they say was an illegal\ninternational cartel that operated in the vitamins market.\n\n\n   All three companies have said that they have been cooperating\nwith Justice Department officials and publicly hinted that they had\nbeen seeking to settle the class-action lawsuits.

      "content": "&HT;   \n\n\n\n   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ It happens every spring.\n\n\n   Passover comes, the price of kosher-for-Passover matzo soars in\nSouth Florida compared with metro New York and other areas. Angry\nconsumers complain the fix is in.\n\n\n   But an 18-month investigation by Florida Attorney General Bob\nButterworth into Passover matzo manufacturing, distributing and\nretailing refutes the conspiracy theory. The report says a regional\nprice-fixing scheme doesn't make much sense because it would be\njust as easy _ and more profitable _ to do it nationally.\n\n\n   Passover matzo is the unleavened bread traditionally eaten at\nthe Jewish holiday to commemorate the deliverance of the ancient\nHebrews from slavery in Egypt. Seemingly every year, South Florida\ngrocers sell Passover matzo at prices two or three times the price\nin other metropolitan areas with large Jewish populations.\n\n\n   Two years ago, angry constituents contacted U.S. Rep. Robert\nWexler (D-Boca Raton), who in turn asked Butterworth to\ninvestigate. The issue even spawned a lawsuit in Palm Beach County\nCircuit Court that charged the two domestic matzo manufacturers,\nManischewitz Co. LLC and Aron Streit Inc., with collusion.\n\n\n   Butterworth's report illustrated the problem this way: During\nthe 1997 Passover season, a 5-pound box of Manischewitz Passover\nmatzo sold for $11.99 at Publix supermarkets in South Florida but\nsold for only $3.99 at the Ralph's grocery chain in Los Angeles.\nSimilar discrepancies occur ever year in New York and New Jersey.\n\n\n   But the difference, according to Butterworth, can be explained\nby competition. Grocery stores in other areas use Passover matzo as\na loss leader, an item sold below cost to draw customers into the\nstores.\n\n\n   Still, South Florida grocers say they're not making money on the\nitem.\n\n\n   ``We're not charging more than what we pay,'' said Carmen\nMillares, community affairs manager for the Miami division of\nPublix. ``Actually, we're losing money.''\n\n\n   Publix has Passover matzo on special, charging $9.99 for a\n5-pound box.\n\n\n   The conspiracy theory went nowhere in court either. In 1997,\nPalm Beach County resident Sylvia Confino sued Manischewitz and\nAron Streit alleging they fixed Passover matzo prices.\n\n\n   Less than four months after filing the suit, Confino withdrew\nit.\n\n\n   ``They convinced us that it would be exceedingly difficult for\nus to show there was a conspiracy,'' said Boca Raton attorney Paul\nGeller, who represented Confino.\n\n\n   Said Jeffrey Weissman, a Fort Lauderdale attorney who\nrepresented Aron Streit: ``They brought it on a wing and a prayer,\nand no facts. It's closed. As far as we're concerned, it wasn't\nworth opening.''\n\n\n   Still, there are skeptics out there who believe something is\namiss somewhere. West Palm Beach residents Harold and Shirley\nMorgenstern are among them, pointing to an ad from a New Jersey\nnewspaper showing matzo and other Passover fare priced well below\nwhat the same items sell for in South Florida stores.\n\n\n   ``I could see a couple of cents difference,'' Shirley\nMorgenstern said. ``They have to make a profit in New Jersey just\nas they do here. I really don't buy it.''\n\n\n   Story Filed By Cox Newspapers\n\n\n   For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service",

Andreas, son of longtime ADM chief Dwayne \nAndreas, and Wilson were convicted last September. \n\n\n\tIn seeking the $25 million fines, as well as prison time for  \nAndreas, prosecutors said such punishment would reflect the amount \nof money ADM allegedly reaped in the scheme. \n\n\n\tBut U.S. District Judge Blanche Manning berated the Justice  \nDepartment in a ruling Wednesday, saying it failed to prove how \nmuch lysine sales were affected by the scheme. \n\n\n\tThe defendants had said a $25 million fine was too high, given  \nthe amount of lysine produced in the world during the price-fixing \nscheme. They sought proof for their argument from overseas lysine \nproducers who allegedly participated in the price-fixing \nconspiracy. \n\n\n\tManning said the government wrote letters to the overseas  \nproducers ``informing them that they were not obliged to produce \ndocuments'' for Andreas and Wilson.

Exec To Plead Guilty \n\n\n\tWASHINGTON (AP) -- A former Swiss pharmaceutical company  \nexecutive agreed Thursday to plead guilty and serve six months in \njail for his role in a worldwide case of vitamin price-fixing, the \nJustice Department announced. \n\n\n\tThis was the 10th prosecution in the case in which the company,  \nF.

Vitamin premixes are used to \nenrich breakfast cereals and numerous other processed foods. \n\n\n\t``Bronnimann knew of, approved and participated in key aspects  \nof Hoffmann-La Roche's operation in the vitamins cartel,'' said \nGary R.

      "content": "DRUG MAKERS TENTATIVELY SETTLE IN PRICE-FIXING SUIT \n\n\n\n   In one of the United States' bitterest scuffles over fair trade,\nfour pharmaceutical companies have tentatively agreed to pay $345\nmillion to settle a class-action price-fixing lawsuit brought by\n40,000 retail pharmacies, according to lawyers involved in the\ncase.\n\n\n   Lawyers for Abbott Laboratories, Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn Inc., the\nHoechst Marion Roussel unit of Hoechst AG of Germany and\nRhone-Poulenc Rorer Inc. appeared Tuesday before U.S. District\nJudge Charles Kocoras in Chicago to present the proposed\nsettlement. Details of the agreement were not fully disclosed.\n\n\n   The pharmacies had contended in a number of lawsuits that were\nfiled in 1993, and eventually consolidated into one class-action\ncase, that large drug makers had conspired to develop a two-tier\npricing system during the early 1990s. The drug makers gave\ndiscounts to managed-care companies and health-maintenance\norganizations, the pharmacy owners said, while charging them higher\nprices.\n\n\n   Under the deal presented Tuesday, the drug makers agreed to\nrefrain from a two-tier pricing system, without admitting any\nliability, said lawyers involved in the agreement.\n\n\n   While Tuesday's proposed settlement moved the case one step\ncloser to completion, it remains far from over.\n\n\n   Two years ago, 11 pharmaceutical makers agreed to pay $351\nmillion to settle the price-fixing contentions, leaving eight\ndefendants in the case. After four more agreed to the proposed\nsettlement Tuesday, that left four big pharmaceutical companies _\nNovartis, Johnson &AMP; Johnson, the G.D. Searle unit of Monsanto and\nForest Laboratories _ to refute the pharmacies' contentions in a\ntrial before Kocoras, which is set to begin Sept. 14.\n\n\n   ``We are encouraged four drug manufacturers are joining others\nwho have previously agreed to settle a class-action lawsuit by\nretail community pharmacies over allegations of manufacturer\nprice-fixing,'' said Ronald L. Ziegler, the chief executive of the\nNational Association of Chain Drug Stores, an industry group in\nAlexandria, Va. ``Hopefully, all manufacturers will practice the\nterms of the settlement.''\n\n\n   Abbott Laboratories and Hoechst Marion Roussel declined to\ncomment Tuesday. Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn said in a statement that it had\nagreed to pay $102.5 million, a bit less than one-third of the\ntotal tentative settlement. As a result, the company said, it must\nincrease reserves by $61 million and take a $41 million after-tax\ncharge against earnings in the second quarter, which ended June 30.\n\n\n   John Abrams, a spokesman for Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, said Tuesday\nthat the amount the company had agreed to pay was ``substantially\nless'' than Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn's share. Rhone-Poulenc agreed to\nsettle, he said, to avoid the risks and uncertainty of litigation.\n\n\n   Tuesday's proposed settlement would bring the total settlement\namount to about $700 million, which will be held in escrow until\nthe case is completed. The pharmacy owners must determine how the\nmoney will be divided. Initially, the small pharmacy owners had\nwanted an equal split regardless of size, while proprietors of the\nlarger stores wanted a formula based on per-store drug sales\nvolume.\n\n\n   According to a lawyer involved in the negotiations, the two\ngroups are considering a plan that provides for a minimum payout\nwith additional money allotments based on drug sales.\n\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n\n   With Tuesday's tentative settlement, the drugstore owners\nappeared optimistic that they would win the antitrust trial,\nsinking their last four opponents. They may have reason to feel\nconfident, according to one lawyer involved in the agreement.\nDuring the pretrial phase of the case the pharmacies have uncovered\ndocuments that not only appear to confirm their accusations, but\nhave been aired publicly in court.\n\n\n   In April 1996, Kocoras quoted from documents that had been\npresented in the case and said it was ``unquestionable'' that the\ndrug companies ``had the opportunity to conspire.''

It seeks unspecified damages and to have the joint \nventures dissolved. \n\n\n\t``It's a straight, old-fashioned price-fixing agreement,'' said  \nJoseph Alioto, the attorney for 39 dealers named as plaintiffs in \nthe suit. \n\n\n\tDuring the past 18 months, the prices dealers have paid for gas  \nhave risen between 25 cents and 55 cents per gallon, said Tom \nBleau, co-counsel for the 39 dealers named as plaintiffs in the \nsuit. Over the same period, the price in the gasoline futures \nmarket has declined by more than 4 cents a gallon. \n\n\n\tRent increases have ranged from 30 percent to 100 percent, Bleau  \nsaid. An independent dealer rents a gas station location from an \noil company, but owns the business itself. \n\n\n\tThe three companies refine and market gasoline in the eastern  \nUnited States through Houston-based Motiva Enterprises LLC. \n\n\n\tTexaco and Shell refine and market in the West and Midwest  \nthrough a separate firm, Equilon Enterprises LLC, also based in \nHouston. Saudi Refining is not part of Equilon. \n\n\n\tA third company, Equiva Services, provides various services to  \nMotiva and Equilon. The three ventures also were named in the \nlawsuit. \n\n\n\t``The formation of Equilon, Motiva and Equiva was done for  \nlegitimate business reasons,'' said Andy Norman, a spokesman for \nTexaco. ``It was totally proper and the formation of those \ncompanies has led to a number of efficiencies in our ... \noperations.'' \n\n\n\tCreation of the ventures was the subject of an investigation by  \nthe Federal Trade Commission and attorney generals in several \nstates where the companies operate. No wrongdoing was found, Norman \nsaid. \n\n\n\tEquilon issued a statement calling the allegations preposterous.  \nCalls to the other defendants were not immediately returned. \n\n\n\tIn the suit, dealers contend their rents and prices were raised  \nsoon after the joint ventures began. As a result, they have had to \nsell gasoline at uncompetitive prices, they said. \n\n\n\tSmall stations, whether independent or company owned, have  \nstruggled to sell enough gasoline to stay open, but ``these are \nmarket forces. They're not collusion,'' said Bill Berman, publisher \nof The Pump Price Report, a weekly survey of gasoline prices and \nsupply. \n\n\n\t``They're not intentional efforts by the refiners or  \nwholesalers,'' he said. \n\n\n\tThe gas station business has grown increasingly difficult in  \nrecent years. The number of service stations in the United States \nhas dropped sharply during the past five years, from 202,800 to \n177,800, according to a survey by National Petroleum News, a trade \nmagazine. The survey did not include separate numbers for \nindependent dealers.",

Parker, director of the FTC's Bureau of\nCompetition.\n\n\n   Retailers who did not adhere to Nine West policies were\nthreatened with cancellations, denied orders or were not given\ndiscounts, officials said.\n\n\n   As a result, competition among retailers selling Nine West\nbrands was restricted and the price of the company's shoes were\nkept artificially high, the FTC's complaint said.\n\n\n   Officials with Nine West, based in White Plains, N.Y., said the\nsettlement was not an admission of liability.\n\n\n   ''We believe that this was the most efficient manner in which to\nresolve this issue, avoiding substantial legal expense and\nmanagement time,'' said Jacki Nemerov, president of Jones Apparel\nGroup, which acquired Nine West last summer. The alleged price\nfixing occurred from January 1988 to July 1999.\n\n\n   The company entered into two separate settlements, one with the\nattorneys general of the 50 states, the District of Columbia,\nPuerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Northern Mariana\nIslands and Guam. The other is with the FTC.\n\n\n   The FTC settlement prohibits Nine West from setting the price at\nwhich retailers can advertise, promote or sell shoes or coercing\nretailers to stick to any one price. The company also cannot notify\ndealers in advance that they are subject to suspension if they sell\nNine West shoes below a designated price. Nine West must also\nnotify its dealers that they have the right to set the price for\nthe company's products.\n\n\n   The agreement with the states requires a payment of $34 million.\nOf this, no more than $3.5 million will cover attorney's fees,\nwhile the rest will be used to fund women's health, educational,\nvocational and safety programs.\n\n\n   The settlement was filed in U.S. District Court in New York\nimmediately after a lawsuit was filed against Nine West in the same\ncourt. The agreement resolves the suit, but gives the court\njurisdiction over the terms of the settlement.\n\n\n   ''When even one business won't play by the rules and illegally\novercharges its customers, everybody gets hurts,'' said South\nCarolina Attorney General Charlie Condon. He is proposing that the\nstate use its portion of the money to assist rape victims and\ncrisis pregnancy centers.\n\n\n   ------\n\n\n   On the Net: Federal Trade Commission site: http://www.ftc.gov\n\n\n AP-ES-03-06-00 2229",

They were convicted in \nSeptember. \n\n\n\tMark Whitacre, 49, former head of ADM's bioproducts division,  \nwas sentenced to 30 months -- 20 of that to be served on top of a \nnine-year sentence he is currently serving for swindling ADM out of \n$9 million. \n\n\n\tWhitacre, who wore a wire as an undercover FBI informant at ADM  \nbut later fell out with the government, heard his sentence from a \nfederal prison camp in Edgefield, S.C. He waived his right to be in \ncourt. \n\n\n\t``Life in prison is actually better than life at ADM,'' the  \nOhio-born biochemist told the court. He bitterly denounced not only \nthe company but the FBI, saying, ``I risked my life and my career'' \nto help them. \n\n\n\tAs part of his sentence, Manning directed Whitacre to seek  \nmental health treatment once he is released from prison. His \nattorney, Bill Walker, says that he has bipolar disease and is on \nmedication. \n\n\n\tAndreas apologized to the court but stopped short of admitting  \nany wrongdoing. Andreas' and Wilson's attorneys said they would \nappeal. \n\n\n\t``I love this country, your honor, and I thought I knew its  \nrules,'' Andreas told Manning before he was sentenced. ``I did not \nwant to commit a crime, and I did not think that I had committed a \ncrime.'' \n\n\n\tProsecutors said the sentences should serve as a deterrent to  \nany would-be price fixers. \n\n\n\t``It's not the longest sentence ever imposed but it's a long  \nsentence under the antitrust guidelines,'' said Justice Department \nlawyer James Griffin. \n\n\n\tADM, based in Decatur, deep in central Illinois' corn and  \nsoybean country, has paid a $100 million fine and settled three \nantitrust lawsuits for an additional $90 million. \n\n\n\tAndreas and Wilson are to report to prison in September.",

Parker, director of the FTC's Bureau of\nCompetition.\n\n\n   Retailers who did not adhere to Nine West policies were\nthreatened with cancellations, denied orders or were not given\ndiscounts, officials said.\n\n\n   As a result, competition among retailers selling Nine West\nbrands was restricted and the price of the company's shoes were\nkept artificially high, the FTC's complaint said.\n\n\n   Officials with Nine West, based in White Plains, N.Y., said the\nsettlement was not an admission of liability.\n\n\n   ''We believe that this was the most efficient manner in which to\nresolve this issue, avoiding substantial legal expense and\nmanagement time,'' said Jacki Nemerov, president of Jones Apparel\nGroup, which acquired Nine West last summer. The alleged price\nfixing occurred between January 1998 and July 1999.\n\n\n   The company entered into two separate settlements, one with the\nattorneys general of the 50 states, the District of Columbia,\nPuerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Northern Mariana\nIslands and Guam. The other is with the FTC.\n\n\n   The FTC settlement prohibits Nine West from setting the price at\nwhich retailers can advertise, promote or sell shoes or coercing\nretailers to stick to any one price. The company also cannot notify\ndealers in advance that they are subject to suspension if they sell\nNine West shoes below a designated price. Nine West must also\nnotify its dealers that they have the right to set the price for\nthe company's products.\n\n\n   The agreement with the states requires a payment of $34 million.\nOf this, no more than $3.5 million will cover attorney's fees,\nwhile the rest will be used to fund women's health, educational,\nvocational and safety programs.\n\n\n   The settlement was filed in U.S. District Court in New York\nimmediately after a lawsuit was filed against Nine West in the same\ncourt. The agreement resolves the suit, but gives the court\njurisdiction over the terms of the settlement.\n\n\n   ''When even one business won't play by the rules and illegally\novercharges its customers, everybody gets hurts,'' said South\nCarolina Attorney General Charlie Condon. He is proposing that the\nstate use its portion of the money to assist rape victims and\ncrisis pregnancy centers.\n\n\n   ------\n\n\n   On the Net: Federal Trade Commission site: http://www.ftc.gov\n\n\n AP-NY-03-06-00 1547",

The company's practices\nforced women to pay artificially high prices, the governments said,\nby ending competition between stores.\n\n\n   The company agreed to settle the case without admitting\nwrongdoing. In a written statement, Jacki Nemerov, president of\nJones Apparel, said, ``We believe that this settlement was clearly\nin the best interest of our company, avoiding substantial legal\nexpense and management time.''\n\n\n   But the company's legal troubles are not over. Jones Apparel\nstill faces a class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of the millions\nof women who have purchased Nine West brands, which include Easy\nSpirit, Enzo Angiolini, 9 &AMP; Co., Bandolino, Evan-Picone, Amalfi,\nCalico, Pappagallo, Capezio, Calvin Klein, Selby, Joyce and\nWesties.\n\n\n   Nine West sells about one out of every five pairs of shoes sold\nto women in the United States. Most of those shoes are sold either\nat the company's own retail stores or at department stores,\nincluding Macy's, Bloomingdale's, Bon Marche, Lord &AMP; Taylor,\nMarshall Fields, Dillard's and Nordstrom.\n\n\n   In their complaint, federal and state investigators said that\nNine West had entered into agreements with the department stores\nand other retailers to sell shoes at set prices. Nine West demanded\nthat the stores discount the shoes only on certain dates that the\nstores and Nine West had agreed to.\n\n\n   Nine West employees monitored the stores to ensure they\ncomplied, the government said. Nine West warned the stores, the\ngovernment said, that if they did not follow the pricing rules, it\nwould stop shipping shoes or would not pay amounts it had promised\nthe stores in discounts or for advertising.\n\n\n   The pricing system meant that for years, no matter how many\nstores women shopped in, they would find the same prices for many\nNine West styles.\n\n\n   Recent court cases have weakened federal antitrust laws so that\ncompanies can do more to control prices and consumers are less\nprotected. Under the law, a company can legally tell retailers what\nprices to charge and even stop shipping goods to stores that do not\ncomply.\n\n\n   But Nine West went beyond what was legal, the government\ncontended, by seeking agreements from the stores on future shoe\nprices and on the limited dates when the shoes could be sold at a\ndiscount.\n\n\n   The government contended the illegal activities occurred before\nJones Apparel acquired on June 15, 1999.\n\n\n   The settlement requires Nine West to send a letter to all of its\nretail outlets explaining the investigation, and stating that while\nNine West can suggest retail prices, the stores are free to sell\nand advertise the shoes at any price they choose.\n\n\n   Four states _ New York, Texas, Florida and Ohio _ took a lead in\nthe investigation with the Federal Trade Commission.\n\n\n   New York will get $2 million of the settlement. Eliot L.\nSpitzer, New York's attorney general, said Monday that the amount\nwill go to battered women's shelters, breast and ovarian cancer\nresearch and preventive health programs such as mammography\nscreening.\n\n\n   ``This sends a warning to all manufacturers,'' Spitzer said,\n``that we will not tolerate illegal pricing agreements.''",

      "content": "LAWMAKERS QUESTION CLAIM THAT OIL PRICES WILL DROP SOON \n\n\n\n   WASHINGTON _ Energy Secretary Bill Richardson withstood a\ngrilling from lawmakers over high oil prices Wednesday, as\nlegislators scorned his cautious forecast that oil-exporting\ncountries would increase production later this month and end a\nyear-long steep hike in fuel prices.\n\n\n   Richardson, testifying before the House International Relations\nCommittee, rejected calls from lawmakers to quickly draw down\nemergency government oil stocks, a move that advocates say would\nlower prices. He said, however, as President Clinton did on\nTuesday, that that option was still ``on the table.''\n\n\n   With the price of oil nearly tripled, to $31.77 a barrel in the\nlast year, and with drivers facing $2-a-gallon prices at the\ngasoline pump this summer, the administration is under increasing\npressure to dip into the 600 million barrel Strategic Petroleum\nReserve in Louisiana and Texas.\n\n\n   But Richardson repeatedly urged patience while talks continued\nwith the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other\nimportant producers like Mexico.\n\n\n   ``We've got to be prudent and not overreact,'' he said, pointing\nout that the emergency stocks were meant to be used only when\nnational fuel supplies were disrupted.\n\n\n   ``I'm guardedly optimistic that OPEC will increase production\nwhen it meets on March 27,'' Richardson said. He noted that the\nMexican oil minister said Wednesday in Paris that he favored a\nproduction increase. Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Venezuela are also\nconsidering increases.\n\n\n   OPEC is considering increases of 1.2 million to 3.1 million\nbarrels a day, an about-face from production cuts of 4.3 million a\nday that began in 1998 after the financial collapse in Asia. The\ncartel now produces about 26 million barrels a day, or 35 percent\nof the world's oil production.\n\n\n   But lawmakers, especially those from the Northeast, Midwest and\nCalifornia, dismissed the encouraging statements that Richardson\nhad elicited in talks with oil officials from Kuwait, Mexico,\nNorway, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela on a weeklong trip.\n\n\n   ``Bill, you came back with nothing,'' said Rep. Donald A.\nManzullo, R-Ill. ``You got no promises.''\n\n\n   ``Congressman, I came back with quite a bit,'' Richardson, a\nformer Democratic representative from New Mexico, replied. ``Thirty\ndays ago, OPEC was saying its production cuts would continue. Now,\nkey members are saying they'll consider increases.''\n\n\n   Even if OPEC votes to raise output at its March meeting, the big\nquestions are when and by how much. Typically, it takes six weeks\nfor production in the Middle East to pass through refineries and\nreach local gas stations. ``We're running out of time,'' said Rep.\nWilliam Delahunt, D-Mass.\n\n\n   Several Democrats and Republicans expressed frustration that\nRichardson apparently did not use at least the threat of tapping\nthe strategic reserves to wring concessions from oil producers.\n\n\n   ``Why on God's green earth didn't you add to your leverage by\nopening that spigot?'' demanded Rep. Sam Gejdenson of Connecticut,\nthe panel's ranking Democrat.\n\n\n   ``Because using the Strategic Petroleum Reserve means\nintervening and manipulating the market,'' responded Richardson,\nwho said earlier that the negotiations were meant to ``convince,\nnot coerce.''\n\n\n   ``What makes sense,'' he said, ``is to let the results of our\nenergy diplomacy work.''\n\n\n   Gejdenson retorted: ``This isn't the marketplace at work. This\nis OPEC flexing its muscle.''\n\n\n   Some lawmakers, like Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R.-Calif.,\ncriticized Kuwait and Saudi Arabia for cutting back output and\ndriving up prices at a time when U.S.troops are protecting those\ncountries.\n\n\n   ``How can we keep troops in these countries when they're part of\nan international price-fixing conspiracy to shaft the people of the\nUnited States?'' Rohrabacher said.\n\n\n   ``Why has the administration sat idly by?'' asked Rep. Benjamin\nGilman, R-N.Y., who heads the committee.

There was no smoking gun,'' said  \nBriggs, a corporate relations manager from Poway. \n\n\n\tSeveral jurors said the stores' legal practice of checking and  \nmatching each other's prices could account for any similarities in \nthe cost of a dozen eggs. \n\n\n\tDon Howarth, one of the lawyers for the plaintiffs in the  \nlawsuit said he was surprised and disappointed by the outcome. \n``It's a very hard verdict after a long trial,'' he said. \n\n\n\tHowarth said the judge in the case could still rule that the  \ngrocery chains engaged in unfair competition as defined by the \nstate Cartwright Act. \n\n\n\tBut a lawyer for Vons, Gregory Stone of San Diego, said the  \njudge was unlikely to rule against the supermarkets given the \njury's verdict in the trial. \n\n\n\t``The jury was able to see that neither Vons nor the other  \ndefendants engaged in price fixing,'' Stone said. \n\n\n\tLawyers for the plaintiffs in the suit claimed that the stores  \nin Southern California counties charged an average of between $1.99 \nand $2.09 compared with prices as low as $1 per dozen elsewhere in \nthe country. \n\n\n\tThey claimed the three conspired to keep the prices high in the  \ncounties of San Diego, Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San \nBernardino and Imperial. This was accomplished, they argued, after \nan outbreak of avian flu in the early 1980s caused a spike in \nprices nationwide that eventually subsided in all regions but \nSouthern California.",

      "content": "FTC ANNOUNCES SETTLEMENT OF ANTITRUST CASE AGAINST 5 RECORD\nCOMPANIES \n\n\n\n   WASHINGTON _ The Federal Trade Commission announced a settlement\nof an antitrust case against the nation's five largest music\ncompanies on Wednesday that the commission said should result in\nsignificant price cuts for compact discs.\n\n\n   The settlement completed a two-year investigation of the\ncompanies that officials said had uncovered illegal marketing\nagreements that the music companies had used to end a price war and\ninflate the prices of compact discs. Agency officials estimated\nthat consumers had been overcharged by about $500 million over the\nlast four years.\n\n\n   Robert Pitofsky, the chairman of the Federal Trade Commission,\nsaid the settlement would enable retailers to once again advertise\ndeep discounts. He estimated that the savings to consumers could be\nas high as $17 million a month, or roughly $2 to $5 on many popular\ndiscs.\n\n\n   Pitofsky said he had based the estimates on the heavy\ndiscounting and price wars that took place before the music\nproducers wrote the marketing agreements in the mid-1990s, sharply\nrestricting the ability of retailers to advertise discounts.\n\n\n   The marketing agreements that the FTC said violated federal\nantitrust law were between many large and small retailers and the\nfive music companies, which control 85 percent of the $15 billion\nCD market. The companies that settled the case were Time Warner,\nwhich earlier this year announced it had reached an agreement with\nthe FTC; the Sony Corporation of America; Bertelsmann Music Group;\nEMI Music Distribution, and Universal Music and Video Distribution.\nAll of the companies have denied that the marketing agreements\nviolated the law, and many of them declined to discuss the FTC's\ndecision.\n\n\n   Pitofsky said the agreements, known as ``minimum advertised\nprice'' programs, or MAP, were implemented in an effort by the\nmanufacturers to end a price war earlier in the 1990s by such\ndiscounters as Circuit City, Wal-Mart, Best Buy and Target.\n\n\n   The agreements between the music companies and the retailers\nforbade music retailers from advertising discounts on CD's in\nnewspapers, on television, or even on posters in the stores\nthemselves. In exchange for those commitments, the music companies\nagreed to pay some or all of the advertising costs for the CD's.\n\n\n   After initial agreements failed to curtail the price war,\nPitofsky said, the producers toughened them so that they prohibited\nretailers from advertising discount prices even in ads that the\nretailers paid for. Pitofsky said the agency had discovered a\nmemorandum sent by one industry executive describing the more\nrestrictive program as ``MAP with teeth.''\n\n\n   Commission officials said that in the few instances where the\nretailers violated the agreements and advertised discounts, the\nmanufacturers would temporarily stop making promotional payments,\ncosting the retailers hundreds of thousands of dollars or more.\n\n\n   ``This was industry-wide vertical price-fixing,'' Pitofsky said\nat a news conference, adding that the case was a classic\nillustration of the differences in antitrust enforcement between\nthe Clinton administration and the 1980s, when officials in the\nReagan administration had a different view of antitrust law.\n``During the 1980s, retail price maintenance agreements were not\nchallenged once.''\n\n\n   A lawyer representing one of the companies said that the\ngovernment had not presented a fair or complete picture of the\nmarketing agreements.\n\n\n   The lawyer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that many\nspecialty music stores had wanted the marketing agreements because\nthey stopped discount stores from undercutting them by using CD's\nas a loss leader to attract customers. According to industry\nanalysts, many music stores were driven into bankruptcy because of\nthe earlier competition on CD prices.\n\n\n   ``The specialty stores were being very badly hurt,'' the lawyer\nsaid. ``These agreements were intended to assist those specialty\nstores maintain a wide selection of offerings, and as such, they\nwere actu",

      "content": "Twenty-one years after settling a price-fixing case with the\nFederal Trade Commission, Levi Strauss &AMP; Co. is trying to prevent\nretailers from selling its jeans at deep discounts.\n\n\n   Levi's blames plummeting sales on the erosion of its brand\nimage, and it says discounting is part of the problem.\n\n\n   Some of Levis' new policies, including a threat to pull business\nand advertising support from merchants that don't comply with new\npricing guidelines, are identical to those that led to antitrust\ncharges in the 1970s.\n\n\n   The consent decree between the company and the FTC expired last\nsummer. Also, changes in the legal landscape during the past two\ndecades have given manufacturers more freedom to suggest retail\nprices, antitrust lawyers said. Levi's new strategy, outlined in a\nletter to retailers last week, appears to be perfectly legal and\nsimilar to those of many other apparel-makers.\n\n\n   Still, the San Francisco jeansmaker, which on Monday announced\nthe closure of half of its U.S. factories, is in a vulnerable\nposition. It risks alienating merchants who already are\ndisappointed in the brand's performance. The company also could\nlose consumers who don't want to pay higher prices.\n\n\n   In the recent letter, Levi's included a list of minimum prices\nat which products may be advertised. For example, it set a minimum\nadvertised price of $21.99 for boys' stone-washed Red Tab dungarees\nand $39.99 for SilverTab jeans.\n\n\n   ``We reserve the right _ as always _ to discontinue sales of\nsome or all of our products'' to retailers that do not adhere to\nthe new policies, stated the letter, signed by John Ermatinger, the\npresident of Levi's Americas division.\n\n\n   Ermatinger also threatened to withhold advertising money from\nretailers that promote goods at low prices. Like many vendors,\nLevi's helps merchants pay for ``cooperative'' ads, which feature\nthe vendor's product and the stores' addresses.\n\n\n   It may seem counterproductive for a supplier to oppose\nattractive pricing of its merchandise. But the stakes are high:\nExecutives believe that the Levi's name is losing its legendary\nstatus, arguably the company's most valuable asset.\n\n\n   ``We're looking at a variety of initiatives to revitalize our\nbrands and communicate their quality and value,'' said spokesman\nJeff Beckman. He contends that merchants are free to set prices as\nthey wish, regardless of the potential penalties.\n\n\n   Many retailers use Levi's as a ``loss-leader'' _ a product\noffered at very low prices to lure shoppers into stores.

Klein, who launched\nthe case to break up Microsoft and won record criminal fines\nagainst international price fixers, will leave government at the\nend of this month.\n\n\n   ''The time has come to seek new challenges,'' Klein said in a\nstatement Tuesday. ''I have done what I set out to do here, and our\nwork is on the right track.''\n\n\n   Klein, 53, intends to take time off and then begin a search for\nhis next job, Justice Department spokeswoman Gina Talamona said.\n\n\n   Klein ''will not be wanting for suitors. His job search could be\none of the great auctions,'' predicted Professor William E. Kovacic\nof The George Washington University Law School.\n\n\n   During Klein's tenure, which began Oct. 18, 1996, the government\nblocked or altered about 170 mergers. In 220 criminal price-fixing\ncases, 52 executives were sent to prison, corporations paid $1.7\nbillion in fines and individuals paid another $21 million.\n\n\n   Kovacic ranked Klein among the three most influential chiefs\never to head the Justice Department's antitrust division, along\nwith Thurmond Arnold in the Roosevelt administration of the late\n1930s and early 1940s and William Baxter in the first Reagan\nadministration in the early 1980s.\n\n\n   ''He will be remembered as the man who brought the antitrust\ndivision back into the courtroom after about 15 years of living on\nsettlements, guidelines and speeches,'' Kovacic said.\n\n\n   Klein will leave before the courts render a final verdict on the\nMicrosoft case, but he won the first round. U.S. District Judge\nThomas Penfield Jackson ruled after a trial that Microsoft\nillegally used monopoly power to thwart innovation by competitors\nand ordered it split into two companies.\n\n\n   Microsoft appealed the verdict and the Supreme Court is to\ndecide soon whether to hear the appeal directly, as Klein and\nJackson proposed, or to have the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for\nthe District of Columbia hear the appeal first, as the company\nprefers.\n\n\n   The full impact of Klein's litigation campaign won't be known\nuntil appellate courts finally resolve the Microsoft case and\nKlein's cases against American Airlines for predatory action\nagainst low-cost competitors and against Visa and MasterCard for\nlimiting competition in credit cards.\n\n\n   ''Joel Klein has been a champion for America's consumers. He has\nfought tirelessly for marketplace competition, and Americans have\nenjoyed better products, more choices and lower prices as a\nresult,'' said Attorney General Janet Reno.\n\n\n   In cracking a worldwide vitamin price-fixing cartel, Klein's\ndivision obtained the largest criminal fine in Justice Department\nhistory for any kind of crime: $500 million levied against F.\nHoffmann-La Roche, a Swiss firm. BASF, a German firm, paid a $225\nmillion fine in the vitamin case.\n\n\n   The U.S. firm Archer Daniels Midland paid $100 million for\nfixing the prices of food and feed additives lysine and citric\nacid. For fixing the price of graphite electrodes used in mini\nsteel mills, SGL Carbon AG, a German firm, paid $135 million and\nUCAR, a U.S. firm, paid $110 million.\n\n\n   Opposition from Klein's division led to abandonment of an $11\nbillion merger between Lockheed Martin and Northup Grumman in the\ndefense electronics and strategic aircraft industries. WorldCom and\nSprint dropped their $129 billion telecommunications merger after\nKlein and his staff objected to increased concentration in\nlong-distance, Internet backbone and business data services.\n\n\n   In the last four years, Klein signed antitrust cooperation\nagreements with Australia, Brazil, the European Union, Israel,\nJapan and Mexico.\n\n\n   The department announced that Klein's principal deputy, Doug\nMelamed, 54, will replace him as acting assistant attorney general\nin charge of the antitrust division.\n\n\n AP-NY-09-19-00 1602",

It would cut \nconsumer prices an estimated 2 cents a gallon while boosting income \nfor farmers in the upper Midwest to the detriment of producers in \nthe East and South. \n\n\n\tLess certain was what the House-Senate conference committee  \nthat's working on the USDA spending bill would do with the issue. \n\n\n\tSupporters of an alternative pricing system want to attach it to  \nthe must-pass spending measure along with authorization for the \nregional pricing cartels. \n\n\n\t``Our nation's dairy farmers are in a crisis,'' said Rep. Thomas  \nReynolds, R-N.Y. The alternative plan ``is critical for the \nlong-term viability of farming in most states.'' \n\n\n\tBut House GOP leaders want to keep the dairy issue out of the  \nspending bill, lawmakers said, and that forced the conference \ncommittee to break up for the night Tuesday without an agreement on \nwhat to do. \n\n\n\tFarmers in the East and South say the USDA plan would cost them  \nas much as $200 million and drive many producers out of business. \nProducers overwhelmingly approved the plan in an August referendum, \nbut opponents say that was only because there was no alternative \nfor farmers to vote on. \n\n\n\t``It was just a railroad job. ... Nobody wanted it, and nobody  \nsupported it,'' said Heck Davis, a Georgia dairy farmer. \n\n\n\tThe regional pricing organizations, such as one now operating in  \nNew England, set prices different than the federal system. The New \nEngland system is set to expire Oct. 1 unless Congress keeps it \nalive. \n\n\n\tThe issue has pitted Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., against fellow  \nliberals like Sen. Herb Kohl and Rep. David Obey, Wisconsin \nDemocrats who are among the chief Democratic negotiators on the \nappropriations measure. Kohl threatened to sidetrack the \nlegislation if Leahy succeeds. \n\n\n\tThe issue also could pose a problem for some senators up for  \nre-election next year, including Republicans Rod Grams of \nMinnesota, considered one of the most vulnerable GOP incumbents, \nand James Jeffords of Vermont. \n\n\n\tConsumer groups back USDA's pricing plan and oppose the  \nprice-fixing compacts. \n\n\n\tUnder the government's current system, guaranteed minimum prices  \nfor fluid milk are lowest in the upper Midwest and highest in the \nSouth and West, up to $3 per hundred pounds higher in some places, \nbecause the price is based on a farm's distance from Eau Claire, \nWis. \n\n\n\tUSDA's new plan would narrow the pricing disparities and throw  \nout the Eau Claire system. \n\n\n\tThe current system was designed to spur production in areas  \nwhere it had been scarce. But today, milk can easily be trucked by \nrefrigerated truck from one region to another, according to \nsupporters of the plan. \n\n\n\tAll but six states are covered by the federal system:  \nCalifornia, Virginia, Wyoming, Montana, Hawaii and Alaska.",

Doctors write more than 21 million prescriptions\na year for the medications.\n\n\n   Mylan denied all the charges. Milan Puskar, chairman of the\nPittsburgh-based company, said the commission's action was\n``radical, rushed and wrong.''\n\n\n   Mylan's shares dropped $3.3125, to $26.75, in New York Stock\nExchange trading after the accusations were announced.\n\n\n   The government asserts that after locking up the supply of raw\nmaterials, Mylan was able to raise prices to an astounding degree.\nIn January, the agency said,Mylan raised the wholesale price for\none drug, clorazepate, to $377 for a bottle of 500 tablets, up from\n$11.36 for the same quantity. And in March, it said, the wholesale\nprice for the other drug, lorazepam, went to $190, from $7.30, for\na bottle of 500 tablets.\n\n\n   ``Mylan's outrageous price increases have cost consumers at\nleast $120 million in higher prices,'' said William Baer, director\nof the agency's bureau of competition. Patients, many of them\nelderly, take these drugs for long periods, and it may be dangerous\nfor them to halt treatment suddenly, he said.\n\n\n   Baer said Mylan's price increases had generated ``a tremendous\nnumber of consumer complaints,'' more than any other issue in the\nlast four years, as well as a large number of protests from members\nof Congress.\n\n\n   He acknowledged that the generic drugs cost much less than the\nbrand-name versions, even after the price increases. But he said\nthe lawsuit was justified as a way to preserve competition among\nmakers of generic drugs.\n\n\n   The brand-name version of lorazepam is Ativan, made by the\nWyeth-Ayerst Laboratories unit of American Home Products Corp. The\nbrand-name version of clorazepate, Tranxene, is made by Abbott\nLaboratories.\n\n\n   Kevin Arquit of Rogers &AMP; Wells, a lawyer for Mylan, said,\n``Mylan's prices for the generic drugs are less than half of the\nprices for the brand-name products, which are therapeutically\nidentical.''\n\n\n   The commission voted 4 to 0 Monday to sue Mylan in federal\ncourt. The complaint will name four defendants: Mylan; Profarmaco,\nan Italian company that supplies raw materials to Mylan; the\nCambrex Corporation of East Rutherford, N.J., which is the parent\nof Profarmaco, and Gyma Laboratories of America, based in Westbury,\nN.Y., a distributor for Profarmaco.\n\n\n   In demanding refunds, the commission is testing a relatively new\nenforcement strategy. The agency often seeks injunctions requiring\nviolators of the antitrust laws to halt their illegal conduct, but\nit has rarely tried to force companies to surrender what the\ncommission regards as ill-gotten gains.\n\n\n   Mylan said its agreement with Profarmaco had a legitimate\npurpose: to guarantee an adequate, uninterrupted supply of\nchemicals. But, it said, in the last few weeks it decided not to\nenforce provisions of the contract under which Mylan was to receive\nall the output of certain chemicals made by Profarmaco.\n\n\n   In its latest annual report, Mylan said that it had taken ``a\nvery aggressive position and raised prices'' on many products.\n\n\n   Herbert Hovenkamp, a University of Iowa professor who wrote a\nleading treatise on antitrust law, said a court order requiring\nconsumer refunds was ``an aggressive remedy'' for the FTC to seek\nat the start of an case.\n\n\n   Baer said the complaint would charge that Mylan had violated\nSection 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914, which\noutlaws ``unfair methods of competition.''\n\n\n   The commission is accusing My",

Colbert said that after fixing \nfour games for Chicago bookmaker Benny Silman, Smith figured he \ncould make extra money by getting another party to also pay him to \nfix the game. \n\n\n\tColbert said Smith talked to another ASU student, whose name has  \nnot been released, and that friend contacted Frank who apparently \ndidn't know the game was already being fixed. \n\n\n\tFrank allegedly paid Smith $5,000 to shave points.  \n\n\n\tHe is the eighth person to be accused in the growing  \npoint-shaving scheme. \n\n\n\tSilman, the alleged mastermind of the original scheme, is  \nserving a 46-month sentence for getting Smith and ASU guard Isaac \nBurton to shave points in certain games so the team wouldn't beat \nthe point spread. \n\n\n\tSmith agreed to fix four games for $20,000 a game, in part to  \nerase a reported $10,000 gambling debt to Silman, authorities said. \nBurton was paid $4,300 for helping fix two games, authorities said. \n\n\n\tIn addition to Washington, the other 1994 games in question were  \nthose with Oregon State on Jan. 27, Oregon on Jan. 29, and Southern \nCalifornia on Feb. 19. \n\n\n\tSmith, Burton, Phoenix investment adviser Joseph Gagliano Jr.,  \nChicago trucking company executive Dominic Mangiamele and his son, \nJoseph, are awaiting sentencing. \n\n\n\tLast month, another person was indicted in the scheme.  \n\n\n\tVincent Basso of Buffalo Grove, Ill., was indicted on charges of  \nsports bribery, interstate travel in aid of racketeering and \nmoney-laundering. Prosecutors didn't release his role in the \nscheme.",

Klein, who launched\nthe case to break up Microsoft and won record criminal fines\nagainst international price fixers, will leave government at the\nend of this month.\n\n\n   ''The time has come to seek new challenges,'' Klein said in a\nstatement Tuesday. ''I have done what I set out to do here, and our\nwork is on the right track.''\n\n\n   Klein, 53, intends to take time off and then begin a search for\nhis next job, Justice Department spokeswoman Gina Talamona said.\n\n\n   Klein ''will not be wanting for suitors. His job search could be\none of the great auctions,'' predicted Professor William E. Kovacic\nof The George Washington University Law School.\n\n\n   During Klein's tenure, which began Oct. 18, 1996, the government\nblocked or altered about 170 mergers. In 220 criminal price-fixing\ncases, 52 executives were sent to prison, corporations paid $1.7\nbillion in fines and individuals paid another $21 million.\n\n\n   Kovacic ranked Klein among the three most influential chiefs\never to head the Justice Department's antitrust division, along\nwith Thurmond Arnold in the Roosevelt administration of the late\n1930s and early 1940s and William Baxter in the first Reagan\nadministration in the early 1980s.\n\n\n   ''He will be remembered as the man who brought the antitrust\ndivision back into the courtroom after about 15 years of living on\nsettlements, guidelines and speeches,'' Kovacic said.\n\n\n   In an interview, Klein said he was proudest of the antitrust\ndivision's litigation record and noted that his division had\nconfronted a more than 25-fold increase in merger volume, from $72\nbillion in the last year of the Bush administration to $2 trillion\nthis year. ''It's inevitable the marketplace will push the envelope\nand try more and more aggressive mergers, and at some points, we\nhave had to say 'no','' Klein said.\n\n\n   Klein received bipartisan praise Tuesday from the Senate\nantitrust subcommittee. ''Joel has been a terrific head of the\nantitrust division. He has made a lot of difficult calls and, in\nour opinion, made most of them correctly,'' Sens. Mike DeWine,\nR-Ohio, and Herb Kohl, D-Wis., the chairman and ranking minority\nmember, said in a statement.\n\n\n   Klein will leave before the courts render a final verdict on the\nMicrosoft case, but he won the first round. U.S. District Judge\nThomas Penfield Jackson ruled after a trial that Microsoft\nillegally used monopoly power to thwart innovation by competitors\nand ordered it split into two companies.\n\n\n   Microsoft appealed the verdict and the Supreme Court is to\ndecide soon whether to hear the appeal directly, as Klein and\nJackson proposed, or to have the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for\nthe District of Columbia hear the appeal first, as the company\nprefers.\n\n\n   The full impact of Klein's litigation campaign won't be known\nuntil appellate courts finally resolve the Microsoft case and\nKlein's cases against American Airlines for predatory action\nagainst low-cost competitors and against Visa and MasterCard for\nlimiting competition in credit cards.\n\n\n   ''Joel Klein has been a champion for America's consumers. He has\nfought tirelessly for marketplace competition, and Americans have\nenjoyed better products, more choices and lower prices as a\nresult,'' said Attorney General Janet Reno.\n\n\n   In cracking a worldwide vitamin price-fixing cartel, Klein's\ndivision obtained the largest criminal fine in Justice Department\nhistory for any kind of crime: $500 million levied against F.\nHoffmann-La Roche, a Swiss firm. BASF, a German firm, paid a $225\nmillion fine in the vitamin case.\n\n\n   The U.S. firm Archer Daniels Midland paid $100 million for\nfixing the prices of food and feed additives lysine and citric\nacid. For fixing the price of graphite electrodes used in mini\nsteel mills, SGL Carbon AG, a German firm, paid $135 million and\nUCAR, a U.S. firm, paid $110 million.\n\n\n   Opposition from Klein's division led to abandonment of an $11\nbillion merger between Lockheed Mar",

Worthington, who as president of U.S. Steel Corp.\nguided the company out of a prolonged steelworkers' strike and into\na confrontation with President John F. Kennedy over the industry's\n's attempt to raise steel prices, died Aug. 3 at his home in\nLigonier, Pa. He was 96.\n\n\n   The son of a coal miner who came to the United States from\nEngland with his family in 1907, Worthington was elected the eighth\npresident of the country's largest steel manufacturer on Nov. 10,\n1959.\n\n\n   At the time, U.S. Steel was four months into a six-month strike\nby steelworkers, then the longest strike in the industry's history.\nThe labor dispute was settled in January 1960 after intervention by\nVice President Richard Nixon and Labor Secretary James Mitchell.\n\n\n   Even for someone who had spent his entire career in the steel\nindustry, Worthington's move to the top ranks of corporate America\ncame earlier than expected. His predecessor, Walter Mumford, had\nbeen president of U.S. Steel for only a few months in 1959 when he\naccidentally inflicted a knife wound on himself. A day after\nundergoing surgery to repair the wound, Mumford suffered a stroke.\nHe died shortly thereafter.\n\n\n   At the time of Worthington's appointment, observers on Wall\nStreet expected him to fight a pitched battle against the low-cost\nimported steel that was dogging the industry. Like the company\nfounder Charles M. Schwab, Worthington's background was in sales,\nrather than manufacturing. He joined Carnegie-Illinois Steel Corp.\nas a sales apprentice in 1923 after graduation from the University\nof Illinois, and worked his way up through the marketing ranks,\nheading the company's sales offices in St. Paul, Minn.; Detroit and\nPittsburgh.\n\n\n   In 1942, Worthington moved to U.S. Steel Supply Corp. as a vice\npresident, becoming president in 1946, a post he held for 11 years.\nIn 1957, he was named president of the company's big\nColumbia-Geneva Steel division in San Francisco.\n\n\n   After taking over as president and a director of the parent\ncompany in 1959, Worthington remained second-in-command to U.S.\nSteel chairman Roger Blough. But as head of the company's executive\ncommittee, Worthington was most often the company's public face.\n\n\n   As such, he used the wage increases granted to steelworkers in\n1960 and again in 1962 as an opportunity to engage in a battle of\nwills with the Kennedy administration, which had chastised the\nsteel industry for failing to make enough investments in new plants\nand equipment.\n\n\n   Worthington countered by arguing that the industry's real\nproblems were caused by cheaper imports, made overseas by workers\nwho earned less than one-third the $32 a day paid to American\nsteelworkers, and from domestic manufacturers of rival materials,\nlike aluminum and plastics.\n\n\n   The confrontation reached a culmination in April 1962, when U.S.\nSteel announced its first price increase in four years, raising the\nprice of steel mill products by $6 a ton, to $176.\n\n\n   The move shocked and enraged Kennedy, who attacked the increase\nas ``a chilling and irresponsible defiance of the nation's\ninterest'' and ordered a federal grand jury investigation of U.S.\nSteel under the Sherman Antitrust Act.\n\n\n   After three days of rhetoric and negotiation, which included a\nmove by the Defense Department, the biggest steel buyer in the\nnation, to divert purchases to other manufacturers, U.S. Steel\nfollowed the lead of several smaller steel makers in rescinding the\nprice increase.\n\n\n   But that was not the end of the acrimony. Two weeks later, U.S.\nSteel and Bethlehem Steel Co. were indicted on charges of violating\nfederal antitrust laws. Federal officials said the indictment had\nnothing to do with the aborted price increase, but again in\nSeptember 1962, U.S. Steel was one of 15 companies named in a\nfederal indictment for conspiracy to fix prices of plastic hose and\npipe.\n\n\n   In April 1963, U.S. Steel and the other steel companies finally\npushed through ``selected price adjustments'' that averaged $4.85 a\nton.

      "content": "MAJOR AUCTION HOUSES FACE ANTITRUST LAWSUITS \n\n\n\n   NEW YORK _ In the art world Herbert Black is known as a man who\nloves paintings and antiques and loathes the auction houses where\nhe buys and sells them. Suddenly he has a lot of company.\n\n\n   Black, a copper trader from Montreal, is suing the two major\nart-auction houses, Sotheby's and Christie's. So is a\nphilanthropist who endowed an Arizona art museum. And a New York\nbusinesswoman once known as the Tugboat Empress. And a Minnesota\nart gallery. And a Florida retiree. And about three dozen other\npeople, some of whom may have simply bought a wristwatch or sold a\ngreat aunt's antique commode.\n\n\n   All of these disgruntled customers contend that they were\novercharged because of collusion by the two rival auction houses,\nand they are basing their suits in a criminal antitrust\ninvestigation being conducted by the U.S. Justice Department.\n\n\n   As part of that process a federal grand jury in Manhattan is\nlooking into whether the auction houses conspired to fix the\ncommissions they charged buyers and sellers at auctions dating as\nfar back as 1992, said people in the art and legal worlds who are\ninvolved in the matter.\n\n\n   The fallout is likely to be not just embarrassing but also\nexpensive for Sotheby's and Christie's, which could end up paying\ntheir irate clients tens of millions of dollars.\n\n\n   Some in the art world worry that publicity from the antitrust\ncase will shake the public's confidence at a time when the art\nmarket has been booming. ``For a lot of people to whom the art\nworld is hype anyway, does it increase their fears and cynicism?''\nwondered Angela Westwater, a dealer in contemporary art in SoHo.\n\n\n   For Sotheby's, the outcome could be even more dire. The company\nfaces steep fines, and its top executives face short prison terms,\nif the Justice Department's investigation results in criminal\ncharges.\n\n\n   That prospect became more likely last month, when Christie's\nannounced that in return for immunity from criminal prosecution, it\nwas cooperating with the investigation and turning over information\nto the Justice Department. The announcement suggests that\nChristie's has admitted wrongdoing; it leaves Sotheby's at risk\nbecause prosecutors offer amnesty only to the first member of a\ncartel to spill the beans.\n\n\n   Sotheby's has not commented on the investigation, except to say\nthat it was cooperating with prosecutors; nor has it responded to\nthe allegations of price-fixing.\n\n\n   Sotheby's stock price has plunged from its high, last spring, of\n$47 to $17} on Friday. Ron Baron, president of Baron Capital\nManagement, by far the largest outside shareholder in Sotheby's,\ndescribed himself as ``surprised, puzzled and disappointed'' at the\nantitrust news, though he said he was confident that the outcome\nwould not be financially significant.\n\n\n   Christie's, which was bought by a French businessman for over $1\nbillion in 1998, is now a private company and is no longer\nobligated to report its financial results publicly.\n\n\n   Both companies, which control about 95 per cent of the $4\nbillion worldwide auction market, will have to cope with the\nlawsuits by disgruntled customers. If the plaintiffs win, they can\nrecover three times the damages they suffered. The losses could\ncome at a bad time. Both auction houses have just spent huge sums\non snazzy headquarters, and Sotheby's is pouring millions of\ndollars into an Internet auction business.\n\n\n   The investigation could also result in increased governmental\nregulation. The New York City Department of Consumer Affairs, which\nregulates auctioneers, is ``following the antitrust action\nclosely,'' said Jules Polonetsky, commissioner of the department.\nMoreover, the art dealers fear that increasing the number of\nregulations in the auction business could have a negative effect on\nthe entire art trade.\n\n\n   Many in the insular art world are riveted by the drama and are\nwaiting for Sotheby's next move. Some dealers and collectors, who\ngenerally have a love-hate relationship with the two big houses,\nseem to be privately both aghast an",

Robert Bennett, R-Utah, who heads the Senate panel with Sen. \nChristopher Dodd, D-Conn. Problems ``will not occur across the \nnation. They will occur across the street.'' \n\n\n\tBennett's committee has held nearly 30 hearings since spring of  \nlast year on the consequences of the Y2K glitch, in which computers \nprogrammed to read only the last two digits of a year might mistake \nthe year 2000, or ``00,'' as 1900. \n\n\n\tHe noted that the federal government will have spent some $8  \nbillion to fix its computers and the nation as a whole anywhere \nfrom $50 billion to $150 billion. \n\n\n\tThis investment, he said, ``appears to have paid off.'' National  \npower grids, phone systems, ATM machines and air travel should work \nfine on Jan. 1. \n\n\n\t``I do not expect the four horsemen, armed with flood and  \ncatastrophe, to be riding in on Jan. 1, 2000,'' said Sen. Daniel \nPatrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., one of the first lawmakers to raise the \nY2K issue. \n\n\n\tBut the report also warned against complacency. It cited an  \nAugust survey that concluded that seven states -- Alabama, \nCalifornia, Colorado, Hawaii, New Hampshire, New Mexico and Wyoming \n-- had fixed less than 70 percent of systems affecting such programs \nas child nutrition, food stamps and unemployment insurance. \n\n\n\tCalifornia's top Y2K official said the Senate's numbers are out  \nof date. Chief Information Officer Elias Cortez told a legislative \ncommittee last week that 95 percent of the state's important \ncomputer systems are fixed and have been checked by outside experts \nas of Sept. 1. \n\n\n\tThe Health Care Financing Administration, which oversees  \nMedicaid and Medicare, listed eight states this month as ``high \nrisk'' in terms of keeping up with Medicaid child health insurance \nor eligibility claims after Jan. 1. They were Alabama, Alaska, \nMassachusetts, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, North \nDakota and Vermont. \n\n\n\tNorth Dakota officials said the list was based on a March review  \nof state procedures. Sheldon Wolf, the state's assistant Medicaid \ndirector, said HCFA did a second assessment earlier this month and \nthe preliminary conclusion was that North Dakota's computer systems \nare at low risk for Year 2000 problems. \n\n\n\tThe report gave its top five stars to the financial services  \nindustry for having the lowest risk of Y2K-related failures, and \nfour stars to the utilities and telecommunications sectors. Getting \nits worst two-star ratings were the health care industry and the \nY2K situation outside the United States. \n\n\n\tWhile large-scale hospitals have invested in computer fixes, it  \nfound a less positive outlook for small inner-city and rural \nhospitals and among the nation's 800,000 doctors. \n\n\n\tThe report named Russia, China and Italy among the many  \ncountries that appear to be far behind in fixing computers, raising \nthe possibility of economic downturns. Disruptions in oil flows may \naffect gas prices, although the Energy Department believes this \nwill not occur. \n\n\n\tIn other areas, the report said the committee was surprised by  \nthe wastewater industry's low level of readiness.

      "content": "MONSANTO SUED OVER USE OF BIOTECHNOLOGY IN DEVELOPING SEEDS \n\n\n\n   Some of the nation's most prominent antitrust lawyers filed a\nclass-action lawsuit against Monsanto Co. on Tuesday, accusing it\nof rushing genetically engineered seeds to the marketplace without\nproperly testing them for safety, and of forming an international\ncartel that conspired to control the world's market in corn and\nsoybean seeds.\n\n\n   The lawsuit, which was filed in U.S. District Court in\nWashington on behalf of six farmers, is the latest skirmish in the\ndebate over the use of bio-engineered seeds, which are popular\namong American farmers but troubling to consumers in Europe and to\nenvironmental groups that contend that they are potentially\ndangerous to humans and the environment.\n\n\n   The suit, which contends that Monsanto is at the hub of an\ninternational conspiracy to control a large part of the world's\nseed supply, was brought on behalf of a coalition of small farmers\nand farm groups that accuse Monsanto of giving farmers false and\nfraudulent guarantees on the safety and marketability of a new\nbreed of bio-engineered seeds. But some of the nation's largest\nfarm groups criticized the suit, saying that American farmers have\nlargely benefited from new technologies in the seed market, which\nhave reduced the use of herbicides and pesticides and increased\ncrop yields.\n\n\n   Monsanto denounced the suit, arguing that its biotechnology\nproducts were safe and that they had been approved by U.S.\nregulators. The company, which is based in St. Louis, also denied\nthat it engaged in any anti-competitive practices.\n\n\n   ``We are extremely disappointed that the plaintiffs have filed a\nlawsuit without merit,'' said David Snively, an assistant general\ncounsel at Monsanto, which is one of the world's largest\nagricultural seed and chemical companies. ``We have complied with\nevery part of the law and now we're dealing with lawyers who don't\ncare about science and are trying to make a political statement.''\n\n\n   The real force behind the suit is a coalition of environmental\ngroups, including Greenpeace, that are serving as advisers in the\ncase. The initiator of the lawsuit is Jeremy Rifkin, the\nenvironmental activist who has repeatedly decried biotech crops as\npotentially dangerous and likely to lead to ``genetic pollution''\nand the creation of ``superweeds'' that could drastically alter the\nenvironment.\n\n\n   Rifkin, a longtime critic of Monsanto, said Tuesday that about a\nyear ago he hired what he calls a ``Dream Team of the Green\nmovement'' _ a group of antitrust lawyers from 10 firms who are now\nusing words reminiscent of the Justice Department's case against\nMicrosoft, such as contentions that Monsanto has gained monopoly\nstatus through the use of bully tactics, intimidation, deceptive\nbusiness practices and restrictive technology deals with small\nfarmers.\n\n\n   Heading the case is Michael Hausfeld, the Washington attorney\nwho is best known for defending Alaskan natives in the Exxon Valdez\noil spill, and more recently for helping to win a $1.1 billion\nprice-fixing settlement against the world's largest vitamin makers.\nHausfeld is also representing victims forced by Nazis to work\nduring World War II.\n\n\n   Also considering a lead role in the suit is David Boies, the New\nYork attorney who led the Justice Department's prosecution of\nMicrosoft.

      "content": "FIXING THE BLAME FOR GLOBAL ECONOMIC CRACKUPS \n\n\n\n   DAVOS, Switzerland _ Among the movers and shakers gathered here\nfor the World Economic Forum, a striking metaphor is helping to\nframe the debate over the global financial crisis that began in\nAsia and has spread to several other developing countries. The\ndebacle, some say, brings to mind a slick stretch of highway, scene\nof a half-dozen recent auto accidents. So is it careless driving or\nthe highway that is the cause of the accidents?\n\n\n   Substitute freewheeling worldwide capital flows and unrestricted\nlending for the slippery, fast-moving highway. Make South Korea,\nThailand, Indonesia, Russia and Brazil stand-ins for the drivers\nand their cars. The accidents are the panics and recessions _ the\ncrackups _ that have devastated each of these countries. And the\nquestion now so widely debated is simple enough: Are the countries\nmostly to blame or the unrestricted capital flows, or both?\n\n\n   After the first accidents, the countries came in for almost all\nthe blame. It was because of crony capitalism, bad banking and\noverleveraged real estate investments, many experts said. Fix the\nsloppy financial practices and also make enough bailout money\navailable when a country gets into trouble _ basically the current\nstrategy of the International Monetary Fund for Brazil _ and the\naccidents will be avoided or, at worst, will be mere fender\nbenders.\n\n\n   But spectacular wrecks have occurred with alarming frequency and\nseverity in the last 18 months, even in Brazil, and some who had\nmostly blamed the countries have begun to argue, here and in\nearlier interviews, that the system needs serious fixing, too.\n\n\n   The Clinton administration had placed most of the blame on the\ncountries, and still does. But its view, like that of the IMF, is\nstarting to reflect a more nuanced appraisal. ``We have seen that\ncountries need to pursue sounder policies and avoid lurching for\nshort-term capital, as Mexico and Thailand did,'' said Lawrence\nSummers, the deputy treasury secretary. But in a phone interview\nthis week from Washington, he also called for ``more prudence on\nthe part of the lenders.''\n\n\n   And in the administration's most direct acknowledgment so far\nthat it is not necessarily always committed to unrestricted capital\nflows, he added: ``Where countries have controls that restrict\nshort-term lending, we have not in general sought to dismantle\nthem.''\n\n\n   Some on Wall Street are similarly shifting ground. ``It is\nappropriate to certainly consider fixing the system,'' said Stephen\nRoach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. Morgan\nStanley normally makes more money when capital flows freely and the\nfirm can lend where and how it sees best.\n\n\n   But the recent string of crackups has given Roach second\nthoughts. ``I am not completely convinced that restrictions on the\nsystem are necessary,'' he said, ``but unstable capital flows have\nclearly been a precipitant of these crises.''\n\n\n   At the top of many lists for fixing the system are proposals to\nlimit the flow of short-term foreign loans to developing countries,\nloans that often contributed to more rapid growth but which piled\nup in huge amounts in Asia, Russia and Brazil. Then, at the first\nhint of trouble, much of the money fled, precipitating and\nworsening a full-scale financial collapse.\n\n\n   But other systemwide suggestions are winning favor as well:\npursing flexible exchange rates, for example, to avoid sudden,\nfrightening devaluations; introducing bankruptcy laws that let\ncompanies deep in foreign debt borrow and resume operations even\nbefore they pay off the old debts; and standstill provisions in\nlending agreements that would temporarily prevent a foreign lender\nfrom withdrawing loans from a South Korea or a Brazil in the midst\nof a crisis.\n\n\n   What they have in common is an effort to put more of the burden\non international banks and other lenders to evaluate risks more\ncarefully early on and suffer more of the consequences later if\nthings go bad.\n\n\n   ``The banks don't like this; they value liquidity of lending,''\nsaid",

      "content": "1999-09-22 14:20:25 \n washington \n Senate: U.S. Should Be OK for Y2K \n\n\n\tWASHINGTON (AP) -- The world won't end on Jan. 1 with a  \nY2K-related computer crash, but Americans should be ready for \nshort-term disruptions ranging from higher gas prices to local \npower outages, a Senate panel said Wednesday. \n\n\n\tWith 100 days left before computers run up against the year 2000  \ndate, federal agencies and the national infrastructure are in solid \nshape, but seven states remain in the ``danger zone'' with less \nthan 70 percent of computer systems ready, the Y2K panel said in \nits final report. \n\n\n\tThe situation is similar in the private sector, with big  \nbusinesses, particularly in the banking and investment industry, \nconfident their computers are ready while many smaller businesses \ncould run into trouble. \n\n\n\t``There will not be a horizontal, systematic failure,'' said  \nSen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, who heads the Senate panel with Sen. \nChristopher Dodd, D-Conn. Problems ``will not occur across the \nnation. They will occur across the street.'' \n\n\n\tBennett's committee has held nearly 30 hearings since spring of  \nlast year on the consequences of the Y2K glitch, in which computers \nprogrammed to read only the last two digits of a year might mistake \nthe year 2000, or ``00,'' as 1900. \n\n\n\tHe noted that the federal government will have spent some $8  \nbillion to fix its computers and the nation as a whole anywhere \nfrom $50 billion to $150 billion. \n\n\n\tThis investment, he said, ``appears to have paid off.'' National  \npower grids, phone systems, ATM machines and air travel should work \nfine on Jan. 1. \n\n\n\t``I do not expect the four horsemen, armed with flood and  \ncatastrophe, to be riding in on Jan. 1, 2000,'' said Sen. Daniel \nPatrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., one of the first lawmakers to raise the \nY2K issue. \n\n\n\tBut the report also warned against complacency. It cited an  \nAugust survey that concluded that seven states -- Alabama, \nCalifornia, Colorado, Hawaii, New Hampshire, New Mexico and Wyoming \n-- had fixed less than 70 percent of systems affecting such programs \nas child nutrition, food stamps and unemployment insurance. \n\n\n\tThe Health Care Financing Administration, which oversees  \nMedicaid and Medicare, listed eight states this month as ``high \nrisk'' in terms of keeping up with Medicaid child health insurance \nor eligibility claims after Jan. 1. They were Alabama, Alaska, \nMassachusetts, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, North \nDakota and Vermont. \n\n\n\tNorth Dakota officials said the list was based on a March review  \nof state procedures. Sheldon Wolf, the state's assistant Medicaid \ndirector, said HCFA did a second assessment earlier this month and \nthe preliminary conclusion was that North Dakota's computer systems \nare at low risk for Year 2000 problems. \n\n\n\tThe report gave its top five stars to the financial services  \nindustry for having the lowest risk of Y2K-related failures, and \nfour stars to the utilities and telecommunications sectors. Getting \nits worst two-star ratings were the health care industry and the \nY2K situation outside the United States. \n\n\n\tWhile large-scale hospitals have invested in computer fixes, it  \nfound a less positive outlook for small inner-city and rural \nhospitals and among the nation's 800,000 doctors. \n\n\n\tThe report named Russia, China and Italy among the many  \ncountries that appear to be far behind in fixing computers, raising \nthe possibility of economic downturns. Disruptions in oil flows may \naffect gas prices, although the Energy Department believes this \nwill not occur. \n\n\n\tIn other areas, the report said the committee was surprised by  \nthe wastewater industry's low level of readiness. Short-term local \npower or phone outages were possible and computer problems among \nsmall businesses that lack the money or the technology to fix their \nsystems ``could have a ripple effect ... that will affect their \nbigger business partners.'' \n\n\n\tBut it warned against overreacting, saying, ``One great area of  \nconcern is that panic buying and stockpiling of food might result \nin a",
