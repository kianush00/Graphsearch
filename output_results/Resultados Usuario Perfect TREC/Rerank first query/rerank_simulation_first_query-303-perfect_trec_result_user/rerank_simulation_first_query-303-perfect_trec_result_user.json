      "content": "NEW TELESCOPES PAY OFF IN THE DETAILS \n\n\n\n   &UR;  &LR;  Astronomers in the 1990s are seeing the dawn of an\nunprecedented golden age: New telescopes of a size and power\nundreamed of just a few years ago are busting out all over,\npromising to open the floodgates for a cascade of discoveries.\n\n\n   Just last week, astronomers unveiled the ``first light'' images\nof a new telescope that will survey the night skies to produce the\ndefinitive roadmap of the heavens for decades to come. Two weeks\nearlier, a new instrument prosaically called the Very Large\nTelescope, whose makers say it is now the most powerful in the\nworld, produced its own dazzling ``first light'' pictures _ the\nastronomers' term for the first usable astronomical images from a\nnew scope.\n\n\n   Much more is on the way: While the venerable 200-inch Hale\ntelescope on Palomar Mountain reigned supreme for nearly four\ndecades, four new telescopes that surpass it have been completed\nthis decade, and at least a half-dozen more will join the ranks\nover the next three years.\n\n\n   Several factors have combined to make this remarkable telescopic\nrennaissance possible: The dramatic and ever-growing power of\ncomputers to control huge scopes with pinpoint precision using\nsmaller, simpler mountings, breakthrough concepts for making the\ngiant slabs of glass for telescope mirrors, and innovative\nbarn-like replacements for the unwieldy observatory domes of yore.\n\n\n   The Very Large Telescope, built by a consortium of eight nations\nknown as the European Southern Observatory and installed on a\nmountaintop called Cerro Paranal in the Chilean Andes, will\neventually consist of four identical linked telescopes. When\ncompleted in two years, the four telescopes will be arrayed so that\ntheir light can be combined, simulating one telescopic behemoth far\nbigger than any telescope in existence or planned. (The Hubble\ntelescope, by contrast, gains its power to see fine detail by\nescaping the atmosphere's turbulence; the scope itself is modest in\nsize, exceeded by no fewer than 30 telescopes around the world.)\n\n\n   Even now, with just one of its telescopes completed, the Chilean\nobservatory reports that its first images demonstrate an ability to\ndetect fine details _ called ``resolving power'' _ that ``even at\nthis early stage, is unequalled by any large ground-based\ntelescope.''\n\n\n   The telescope's main mirror is 8.2 meters, or about 27 feet, in\ndiameter _ making it the largest one-piece telescope mirror now in\nservice. It is unlike any of the other large telescope mirrors now\nin use or being built: It is made of a thin sheet of glass glued\nonto a honeycomb supporting structure. This unusual design makes it\nflexible enough so that tiny computer-controlled devices can\nconstantly monitor and adjust its surface shape.\n\n\n   Other large mirrors have either been assembled from an array of\nhexagonal pieces fitted together like a tile floor, or cast in one\nlarge solid piece to give them enough strength to hold their shape,\nbut with hollowed-out spaces in the back to lower their weight. The\nVLT's innovative flexible mirrors may set a new standard for the\nfuture.\n\n\n   But size isn't everything. The Sloan Digital Sky survey uses a\nnew telescope whose mirror is neither exceptionally large (albeit\nslightly bigger than Hubble's) nor unusual in design. But this new\ntelescope, based at Apache Point, N.M., is innovative in other\nways: A unique robotically-controlled system can move 640 optical\nfibers so that each one aligns with a specific galaxy in the\nscope's unusually wide field of view. That enables it to take\nspectrograms _ spreading out the colors of the object's light to\nreveal its chemical composition, distance and motion _ of hundreds\nof galaxies at once.\n\n\n   By the time it is completed, the telescope's survey will have\ndetermined the distance and velocity of a million galaxies and\n100,000 quasars _ far more than all the world's telescopes combined\nhave produced in the history of astronomy.\n\n\n   The unusually sensitive and comprehensive coverage of this new\nsurvey is expected to provide the photog",

      "content": "NEW MEASUREMENT SUGGESTS UNIVERSE IS YOUNGER THAN BELIEVED \n\n\n\n   CHICAGO _ Using an array of radio telescopes stretching more\nthan 5,000 miles from Hawaii to the Virgin Islands, astronomers\nhave made what they say is the most accurate measurement ever of\nthe distance to a galaxy far beyond the Milky Way _ 23.5 million\nlight-years from here to a prominent galaxy in the constellation\nUrsa Major, the Great Bear.\n\n\n   Scientists said the measurement, announced here on Tuesday at a\nmeeting of the American Astronomical Society, raised serious\nquestions about the precision of recent estimates of the expansion\nrate and age of the universe, including those reported last week by\nastronomers using data from the Hubble Space Telescope.\n\n\n   The new findings appeared to expose a possible shortcoming in\nthe basic galactic distances used in previous calculations of the\nrate at which space and time are expanding from the explosive\nmoment of cosmic creation in the theoretical Big Bang. If the\ngalaxy measurement is correct, the universe is about 15 percent\nsmaller _ hence 15 percent younger _ than calculated on the basis\nof the Hubble telescope data. That previous estimate put the age of\nthe universe at between 12 billion and 14 billion years old.\n\n\n   ``We're questioning whether their ruler is really a foot long''\nand not 10 or 11 inches, said Dr. James Moran, a member of the\nradio astronomy team from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for\nAstrophysics in Cambridge, Mass.\n\n\n   If cosmic distances have been measured inaccurately and the\nuniverse is indeed younger than previously estimated, it would\ncause consternation among cosmologists. Any age much less than 12\nbillion years would again raise the troubling paradox of a universe\nseeming to be younger than its oldest stars.\n\n\n   Dr. James Herrnstein of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory\nin Socorro, N.M., who conducted most of the research, observed the\nmotion of gas orbiting the center of the galaxy NGC 4258, also\nknown as Messier 106. After first clocking the orbital velocity of\nthe gas and then measuring shifts in the positions of bright\nwater-vapor clouds in the gas, he applied high-school trigonometry\nto calculate the distance to the galaxy _ and establish what may be\na more accurate scale for estimating cosmic distances.\n\n\n   ``This is the most precise distance measured to a remote\ngalaxy,'' he said at a press conference on Tuesday. The discrepancy\nbetween his results and previous distance scales, he added, ``is\nstatistically significant and it's very intriguing.''\n\n\n   After hearing the report, Dr. Wendy L. Freedman of the Carnegie\nObservatories in Pasadena, Calif., who led the Hubble telescope\nteam measuring the cosmic expansion rate, said the new technique\nwas ``a big step forward in distance measurements.''\n\n\n   Dr. Freedman acknowledged, as she had in reporting her team's\nresults last week, that the largest uncertainty in her calculations\nstemmed from extrapolating galactic distances based on distances to\nthe nearby Large Magellanic Cloud, which have been measured at\n170,000 light-years away. This measurement was based primarily on\nobservations of Cepheid stars, objects of known intrinsic\nluminosity that have acted as cosmic mileposts this century.\n\n\n   But Dr. Freedman was not changing her expansion-rate estimates.\n``I would be happier seeing half a dozen such galaxy measurements\nbefore we say anything,'' she said.\n\n\n   Members of Herrnstein's team said they might be able to make\nsimilar measurements to two more galaxies in another year or two.\nBut finding candidate galaxies with favorable dynamic conditions\nhas not been easy. Of 700 galaxies studied, no more than 22 exhibit\nthe observable conditions required.\n\n\n   For the measurements, astronomers used the Very Long Baseline\nArray, a system of 10 identical dish-shaped 82-foot-diameter\nantennas observing simultaneously and combining their data to give\nthem the viewing power equivalent to a 5,000-mile-wide telescope.\nThe array can thus produce detailed images of objects emitting\nradiation in radio wavelengths.

      "content": "SECOND SIGHT  \n (FOR RELEASE THE WEEK OF JUNE 5, 2000)\n\n\n\n   Astronomers and telescope builders have come up with a plan to\ngive the aging Hubble Space Telescope a new lease on life. Instead\nof building an entirely new space telescope, they propose sending\nup just huge mirrors, and then letting Hubble look through them.\n\n\n   According to Jim Crocker of Johns Hopkins University in\nBaltimore, a feasibility study has shown that it is possible to\nturn the 2.4-meter Hubble into a giant 8-meter space observatory.\n\n\n   ``The cost will be some $250 million,'' Crocker says, ``less\nthan half the cost of building a new space telescope.''\n\n\n   The idea was proposed by Bob Woodruff of Ball Aerospace and\nRoger Angel of the University of Arizona in Tucson. At first,\nCrocker recalls, it sounded ``ridiculous.'' But a study group of\nmore than 20 engineers, set up by Crocker, found no obvious\nshow-stoppers.\n\n\n   ``These people have a lot of experience with Hubble,'' Crocker\nsays. ``If they say it can be done, you can't dismiss that\neasily.''\n\n\n   An upgraded Hubble would be able to see planets orbiting nearby\nstars _ currently these can only be detected indirectly _ and\nsearch for signs of oxygen in their atmospheres. Also, with 10\ntimes as much sensitivity and a fourfold improvement in resolution,\nthe new Hubble could peer back in space and time to the era before\nthe first galaxies were born.\n\n\n   ``The science case is pretty compelling,'' Crocker says.\n\n\n   To build the 8-meter telescope, the team proposes using a spare\nmirror ``blank'' leftover from building the European Southern\nObservatory's four-mirror Very Large Telescope. After polishing the\nparabolic surface, the back would be ground away to leave a\nmeniscus-shaped mirror only 2 millimeters thick and weighing less\nthan 1 ton.\n\n\n   Five thousand actuators on its back would control the shape of\nthe ultra-thin mirror. For launch, it would be cut in three, stowed\nin the cargo bay of the space shuttle, and installed during a\nnumber of spacewalks. Astronaut consultants say the job is\nfeasible, and the mirror could be launched as early as 2006.\n\n\n   But in a recent report from the U.S. National Research Council\non astronomy priorities for the next decade, a review committee led\nby Joe Taylor of Princeton University, N.J., and Chris McKee of the\nUniversity of California in Berkeley says it has ``not recommended\nany new moderate or major missions for space-based ultraviolet or\noptical astronomy for the coming decade.''\n\n\n   The main reason is that infrared wavelengths offer greater\nresearch opportunities and these wavelengths will be well covered\nby the Next Generation Space Telescope, a $500 million observatory\nwith an 8-meter mirror due for launch in 2009 or 2010.\n\n\n   ``The idea is very smart and the team that proposes it has to be\ntaken seriously,'' says Piero Benvenuti, director of the Space\nTelescope European Coordiating Facility in Garching, Germany.\n``But given the current budget situation, both in the United States\nand Europe, I think it will remain an excellent and technically\nextremely interesting academic exercise.'' &QL;\n\n\n   &UR; (This article is excerpted from New Scientist, a weekly science\nand technology magazine based in London.) &LR;  &QC;",

But, until this week,\nBenedict had only seen NGC 4314 in the telescopes of UT's McDonald\nObservatory: an interesting but fuzzy blob of faint yellow and\nblue.\n\n\n   On Thursday, NASA released the powerful Hubble space telescope's\nfirst view of what NGC 4314 really is: a bright yellow jewel in a\nsetting of red and blue gems.The gems are a nursery where stars are\nbeing born around the galaxy's yellow core.\n\n\n   ``Lovely,'' said Benedict by e-mail from San Diego, Calif.,\nwhere he was attending the summer meeting of the American\nAstronomical Society, which will hold its winter meeting in Austin\nin January. ``Not the most exciting picture, but certainly the best\nlooking.''\n\n\n   The photo will be as useful as it is pretty, because it shows\nthe formation of stars with almost as much clarity as can be seen\nin our own Milky Way galaxy.\n\n\n   Unlike the Milky Way, increasingly visible with the unaided eye\nat this time of year as a mass of luminous star clouds across the\neastern sky, NGC 4314 is too far away to see without a telescope.\n\n\n   Benedict and other astronomers will use the Hubble picture and\nadditional Hubble data to modify computer models of star formation,\nmathematical respresentations that aid their understanding.

      "content": "HUBBLE DETECTS ANCIENT GALAXIES \n\n\n\n   The Hubble Space Telescope has succeeded in peering out through\nspace and back through time to find the oldest, most distant\ngalaxies ever seen. The discovery could lead to a better\nunderstanding of the earliest formative stages of the universe,\nastronomers said Thursday.\n\n\n   ``This observation is a major step toward fulfilling one of\nHubble's key objectives: to search for the faintest and farthest\nobjects in the universe,'' said Edward Weiler, the National\nAeronautics and Space Administration's head of space science.\n\n\n   The ancient galaxies apparently are being seen as they were when\nthe universe was only about one-20th of its present age, or much\nless than a billion years old, the astronomers said at a briefing\nat NASA headquarters in Washington. The previously most-distant\ngalaxies ever seen, which were observed by Hubble almost three\nyears ago using a different camera, were estimated to go back to\nabout one-10th of the universe's present age, or more than one\nbillion years after the universe's birth.\n\n\n   The latest pictures were taken by a new camera installed on the\norbiting telescope early last year. Called NICMOS _ the\nNear-Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer _ the camera had\nas one of its main purposes to be able to peer farther out into\nspace by picking up infrared radiation. That's because objects that\nare farther from us are speeding away, and therefore have their\nlight shifted out of the visible range of light and into the\ninfrared, where human eyes can't see it.\n\n\n   Thus, the new camera made it possible ``to extend Hubble's line\nof sight farther out into the universe than we could any other\nway,'' said David Leckrone, NASA's senior Hubble telescope\nscientist. With the new observations, he said, ``that promise has\nbeen fulfilled.''\n\n\n   In the earlier Hubble picture of distant galaxies, called the\nHubble Deep Field, astronomers found that many of the oldest\ngalaxies they could see appeared to be small, fragmentary pieces\nthat lacked the symmetry and elegance of more recent spiral or\nelliptical galaxies.\n\n\n   But the new pictures reveal that at least some of the objects\nthat appeared to be galaxy fragments were simply the brightest\nparts of normal-looking galaxies. The infrared pictures fill in the\nblanks, connecting several of the fragments into a single, normal\nspiral.\n\n\n   ``Some of the images that looked like multiple, small galaxies\nmight be individual pieces of larger galaxies,'' said Lisa\nStorrie-Lombardi of the Carnegie Institution in Pasadena.\n\n\n   Although the most distant galaxies seen in the new picture are\ntoo faint for the astronomers to be able to measure their exact\ndistances, about 10 of them appear to fit the expectations of what\nthe earliest, most distant galaxies should look like, said Rodger\nThompson, an astronomer at the University of Arizona and leader of\nthe team that made the observations.\n\n\n   By continuing to analyze the details in this image, and perhaps\nmaking follow-up observations of some of the newfound galaxies when\nnew, more powerful orbiting telescopes become available, Thompson\nsaid, ``we can put together a much more complete scenario of how\nour universe evolved.''\n\n\n   Astronomers believe they have a good understanding of how the\nuniverse as a whole formed in a great explosion called the Big\nBang, about 12 billion years ago, and also of how billions of\nindividual stars formed within each galaxy. But they do not yet\nhave a clear picture of how the galaxies themselves came into\nbeing. Observations of the earliest stages of galaxy formation\ncould help them to figure out how that process worked.\n\n\n   Alan Dressler, a Carnegie Institution astronomer and specialist\non galaxy formation, called the new observations ``an exciting\nfirst step into the infrared view of the universe.'' The new\npicture, he said, shows ``we were missing something'' in earlier\nobservations, and it is now clear that ``the universe was already\nrelatively well formed quite early on.''\n\n\n   Leckrone said that while it will take more observations with\noth",

Even with leaping\nextrapolations, the task is probably impossible, and the numbers\nbecome, well, astronomical.\n\n\n   Undaunted, astronomers studying new pictures taken by the Hubble\nSpace Telescope announced at a meeting of the American Astronomical\nSociety here Thursday an updated estimate of the number of galaxies\nin the observable universe: 125 billion. As recently as three years\nago, the count was only 50 billion, which was subsequently raised\nto 80 billion.\n\n\n   The new figure reflects not a spurt in galactic births, of\ncourse, but instead an improvement in the Hubble telescope's\nability to peer deep into the universe, back closer to the first\nepoch in which matter coalesced into stars and stars congregated in\nvast galaxies. The new observations have detected some faint\ngalaxies so far away that they were probably formed when the\nuniverse was no more than 1 billion years old, less than 10 percent\nof its current estimated age of some 13 billion years.\n\n\n   Dr. Henry Ferguson, an astronomer at the Space Telescope Science\nInstitute in Baltimore, said the new galaxy estimate was derived\nfrom the Hubble telescope's observations of a small patch of\nsouthern sky taken over a 10-day period in October. The pictures,\ncalled the Hubble Deep Field South, were a sequel to a similar\nsurvey of a part of the northern sky made in late 1995.\n\n\n   The southern survey was able to get a deeper cosmic view because\nof two new instruments that had been added to the Hubble telescope.\nOne is a camera for recording objects seen in near-infrared light;\nit can detect galaxies otherwise obscured by dust. The other\ninstrument was an imaging spectrograph that produced some of the\ndeepest optical pictures ever taken.\n\n\n   The photographs revealed galaxies of all sizes and shapes in a\nnarrow corridor of the sky, reaching back some 12 billion years.\nAstronomers counted 620 galaxies there. The previous survey, which\ncovered a larger section of the northern sky, showed more than\n3,000 galaxies. From these numbers, the Hubble astronomers\nextrapolated a total galaxy population of 125 billion.\n\n\n   Ferguson said the count came as no surprise, because other\nevidence indicates that star and galaxy formation was particularly\nrampant in the early universe.\n\n\n   Astronomers expect the findings to help refine models of galaxy\nformation and evolution through time. And their field of study just\nexpanded, inasmuch as each large galaxy comprises perhaps a billion\nstars.",

The project has been in the works since the mid-1970s.\n\n\n   ``It's been a long road,'' said Chandra program manager Fred S.\nWojtalik. The Chandra telescope, named in honor of India-born\nastrophysicist Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, is ``the baby of quite a\nfew people who have devoted significant parts of a lifetime to\nmaking this happen,'' he said.\n\n\n   The shuttle Columbia was to roar into orbit at 12:36 a.m. with\nEileen Collins at the controls, the first woman astronaut named\ncommander of a shuttle mission. Collins, who will be flying with\nthe heaviest, most expensive cargo ever carried by the shuttle (at\nleast, in unclassified flights), has flown twice before as pilot,\nthe No. 2 position.\n\n\n   This morning, about seven hours after liftoff, a delicate series\nof maneuvers will begin positioning the tractor-trailer-sized\ntelescope for release from the shuttle's payload bay. After\nrelease, as soon as radio communication with the spacecraft is\nestablished, control of the observatory will shift from Houston to\nCambridge.\n\n\n   The telescope will go through some last-minute tests, and then\nlate Wednesday it will be launched into a higher, oval orbit by\nfiring its attached rocket motor.\n\n\n   Once in its higher orbit _ which will reach out as far as 87,000\nmiles above Earth, or a third of the way to the moon, at its\nhighest point _ the telescope will be out of reach of astronauts.\nEven at the low point in its 64-hour orbit, Chandra will be 6,200\nmiles high _ more than 20 times the shuttle's maximum altitude.\n\n\n   The Hubble telescope, by contrast, was designed from the start\nto be serviced and have its various cameras replaced by shuttle\nastronauts. This capability proved crucial when it was discovered\nsoon after launch that Hubble's main telescope mirror had been made\nin the wrong shape, preventing the telescope from focusing\nproperly. The error was fixed by special corrective mirrors\ninstalled on a later shuttle mission.\n\n\n   Because there will be no second chances this time, Wojtalik\nsaid, testing was crucial.\n\n\n   ``Every test we could think of has been completed and completed\nwell,'' he said. ``We've done things far beyond what I would say\nwas normal,'' including having five separate committees check out\nall the plans.\n\n\n   Once in operation, the telescope will provide views of X-rays\ngiven off by objects as close as the planets of our own solar\nsystem, and as distant as the furthest quasars at the fringes of\nthe universe. Its images of these distant objects will be 10 times\nmore detailed, and it will be able to detect objects up to 100\ntimes fainter, than any previous X-ray telescope.\n\n\n   Chandra is expected to provide new information about black\nholes, colliding galaxies, exploding stars, an",

Goldin, the NASA administrator, certainly meant no\ndisrespect for the orbiting telescope, regarded by many as the most\nsuccessful space project of the decade. Its spectacular pictures\nand revealing data from the depths of the universe have stretched\nthe dimensions of wonder for scientists and the public alike. And\nit is still going strong.\n\n\n   Instead, in a June 3 speech to a national meeting of the\nAmerican Astronomical Society here, Goldin was exhorting scientists\nto think expansively and identify new technologies for spacecraft\nand telescopes needed for understanding more about the composition,\nevolution, structure and origin of the universe. He called on them\nto recommend ``visionary goals that will resonate, that will\nexcite, that will carry humanity far, far into the future.''\n\n\n   While he made no specific proposals or immediate promises of\nincreased spending, Goldin offered some ideas to illustrate the\nscope of thinking he had in mind. He challenged scientists to\nconceive of new techniques to search for life on Earthlike planets\naround other stars, and durable, low-cost propulsion systems\ncapable of sending robots there. He imagined robots the size of\nsoft-drink cans with software systems mimicking biological\nprocesses, which would be able to adapt to and deal with\nunanticipated problems and thus evolve into ``intelligent\ninterstellar probes.''\n\n\n   Goldin also spoke of deploying into deep space ``gossamer\ntelescopes'' with mirrors several hundred feet wide (Hubble's is\nless than 8 feet) and arrays of widely separated telescopes capable\nof coordinated observations for even sharper images of the cosmos.\nOther space probes might be able to measure gravitational radiation\nfrom the first microseconds of the universe's creation in the\ntheorized Big Bang. One might even be sent to hover over and obtain\ndirect images of the consuming gravitational forces at regions\nknown as black holes.\n\n\n   The audience of senior astronomers as well as graduate students\njust starting their careers broke into laughter when Goldin,\ndriving home his anticomplacency message, said, ``Too many of you\nare hugging the Hubble Space Telescope.''\n\n\n   It was the knowing laughter that comes from hearing a truth\nexposed. Because of years of budget constraints, astronomers said\nlater, those in the field had stopped dreaming and were clinging to\nwhat they had, dwelling on ways to keep the Hubble operating longer\nor developing a larger version, called the Next Generation Space\nTelescope, for launching in the next decade. The Hubble, deployed\nin 1991, was designed to have a 15-year lifetime.\n\n\n   ``He's telling us it's OK to dream again,'' said Dr. Michael S.\nTurner, University of Chicago astrophysicist.\n\n\n   Some astronomers expressed skepticism.

      "content": "HUBBLE OFFERS GLIMPSE INTO DAWN OF THE UNIVERSE\n\n\n\n   Peering farther back in space and time than ever before, the\nHubble Space Telescope has taken infrared pictures of what may be\nthe most distant objects ever detected, early light from the\ngalactic dawn of the universe.\n\n\n   Astronomers are not sure, but they think some of the faint\nobjects could be galaxies formed in the first billion years of\ncosmic history, or more than 12 billion years ago. If so, they are\ncrossing a new frontier of the cosmos, where they hope to find the\nvery first galaxies and solve the mystery of when and how such\ncongregations of stars emerged out of the formless dark.\n\n\n   ``These images are the deepest images of distant galaxies that\nhave ever been obtained,'' Rodger Thompson, a University of Arizona\nastronomer, said in announcing the new Hubble telescope findings\nThursday.\n\n\n   Alan Dressler, an astronomer with the Carnegie Observatories in\nPasadena, Calif., agreed that the infrared pictures were ``our\nfirst tentative glimpse into the very remote universe.''\n\n\n   Although these may represent ``the first stages of galaxy\nformation,'' Dressler said, the objects are such faint blobs that\n``their true nature can only be explored with the advanced\ntelescopes of the future.'' He was referring, in particular, to the\nmore powerful replacement for the Earth-orbiting Hubble telescope\nthat is being planned for launching in 2007.\n\n\n   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration made the\ninfrared pictures public Thursday at a news conference in\nWashington. A catalog of the observed objects and other research\ndetails will be published soon in The Astronomical Journal.\n\n\n   In January, using its infrared spectrometer-camera, an\ninstrument installed by visiting astronauts in early 1997, the\ntelescope took a 36-hour exposure of a relatively narrow region of\nspace that had previously been examined in visible and ultraviolet\nlight. Three years ago, when the Hubble telescope took a 10-day\nexposure with its visible-light camera of the same field of view,\nastronomers found hundreds of galaxies that had never been seen\nbefore, inspiring them to raise their estimate of the total number\nof galaxies in the observable universe to more than 50 billion from\n10 billion. The Hubble Deep Field, as the visible photography was\nknown, had been until now the deepest view of galaxies.\n\n\n   Cameras sensitive to infrared wavelengths can often penetrate\nthe dust that obscures many of the most distant cosmic phenomena.\nSome of these objects are so far away that their only detectable\nlight is in the infrared wavelengths. Most galaxies radiate more\ninfrared light than visible light.\n\n\n   The more than 300 galaxies in the main infrared picture included\nsome that had been seen before. But the infrared camera revealed\nmany new objects, the reddest and faintest of which may be the\nearliest galaxies ever detected. Astronomers said the distant\ngalaxies seemed to be smaller than those from more recent epochs.\nBut they said it was not yet possible to determine if the galaxies\nwere truly small or whether these were merely the cores of larger\nstructures that could not be seen at these distances.\n\n\n   Thompson, the principal scientist working with the infrared\ninstrument's observations, estimated that the most-distant objects\nin the picture dated back to when the universe was 5 percent of its\npresent age. That age is still a matter of debate, but some of the\nmost recent data and theoretical models indicate that the universe\nbegan about 13 billion years ago.\n\n\n   ``The fact that we have found new objects means we really have\nreached the edge'' of the universe, Thompson said. That is, the\nobservations take astronomers close to the time when matter in the\nearly universe first coalesced into stars and the stars clustered\nin galaxies. How this happened is one of the great unknowns of\nastronomy.\n\n\n   In analyzing the results, Thompson also found that faint red\ngalaxies matched up with compact blue knots of light that had been\nseen in the earlier visible photography of the region.\n\n\n   ``This",

He  \nbased his conclusion on the difference in calculated distance to a \nspecific galaxy using his technique compared with the calculation \nmethod used by the NASA group. \n\n\n\tFreedman and her group of 27 astronomers funded by NASA spent  \neight years measuring the distance to stars that pulsate in \nbrightness at a known rate. Such stars, called Cepheids, are \nconsidered ``standard candles'' whose varying luminosity gives a \ngauge for their distance. \n\n\n\tBut Herrnstein said the technique using Cepheids is far less  \naccurate than his new method that directly measures the motion of \ngas around a galaxy. \n\n\n\tHerrnstein used a galaxy called NGC 4258 to establish what he  \ncalled a ``golden ruler'' for measuring cosmic distances. \n\n\n\tNGC 4258 is surrounded by a rotating cloud of gas. Within this  \ngas cloud is water vapor, which tends to amplify radio signals. \nThis creates radio ``hot spots'' called masers. \n\n\n\tThe orbital speed of masers between NGC 4258 and Earth was  \nmeasured in 1994, and again every few months over the following \nthree years. By determining the speed at which the masers were \nmoving, the astronomers created a triangle with the first maser \nposition at one angle, the latest position at a second angle, and \nthe galaxy center at the third angle. Measuring the angles gives \nthe distance. \n\n\n\t``We can use plain old trigonometry to calculate the distance,''  \nsaid Lincoln Greenhill, a member of the Herrnstein team. \n\n\n\t``It is very simple and direct,'' said Herrnstein. ``Most of us  \nknow enough math from high school to do the calculation.'' \n\n\n\tThe distance to NGC 4258 was calculated at 23.5 million light  \nyears, with an accuracy to within 4 percent. This distance has been \ncalculated using the Cepheid star technique at 27 to 29 million \nlight years. \n\n\n\tHerrnstein said that the distance measure using Cepheid stars is  \nbased on a series of assumed values, such as the distance to the \nLarge Magellanic Cloud, a galaxy neighbor to the Milky Way. These \nassumed values, said Herrnstein, have a greater margin of error \nthan does the direct measuring technique he is using. \n\n\n\tFreedman, who attended a news conference at which Herrnstein  \nannounced his results, said the new study provided ``wonderful \ndata,'' but she would like other measurements to be taken to \nconfirm its accuracy. \n\n\n\tAlso, she said the assumed values used in the Cepheid star  \ntechnique have been",

Initially nearsighted because of a design error, the\nHubble was repaired when a pair of space shuttle astronauts\ninstalled a corrective lens.\n\n\n   Since then, the city bus-sized telescope has radioed to Earth\nmore than 259,000 images, ranging from the surface of the moon to\ndeep space objects.\n\n\n   The images astonished astronomers with their clarity and\nrevealed heavenly details that have rewritten many astronomical\ndisciplines.\n\n\n   The second innovation was a spin-off of former President\nReagan's ``Star Wars'' dream, the Strategic Defense Initiative\n(SDI).\n\n\n   In order to guide the program's huge ground-based lasers, which\nSDI planners hoped would one day zap enemy missiles out of the sky,\nAir Force scientists set out to find a way to overcome the\ndistortions the atmosphere imposes on ground-based observations of\nspace.\n\n\n   These distortions, caused by the fact that the air is not a\nuniform fluid but contains areas of varying density, had plagued\nastronomers for centuries.

In visible light, many of these regions are\nhidden from view by the very clouds of gas and dust enveloping\nthem.\n\n\n   The telescope's other camera and instruments are still operating\nnormally, but its near-infrared camera and multi-object\nspectrometer, a single instrument, ran out of coolant and had to be\nswitched off.\n\n\n   In a service mission scheduled in October, space shuttle\nastronauts are to visit the orbiting observatory to install an\nimproved computer and new set of gyroscopes for stabilizing the\ntelescope. It will be at least another year before a second shuttle\nmission can restore the infrared camera with a new cooling system.\n\n\n   Describing the new pictures, Boeker said that an effort was made\nto snap spiral galaxies at all angles, from the classic face-on\nview of NGC 5653 to the edge-on shot of NGC 891. Other pictures\nshowed close-ups of the hubs of galaxies glowing in white light\nfrom the dense concentration of stars.\n\n\n   For all the pictures, filters introduced false colors to\nhighlight textures and material recorded in infrared wavelengths\nthat would otherwise be invisible to the human eye. Red, for\nexample, corresponds to glowing hydrogen, the raw material of star\nbirth. Blue represents the main galactic structure of spiral arms\ncomposed of young and middle-aged stars. Green is a mixture of the\nred and blue images. The galaxy cores are mostly white because of\ntheir concentrations of stars.\n\n\n   In most cases, astronomers said, red knots in the spiral arms\npinpointed rich star-forming regions. But the glowing hydrogen\ninside the galactic cores, they said, could have several possible\nexplanations. They could reveal star birth or the radiation from\nthe vicinity of massive black holes, or a combination of both.\n\n\n   Though galaxies come in many other shapes, like ellipticals and\ndwarfs, Boeker said that esthetics largely dictated the Hubble's\npicture selection. ``Spirals,'' he said, ``are more beautiful.''",

The co-chairmen of the\ncommittee that wrote the new report are Joseph H. Taylor Jr., a\nPrinceton University astrophysicist and Nobel laureate, and\nChristopher F. McKee, an astrophysicist at the University of\nCalifornia, Berkeley.\n\n\n   At the top of this year's list is an audacious successor to the\norbiting Hubble Space Telescope that would be 100 to 600 times as\nsensitive, two to three times as large, and able to look far more\ndeeply into the low-energy radiation, called the infrared, that\narrives from the young, star-forming universe. Close behind are a\ngiant, ground-based telescope with an eye 100 feet across and a\nfleet of four large spaceborne telescopes working in concert to\ndiscover Earth-like planets.\n\n\n   With a minimum cost of $4.7 billion for instruments that would\nrequire a wide range of new technologies, the recommendations are\nnothing if not daring for fields as abstract as astronomy,\nastrophysics and cosmology.\n\n\n   Assuming that most of those instruments are built, ``we are in a\nposition to ask, `How did the universe begin? How did it evolve\nfrom a soup of elementary particles into the structures that we see\ntoday? Is there life elsewhere in the universe?''' said Dr. Michael\nTurner, chairman of the astronomy and astrophysics department at\nthe University of Chicago and a member of the committee that wrote\nthat report.\n\n\n   Dr. Anneila Sargent, another committee member, who is a\nprofessor of astronomy at the California Institute of Technology\nand director of the Owens Valley Radio Observatory, said the impact\nof many of the discoveries envisioned in the report would be great\nenough to be felt beyond the narrow community of scientists.\n\n\n   ``Everybody, across the spectrum, would agree that if we could\nfind a planet that could support life like on Earth, we would be\nstunned,'' Sargent said. ``It would be the kind of thing that would\nchange our philosophy of the world.''\n\n\n   Writers of the report also had their eye on the cost.\n\n\n   ``I think we've done the best job we can at setting a number\nthat we can live with,'' Taylor said.\n\n\n   A congressional staff member who is knowledgeable about science\nissues said that because the panel members ``do the heavy lifting\nof actually trying to prioritize,'' the report has had much\ninfluence in garnering support for programs in the past.\n\n\n   The survey has also traditionally been well-received at crucial\nagencies like NASA and the National Science Foundation, a fact that\nshould help boost the prospects of the panel's big winner, the Next\nGeneration Space Telescope, or NGST.\n\n\n   ``The first thing it says to me is their top priority is my top\npriority, which is NGST,'' said Dr. Anne Kinney, program director\nfor the Astronomical Search for Origins at NASA's Office of Space\nScience. ``It really helps to hear that that is the number one\npriority of this extremely distinguished group of astronomers.''\n\n\n   The telescope, which Kinney said could be launched by the end of\nthe decade, would cost roughly a billion dollars and involve\ngossamer-like materials that would fold up on launch and be\nunfurled to create a mirror perhaps 20 feet across once th",

In 1995, astronomers aimed\nthe Hubble Space Telescope for 10 days of concentrated observations\nof a single patch of the northern sky.\n\n\n   The long camera exposures, in effect, bored through space and\ntime to produce views filled with thousands of galaxies at various\nages and stages of evolution, some appearing as they existed when\nthe universe was only 10 percent of its current age.\n\n\n   Now comes the sequel, a core sample of the southern sky that\ngives astronomers more spectacular views of galaxies never before\nseen and probably new clues to the history of the universe.\n\n\n   Over a similar 10-day period last month, the Hubble telescope\noperated by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration was\nfocused on a narrow region in the constellation Tucana, near the\nsouth celestial pole. The pictures, called the Hubble Deep Field\nSouth, were made available Monday to astronomers.\n\n\n   ``The southern field promises to be the most studied area of the\nsky over the next five years,'' said Dr. Robert Williams, the\nastronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore\nwho led the observations.\n\n\n   A team of 50 astronomers and data processors has conducted a\npreliminary examination of the pictures and concluded that they\nappear to validate the common assumption that the universe looks\nlargely the same in any direction.\n\n\n   Powerful new telescopes in Australia and Chile will be trained\non the galaxies revealed by the survey and will precisely measure\ntheir distances from Earth and other properties.\n\n\n   The first findings based on the new observations in ultraviolet,\noptical and infrared light are expected to be reported in January\nat a meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Austin, Texas.\n\n\n   At first glance, Williams said, astronomers noted that\ndisk-shaped galaxies seemed to be more common in the southern\nsurvey than in the northern one, and elliptical galaxies less\ncommon. Astronomers said that some of the more spectacular objects,\nwith variegated patterns like marbles, could be two or more\ngalaxies at different distances superimposed on each other. Or,\nthey could be examples of merging galaxies.\n\n\n   The results have raised expectations. The importance of mergers\nin the evolution of galaxies was one of the insights gained from\nthe northern study. Another insight was that galaxies appeared to\ndevelop from the bottom up, not the top down.\n\n\n   That is, they begin as smaller objects, which are prevalent in\nthe early universe, and grow into larger galaxies and groups of\ngalaxies, instead of extraordinarily large structures that break\ninto galaxies.\n\n\n   The survey also showed that star formation seemed to peak seven\nbillion to nine billion years ago, consistent with earlier studies\nof the composition of the intergalactic medium.\n\n\n   Williams said the most significant result of the northern survey\nwas the validation of a technique of using the colors of galaxies,\nas seen through different filters, to estimate their distances from\nEarth. The technique is proving useful in estimating distances of\ngalaxies beyond the range of ground-based telescopes.\n\n\n   The target region for the southern observations was selected\nbecause it incorporated one phenomenon, a quasar, not present in\nthe northern survey. Quasars are extremely distant and bright\nobjects believed to be powered by black holes, those gravitational\nsinks at the cores of many galaxies.\n\n\n   Quasars are like beacons shining through cosmic haze.

He based his conclusion on the difference in calculated \ndistance to a specific galaxy when comparing his technique with the \nmethod used by the NASA group. \n\n\n\tFreedman and her team of 27 astronomers spent eight years  \nmeasuring the distance to stars that pulsate in brightness at a \nknown rate. Such stars, called cepheids, are considered ``standard \ncandles'' whose varying luminosity gives a gauge for their \ndistance. \n\n\n\tBut Herrnstein said the technique using cepheids is far less  \naccurate than his new method that directly measures the motion of \ngas around a galaxy. \n\n\n\tHerrnstein used a galaxy called NGC 4258 to establish what he  \ncalled a ``golden ruler'' for measuring cosmic distances. \n\n\n\tNGC 4258 is surrounded by a rotating cloud of gas. Within this  \ngas cloud is water vapor, which tends to amplify radio signals. \nThis creates radio ``hot spots'' called masers. \n\n\n\tThe orbital speed of masers between NGC 4258 and Earth was  \nmeasured in 1994, and again every few months over the following \nthree years. By determining the speed at which the masers were \nmoving, the astronomers created a triangle with the first maser \nposition at one angle, the latest position at a second angle and \nthe galaxy center at the third angle. Measuring the angles gives \nthe distance. \n\n\n\t``We can use plain old trigonometry to calculate the distance,''  \nsaid Lincoln Greenhill, a member of the Herrnstein team. \n\n\n\t``It is very simple and direct,'' said Herrnstein. ``Most of us  \nknow enough math from high school to do the calculation.'' \n\n\n\tThe distance to NGC 4258 was calculated at 23.5 million  \nlight-years, with an accuracy to within 4 percent. This distance \nhas been calculated using the cepheid star technique at 27 million \nto 29 million light-years. \n\n\n\tHerrnstein said the distance measure using cepheid stars is  \nbased on a series of assumed values, such as the distance to the \nLarge Magellanic Cloud, a galaxy neighbor to the Milky Way. These \nassumed values, said Herrnstein, have a greater margin of error \nthan does the direct measuring technique he is using. \n\n\n\tFreedman, who attended a news conference at which Herrnstein  \nannounced his results, said the new study provided ``wonderful \ndata,'' but she would like other measurements to be taken to \nconfirm its accuracy. \n\n\n\tAlso, she said the assumed values used in the cepheid star  \ntechnique have been verified by a number of researchers and she was \n``confident'' of the results. Freedman admitted, however, that \nuncertainties in her team's results still needed to be checked out. \n\n\n\tHerrnstein conducted his study using the Very Long Basel",

A light year is the distance light travels \nacross space in a year, about 6 trillion miles. \n\n\n\tChandra, the world's largest and most sensitive X-ray telescope,  \nwas launched July 23, and is still undergoing orbital checkout and \ncalibration tests. But officials said the initial images show that \nthe space telescope ``is in excellent health,'' a NASA statement \nsaid. \n\n\n\t``We were astounded by these images,'' Harvey Tananbaum,  \ndirector of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory's Chandra \nX-ray Center in Cambridge, Mass., said in a statement. He said the \nimages show in detail the shock wave racing away from the supernova \ncenter at millions of miles an hour. \n\n\n\t``This observatory is ready to take its place in the history of  \nspectacular scientific achievements,'' Martin Weisskopf, the \nChandra Project Scientist, said in a statement. \n\n\n\tRobert Kirshner, a Harvard University astronomer, said in a NASA  \nstatement that Chandra's ability to make high quality X-ray images \nof the universe ``will have an impact on virtually every area of \nastronomy.'' \n\n\n\tChandra joins NASA's fleet of orbiting observatories that  \ninclude the Hubble Space Telescope, which collects images in \nvisible light, and the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, which studies \ngamma ray emissions in the universe. \n\n\n\tChandra operates from a high orbit, ranging from 6,000 to 86,400  \nmiles above the Earth.

      "content": "ASTRONOMERS CATCH SIGHT OF GALAXIES ABORNING \n\n\n\n   In the beginning, there was light, the bursting dawn of cosmic\ncreation. As the fireball of the Big Bang expanded and cooled,\nthough, the light faded away and darkness fell on the young\nuniverse, by then little more than a formless sea of dark matter\nflecked with traces of primordial hydrogen and helium and broken\nonly by scattered but fateful ripples.\n\n\n   The universe had entered what astronomers characterize as its\ndark age. Over a period from 300,000 years to about half a billion\nyears after the Big Bang the darkness persisted, denying to\nastronomers any direct evidence of this time of momentous\ntransformation. Somehow this epoch gave birth to the architecture\nof the modern universe and conditions that would eventually lead to\nplanets and life.\n\n\n   But what happened in the dark age and how the light came on\nagain is an enduring and frustrating mystery. If there was no light\nor other detectable radiation from the dark age, what was there to\nsee? Besides, no telescope could see back that far. Sir Martin\nRees, a cosmologist at Cambridge University in England, calls this\nthe ``most important unsolved problem in astronomy.''\n\n\n   In spite of the obstacles, by looking deeper and deeper into\nspace and thus into time with new telescopes in Earth orbit and on\nthe ground, astronomers are making progress in their search for the\nfirst light.\n\n\n   They are at last catching sight of some of the earlier, if not\nnecessarily the first, galaxies _ each observation seems to put\ntheir formation back earlier in time. Astronomers are also\ngathering clues to what makes up most of the universe, the\nmysterious dark matter, and how it and other dark-age conditions\ngave birth to the first stars and the first galaxies. The new\nknowledge is enabling scientists to test their theories and conduct\nincreasingly detailed computer simulations of cosmic history,\nincluding the dark age.\n\n\n   The dark age ended when light returned to the firmament with the\nemergence of the first stars and then vast communities of stars\ngravitationally bound in galaxies. ``Suddenly, the universe lit up\nlike a Christmas tree,'' said Dr. Abraham Loeb, a theoretical\nastrophysicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics\nin Cambridge, Mass.\n\n\n   ``Somewhere in the dark age, the transition from the universe's\ninitial simple state to its current complex state occurred,'' Loeb\nsaid. ``It would be philosophically exciting to glimpse that\nmoment.''\n\n\n   A few years ago, Loeb recalled, he was one of a handful of\nscientists studying the dark age and early star formation. But a\nworkshop on the subject at the University of Maryland last week\ndrew several dozen of the top observational and theoretical\nastronomers. ``Now this has become a very hot topic,'' he said.\n\n\n   Two weeks ago, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration\nreleased pictures taken by the Hubble Space Telescope of what\nastronomers think are the most distant galaxies ever studied. These\ngalaxies probably formed in the first billion years of cosmic\nhistory, or more than 12 billion years ago. Such estimates are\nrough because they depend on cosmological models and chronological\nyardsticks based on the universe's being about 13 billion years\nold, which is controversial and subject to revision.\n\n\n   ``We have really made a step into new territory,'' said Dr.\nRodger I. Thompson, a University of Arizona astronomer who directed\nthe observations with the Earth-orbiting Hubble telescope's\nnear-infrared camera and spectrometer.\n\n\n   Only an infrared camera can detect the faintest, most distant\ngalaxies. Dust in deep space obscures most visible light, more so\nthan radiation in the longer infrared wavelengths. And it is a\nphenomenon of the expanding universe that the light emitted by a\ngalaxy gets stretched out to the redder and even near-infrared\nwavelengths. At distances of vanishing visibility, the infrared\ngalactic light becomes the cosmic version of the Cheshire cat's\ngrin.\n\n\n   The more distant galaxies have a higher expansion velocity and\nthus a higher",

Marcella Carollo of Columbia  \nUniversity in New York, concluded that galaxies with small bulges \nand long bars or lines of stars that bisect the nucleus grew more \nrecently and through different processes. \n\n\n\tThe researchers say the central bulge stabilizes a galaxy's  \ndevelopment and largely controls the ebb and flow of star birth in \nthe core. \n\n\n\tThe Hubble telescope allows astronomers, who had previously been  \nable to study only the bulge at the center of our own galaxy, to \npeer deep inside the bulges of other galaxies. \n\n\n\tCarollo's team said the central bulge in the galaxies they  \nstudied probably formed early in the history of the universe, but \nwas later fed by gas flowing into the galaxy's core, caused by \ninstability in the surrounding disk of stars. \n\n\n\tThe gas fueled the birth of new stars, and the bulge grew, with  \nbright star clusters populating the center. They found both young \nand old stars in the bulge. \n\n\n\tPeletier's researchers studied the center of 20 spiral galaxies  \nthat have large bulges. They concluded that elliptical bulges of \nstars formed over a relatively brief period very early in the young \nuniverse, either through the collapse of a single cloud of hydrogen \nor the merger of primeval star clusters. \n\n\n\t``The bulges of early spiral galaxies are old, and at least the  \nouter parts of their disks are considerably younger,'' Peletier \nsaid in a statement. \n\n\n\tThe groups used Hubble telescope to study more than 200  \nneighboring galaxies, out to a distance of 100 million light years. \nA light year is the distance light travels in a year. \n\n\n\tUsing visible light and infrared cameras, they were able to  \ndetermine the stars' true colors. Older stars tend to be redder, \nbut space dust can interfere with color perception from Earth. The \nHubble space telescope permitted the researchers to look past that \ndust. \n\n\n\tPeletier's report is scheduled for publication in Monthly  \nNotices of the Royal Astronomical Society and Carollo's work will \nappear in Astrophysical Journal.",

Astronomers express the Hubble constant by measuring the \nacceleration rate for every 3.26 million light years in distance. \n\n\n\tCalculations using ground telescopes have ranged up to 558, but  \nFreedman said new measurements taken with the space telescope have \nrefined the acceleration rate to 70 kilometers per second. This \nmeans that a galaxy is moving 160,000 miles per hour faster for \nevery 3.3 light years it is away from the Earth. Freedman said her \nfigure was accurate within 10 percent. \n\n\n\tSandage said NASA's new number is still too high.  \n\n\n\t``We've said all along that the correct number is about 55,'' he  \nsaid. This would give an age of the universe of 14 to 18 billion \nyears, depending on what is assumed about the mass in the universe, \nSandage said. \n\n\n\tThe expanding universe supports the Big Bang theory, the idea  \nthat the universe began when all matter was compressed into a \nsingle point that then exploded. The theory states that the \nuniverse has been expanding ever since. \n\n\n\tRecent studies have shown that the universe probably will expand  \nforever. Some researchers also believe the expansion is speeding up \ndue to a force that accelerates matter. Whether this force exists \nis still a matter of controversy. \n\n\n\tFreedman said the age of the universe will finally be determined  \nwhen other researchers have more precisely measured the mass and \nthe effect of the mysterious force. \n\n\n\tThe NASA team reached its Hubble constant number by measuring  \nthe distance to a type of star, called a Cepheid, that pulsates at \na known rate and strength. By measuring Cepheids in 18 galaxies out \nto 65 million light years, Freedman said, the team established the \nrate of expansion. \n\n\n\tSandage said his team measured distances to nine star  \nexplosions, called supernovae, and then confirmed those distances \nwith Cepheid measurements. He said this method is more accurate. \n\n\n\tBoth teams used the Hubble Space Telescope, which can study  \nstellar detail that is unseen by ground telescopes. \n\n\n\tDespite the difference in numbers, Robert Kirshner of Harvard,  \nhead of a third team studyin",

The instrument detected about 100\ngalaxies that were not seen in the visible light and 10 of these\nwere at extreme distance.\n\t   He said the galaxies are seen as they were when the universe was\nonly about five percent of its present age. Astronomers generally\nbelieve the universe began with a massive explosion, called the\n``big bang'', that occurred about 13 billion years ago.\n\t   Since the big bang, astronomers believe that galaxies are moving\nrapidly away from each other, spreading out and becoming more\ndistant. For this reason, distance and time can be measured\ntogether. Light from the distant objects traveled for about 12\nbillion years before being detected by Hubble.\n\t   Infrared radiation cannot be seen by the eye, but it is the most\ncommon type of light from distant galaxies. For this reason, said\nThompson, the infrared instrument could detect galaxies that were\ninvisible to earlier Hubble studies.\n\t   Thompson said that a more advanced space telescope, now in the\nplanning stages by NASA, will be needed to absolutely confirm the\ndistance and age of these faint objects.\n\t   ``We can see the objects clearly, but we can't get their age for\nsure,'' said Thompson.\n\t   ``This is an exciting first step into this distant universe,''\nsaid Alan Dressler, a Carnegie astronomer who was not a member of\nthe observing team. ``We're looking for zero (a time before stars\nand galaxies had formed) and we haven't found it yet.''",

Marcella Carollo of Columbia University  \nin New York, concluded that galaxies with small bulges and long \nbars or lines of stars that bisect the nucleus grew more recently \nand through different processes. \n\n\n\tThe researchers say the central bulge stabilizes a galaxy's  \ndevelopment and largely controls the ebb and flow of star birth in \nthe core. \n\n\n\tThe Hubble telescope allows astronomers, who had previously been  \nable to study only the bulge at the center of our own galaxy, to \npeer deep inside the bulges of other galaxies. \n\n\n\tCarollo's team said the central bulge in the galaxies they  \nstudied probably formed early in the history of the universe, but \nwas later fed by gas flowing into the galaxy's core, caused by \ninstability in the surrounding disk of stars. \n\n\n\tThe gas fueled the birth of new stars, and the bulge grew, with  \nbright star clusters populating the center. They found both young \nand old stars in the bulge. \n\n\n\tPeletier's researchers studied the center of 20 spiral galaxies  \nthat have large bulges. They concluded that elliptical bulges of \nstars formed over a relatively brief period very early in the young \nuniverse, either through the collapse of a single cloud of hydrogen \nor the merger of primeval star clusters. \n\n\n\t``The bulges of early spiral galaxies are old, and at least the  \nouter parts of their disks are considerably younger,'' Peletier \nsaid in a statement. \n\n\n\tThe groups used Hubble telescope to study more than 200  \nneighboring galaxies, out to a distance of 100 million light years. \nA light year is the distance light travels in a year. \n\n\n\tUsing visible light and infrared cameras, they were able to  \ndetermine the stars' true colors. Older stars tend to be redder, \nbut space dust can interfere with color perception from Earth. The \nHubble space telescope permitted the researchers to look past that \ndust. \n\n\n\tPeletier's report is scheduled for publication in Monthly  \nNotices of the Royal Astronomical Society and Carollo's work will \nappear in Astrophysical Journal.",

      "content": "HUBBLE PHOTOS SHED NEW LIGHT ON BIRTH OF PLANETS \n\n\n\n   Photographs from the Hubble Space Telescope are providing a\npicture of how the Earth's solar system formed, helping to confirm\nastronomers' theories of how planets are born, astronomers report.\n\n\n   None of the pictures actually show planets, which are too faint\nto be seen at even the distances of the nearest stars. But they do\nshow swirling disks of gas and dust around newborn stars, in some\ncases with gaps or holes in the disks that seem to show the effects\nof planets. Astronomers believe that all planets, including Earth,\noriginally formed from such disks.\n\n\n   The Hubble images, showing young stars at various stages in the\nearly formation of planets, can be assembled into a sequence that\nshows how the process unfolds, the astronomers said this week at a\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration briefing.\n\n\n   Though the stars differ somewhat in size from our sun, these\nimages of the various embryonic stages of planet formation may be\nthe closest thing we will ever have to baby pictures of our solar\nsystem in its formative years, the astronomers said.\n\n\n   ``We now have an assembly of pictures that span almost the\nentire evolutionary sequence'' of the sun and its planets, said\nSteven Beckwith, director of the Space Telescope Science Institute\nin Baltimore.\n\n\n   Most of the new pictures were taken of one of the nearest\ninterstellar clouds where stars are being born, in the\nconstellation of Taurus. These stars, imaged by astronomer Deborah\nPadgett and her colleagues using a camera on the Hubble telescope\nthat picks up infrared light, are about 450 light years (or about\n2.7 quadrillion miles) from Earth. Most of the images show dark\nbands cutting through the bright image of a star, because the dusty\ndisks are seen edge-on from Earth's perspective.\n\n\n   The pictures provide strong support for theories of planet\nformation which were formulated decades ago, long before\nastronomers thought that it would be possible to see such processes\nin action anytime in the foreseeable future. ``It's a good example\nof a theory that's been around for a long time, but we were only\nable to check it in recent years,'' Beckwith said.\n\n\n   Surveys of nearby regions of space where stars are forming from\nlarge gas clouds seem to show that the vast majority of stars _ and\nperhaps virtually all of them _ are surrounded by such\n``protoplanetary disks'' early in their lifetimes. This is good\nnews for those who hope to find signs of intelligent beings out\namong the stars, because it suggests that most stars will\nultimately be found to have planets _ presumed to be the likeliest\nplace to find life.\n\n\n   Still, since none of the actual planets in such systems can yet\nbe seen, the astronomers cautioned that it is too soon to be sure\nwhat the pictures mean. David Leckrone, senior NASA scientist for\nthe Hubble project, said that ``it's a good halftime score, but the\ngame isn't over yet.''\n\n\n   And Beckwith added ``until we can actually see the planets, we\nwon't know for sure.'' Still, he said, the images are good news for\nthe theorists because they fit the expected picture. The proof may\nrequire direct detection of planets, he said. But in the meantime,\nwhile it may be possible to come up with alternative explanations\nfor some individual pictures, other than current ideas about the\nbirth of planetary systems ``there isn't any other theory that\ncould account for this whole range of observations.''",

Throw it out? Donate it to a school? Cannibalize it\nfor parts? Or, you could do as NASA does, and store it in an inert\nnitrogen envelope in a corner of the world's largest clean room.\n\n\n   The Hubble Space Telescope's DF-224 will be the world's most\nexpensive obsolete computer when astronauts bring it back from the\ntelescope later this month. Although the old computer, Hubble's\noriginal, isn't necessarily all that expensive in-and-of itself,\nits launch to orbit and return cost roughly $1.8 million. (NOTE TO\nEDITORS: NASA VERY ROUGH ESTIMATE OF LAUNCH COSTS &QC; $9,000/LB. WEIGHT\nOF OLD COMPUTER &QC; 100 LBS. 9,000 $/LB x 100 LB x 2 FLIGHTS  &QC; \n$1,800,000)\n\n\n   As a result, NASA is reluctant to simply throw the thing away.\n\n\n   ``Engineers by nature are kind of pack rats,'' said Preston\nBurch, the project manager for HST Operations. ``If you ever came\nto my office, it would scare you.''\n\n\n   Burch has racks of 'junk' stored at his facility, which he takes\nout now and then to fiddle with for testing and diagnostic reasons.\n\n\n   Normally, anything that comes back from Hubble is examined\nclosely and often recycled for reuse. This is the third servicing\nmission to the telescope, and astronauts have brought back old\ncomponents on each earlier flight. These obsolete and often broken\npieces of equipment are some of the only objects ever returned to\nEarth from an extended stay in orbit.\n\n\n   ``Outer space is one of the greatest long-term storage\nenvironments there is,'' Burch said. ``There's not any dirt to get\non it, there's no one to get one of their greasy hands on it.''\n\n\n   NASA recycles what it can. For instance, a previous crew\ninstalled the Wide Field Planetary Camera 2, the workhorse\ninstrument that takes most pictures from Hubble, and ferried the\nfirst model back to Earth. The first camera has been stripped and\nremodeled, and will go back to orbit next year as 'WFPC3.'\n\n\n   ``If it's an instrument and it's coming back and it's in\nperfectly good shape, we'll send it to another contractor,'' Burch\nsaid. ``We'll definitely want to use the flight structure and the\nlatches, and maybe the optical bench - that's a structure that's\ndesigned to be very rigid that holds all of the optical\ncomponents...it has to be very precise.''\n\n\n   But Hubble is ten years old, and has been very busy. Some parts\nhave ``degraded'' as NASA says, like the stabilizing gyroscopes the\ncurrent Discovery crew is replacing. Wires inside the gyroscope\nhave corroded because of exposure to oxygen and are now, well,\njunk.\n\n\n   Burch wants them back anyway.\n\n\n   ``Usually we're replacing the originals because they failed,''\nBurch said. ``And one of the things we want to know is why it\nfailed.''\n\n\n   Before they get components back from orbit, NASA's engineers are\noften pressed to find out what went wrong with a part by reading\nall the telemetry from the satellite, so that they can re-design\nthe part. When the part comes back, the staff at NASA Goddard\ncenter likes to test their earlier hypotheses.\n\n\n   When they're done inspecting, dissecting, and rejecting the\npart, it goes into storage. NASA staff like to keep it around to\nhelp them diagnose problems with new parts, Burch said. If one of\nthe new gyroscopes starts showing a problem, for instance,\nengineers will haul out the old ones to see if they can make it\nbehave the same way in a lab.\n\n\n   Goddard has the largest clean room of its kind in the world,\nneeded to build the Hubble, and has plenty of space. Failing that,\nBurch said, engineers can seal the part in a plastic container with\ndry nitrogen - all water vapor removed - to prevent corrosion.\n\n\n   ``The very last thing we'd ever do is throw it in the\ndumpster,'' Burch said.\n\n\n   The old computer, however, is ``a different animal,'' he said.\nIt's not dumpster-bound, but it's not something Burch even really\nneeds to look at.

They\ncannot be seen by optical telescopes because they are camouflaged\nby dust that is characteristic of galaxies in their early stages of\ndevelopment.\n\t   Researchers say the discoveries by astronomers at the University\nof Edinburgh Royal Observatory in Scotland and the University of\nHawaii show that sections of the deep sky that had appeared empty\nactually might be crammed with thousands of these bright objects,\neach of which might contain billions of hot, young stars. In fact,\nthese starburst galaxies may be as common as all of the space\nobjects spotted by optical telescopes.\n\t   The discoveries demonstrate that astronomers may have been\nmissing a vital, formative period in the history of the universe.\n\t   The deeper astronomers peer into space, the farther back in time\nthey are looking. It takes so long for light from a star to reach\nEarth that astronomers peering toward the far edges of space are\nseeing objects as they were billions of years ago.\n\t   With potentially so many young starburst galaxies out there,\nastronomers may have been drastically underestimating when galaxies\nstarted forming and the rate at which they formed.\n\t   Up to now, astronomers believed a peak period of galaxy\nformation occurred when the universe was 8 billion to 10 billion\nyears old. (The universe is thought to be 13 billion to 15 billion\nyears old.)\n\t   But this newly observed burst of galaxy formation may have\noccurred much earlier _ perhaps when the universe was less than 2\nbillion years old.\n\t   ``The question as to exactly how far back in time this has taken\nplace still has some uncertainty associated with it,'' said Robert\nWilliams, director of the Space Telescope Science Institute in\nBaltimore. ``However, the basic interpretation should be correct.''\n\t   Also, this stellar baby boom may have peaked at a rate five to\n100 times greater than previously estimated, the researchers said.\n\t   The findings may prompt astronomers to rewrite some early\nchapters in the story of the universe.\n\t   ``Early, rapid star formation implies that the very first\nobjects might have had to form much earlier still,'' said Douglas\nScott, an astronomer at the University of British Columbia.\n\t   The studies were conducted in 1997-98 with the Submillimeter\nCommon-User Bolometer Array, or SCUBA. The instrument, developed by\nthe University of Edinburgh, is mounted on a 15-meter telescope at\nthe Mauna Kea observatory in Hawaii.\n\t   SCUBA has detectors that make the most rapid and extensive\nmeasurements of invisible far-infrared light from deep space. The\nvery dust that obscures the young galaxies absorbs heat from the\nnew stars and re-radiates it in faint, longer wavelengths that\nSCUBA picks up.\n\t   The Royal Observatory scanned a portion of the sky known as the\nHubble Deep Field.\n\t   Astronomers used the Hubble Space Telescope in 1995 to zero in\non that region, which was thought to be a dull cosmic neighborhood.\nAs it turned out, the Hubble, using a regular optical telescope and\nother instruments, found more than 3,000 galaxies, each containing\n10 billion stars.\n\t   The Royal Observatory astronomers used SCUBA to look even deeper\ninto that portion of the sky and detected even more galaxies.\n\t   The other study, conducted by astronomer Amy Barger of the\nUniversity of Hawaii and seven collaborators, including four from\nJapan, used SCUBA to look at other patches of the sky.",

Astronomers have long\nhoped to find a multiple-planet system other than our own, because\nstudying such systems could help to reveal more about the process\nof how planets form, and show that our sun's family is not unique.\n\n\n   The only multiple planets found before were orbiting the\nburned-out remnants of dead stars, called pulsars, and are thought\nto have been formed by completely different processes than normal\nplanets. Furthermore, they are in hellish environments of high\ntemperature and radiation that preclude any possibility of life _\none of the main reasons astronomers are interested in finding other\nplanets in the first place.\n\n\n   The ring gives the star in Libra an appearance very much like\nthat of the ringed planet Saturn in our own solar system, and\nastronomer Bradley Smith of the University of Hawaii said at a\nmeeting of the American Astronomical Society that the ring around\nthe star HR4796A almost certainly formed in the same way as one of\nSaturn's narrow outer rings.\n\n\n   Those rings are held in place by two moons orbiting very close\nto them, one just inside the ring and one just outside. Without\nthese ``shepherding'' moons, the rings would quickly spread out\ninto a broad disk.\n\n\n   In the same way, Smith said Friday, there is no known way a\nnarrow ring of small particles around another star could exist\nwithout the presence of a pair of sheperding planets _ even though\nthe planets themselves cannot yet be seen in these Hubble images.\n\n\n   Geoffrey Marcy, the University of California at San Francisco\nastronomer who has discovered or co-discovered most of the planets\nbeyond the sun that have been found so far, agreed Friday that\n``when you see rings, something has to confine those rings.'' That\nsomething, according to the Hubble team, must be planets, because\nanything larger would certainly have been visible in the pictures.\n\n\n   Several other stars have been found in recent years to be\nsurrounded by disks of dust and gas, but this is the first case of\na ring around another sun _ and thus the first clear evidence for\nplanets ever found in this way.\n\n\n   Other planets of nearby stars have been discovered by analyzing\nthe motions of the stars themselves to see the telltale wobbles in\ntheir motions caused by the gravitational pull of planets. And the\nexistence of one planet was inferred around a star called Beta\nPictoris because of a warping seen in a disk of gas that surrounds\nthat star.\n\n\n   The new pictures were taken by a camera called NICMOS, or\nNear-Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer, installed on\nthe Hubble telescope during its last servicing mission by space\nshuttle astronauts.\n\n\n   Another picture taken by NICMOS as part of the same series of\nimages of stars in search of dust disks also provides evidence for\na planet. In this case, the planet is revealed by the presence of a\ndark gap in an otherwise continuous disk of dust surrounding the\nstar, suggesting that a planet has swept clean a path through the\ndisk. This apparent planet was found by a team of astronomers at\nthe University of California at Los Angeles.\n\n\n   And four other stars whose pictures were taken by NICMOS also\nshow signs of the influence of planets, but the astronomers have\nnot yet had time to study these closely and could not yet provide\nany details.\n\n\n   Smith said that astronomers had known that it might be possible\nfor such a narrow ring of debris to be found around another star,\nbut he said that ``we knew it could exist, but we didn't really\nexpect to see it.''\n\n\n   The star in question i",

      "content": "SCIENTISTS CALL PHOTOS FROM SPACE OBSERVATORY `ASTOUNDING' \n\n\n\n\n   Astronomers displayed the first images taken by NASA's $1.55\nbillion Chandra X-ray Observatory on Thursday, declaring the new\ntelescope in perfect working order and the picture quality\n``astounding.''\n\n\n   ``It works. It works perfectly. It meets all of our\nspecifications,'' said Ed Weiler, NASA's associate administrator\nfor space science. ``We have the most powerful X-ray observatory in\nthe world.''\n\n\n   The first pictures included:\n\n\n   _ An immense sizzling interstellar cloud left by a star 10,000\nlight years away that exploded 320 years ago. Detected for the\nfirst time amid the remnant gases of Cassiopeia A is a small bright\nobject that may be the dense neutron star produced in the\nexplosion.\n\n\n   _ A quasar 6 billion light years away. Astronomers believe the\nlarge black hole it harbors is responsible for the fierce,\nhigh-velocity gas jet streaking from the object across a distance\ntwice as wide as the Milky Way galaxy.\n\n\n   Nine years ago, Weiler had the unpleasant duty of disclosing\nthat the Hubble Space Telescope had been launched with a misshapen\nmirror, corrected three years later by spacewalking astronauts.\n\n\n   This time, there was nothing but praise for Chandra, a sister of\nthe Hubble. It was launched in July to study the high energy X-ray\nemissions from stellar explosions, galactic collisions and black\nholes.\n\n\n   ``It's really astounding,'' said Harvey Tananbaum, director of\nthe Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory's Chandra X-ray Center in\nCambridge, Mass., noting the images of Cassiopeia were taken in\nless than 90 minutes. ``It's just a glimpse, a first look at the\nkinds of things that Chandra will be able to see. We couldn't be\nmore delighted.''\n\n\n   The 45-foot long telescope was launched July 22 aboard the\nshuttle Columbia, whose five-member crew was led by Air Force Col.\nEileen Collins, the first woman spacecraft commander.\n\n\n   It was deployed by the shuttle crew less than 200 miles above\nthe Earth, then a combination of propulsion devices lofted the big\ntelescope into a looping orbit.\n\n\n   The trajectory takes the telescope as far as 86,500 miles from\nthe Earth, or about a third of the way to the moon.\n\n\n   The unusual orbit places the telescope above the Earth's Van\nAllen radiation belt, which would interfere with the observations.\n\n\n   The protective door over the barrel of the telescope was opened\nin response to remote commands Aug. 12 and the images displayed\nThursday were taken about a week ago.\n\n\n   Astronomers have not had the opportunity to scrutinize them with\nthe same diligence they will apply to the observations that follow.\n\n\n   When they aimed the telescope at the distant quasar as part of a\ncalibration exercise, they expected only to see a bright point of\nlight. The fine resolution came as a surprise.\n\n\n   Chandra was designed for at least five years of observations.\nHowever, it is in an orbit stable enough to afford a 30- to 50-year\nlifetime, officials said.\n\n\n   X-ray astronomy is a field born of the Space Age. The Earth's\natmosphere blocks the harmful form of radiance from reaching\nground-based observatories.\n\n\n   Chandra is the third of NASA's series of great observatories.\nThe Compton Gamma Ray Observatory joined the Hubble in orbit in\n1991. The last in the series, the Space Infrared Telescope\nFacility, is planned for launching in 2001.\n\n\n   &QL; \nXXXX END OF STORY &QL;",

(AP) -- The world's heftiest, mightiest,  \npriciest X-ray telescope is about to embark on a five-year voyage \nto stare deep into the hearts of galaxies and search for signs of \nblack holes. \n\n\n\tThe Chandra X-ray Observatory, a 4 1/2-story colossus stuffed into  \nspace shuttle Columbia and due to lift off Tuesday, is 10 to 100 \ntimes more powerful than any of the dozen or so X-ray telescopes \npreviously placed in orbit. \n\n\n\tIf words glimmered in X-rays, Chandra could read a newspaper  \nfrom a half-mile away or make out the letters of a stop sign from \n12 miles away. \n\n\n\t``We can make Superman jealous, I guess, with our X-ray  \nvision,'' NASA manager Ken Ledbetter says with a smile. \n\n\n\tThe astronauts, led by NASA's first female space shuttle  \ncommander, Eileen Collins, will release Chandra with the flick of a \nswitch seven hours after launch. It will be another month before \nthe telescope's eagerly awaited observations begin. \n\n\n\tX-rays are produced by quasars, galaxies, remnants of exploded  \nstars and other celestial objects, but are invisible to \nground-based telescopes. \n\n\n\tThey would go right through flat mirrors, like those used to  \nfocus light on the Hubble Space Telescope, or the lenses used in \nmany smaller telescopes, so Chandra uses conical mirrors. The \nX-rays will glance off the sloping glass at a shallow angle like \npebbles skipping across a pond. \n\n\n\t``This is an age that we live in where superlatives are used in  \neverything from sports to politics, probably a little bit too \nmuch,'' says Martin Weisskopf, a NASA scientist who has been \nworking on the project for two decades. ``But I can't help but use \nthose superlatives with this observatory. They are really well \nbased.'' \n\n\n\tThe telescope, built by TRW Inc., cost $1.5 billion to develop.  \nThrow in the shuttle ride and five years of orbital operations, and \nthe price jumps to $2.8 billion, making it one of NASA's most \nexpensive science projects ever. \n\n\n\tChandra -- named for the late astrophysicist who won a Nobel  \nPrize -- is the third of NASA's four so-called Great Observatories. \nThe first was Hubble and the second was the Compton Gamma Ray \nObservatory, launched in 1991. \n\n\n\tWith Chandra's help, astronomers hope to learn how much  \nso-called dark matter is out there and where it is, and more about \nthe matter swirling into black holes and the high-energy jets of \nmatter shooting away from them. They also hope to better calculate \nthe distance to celestial objects, useful in estimating the size \nand age of the universe. \n\n\n\tChandra should have flown last summer, but was sidelined by bad  \ncircuit boards and other problems. \n\n\n\tAlso causing heartburn for NASA in recent months has been the  \nrocket motor that's attached to Chandra, because it is similar to \none that malfunctioned on an Air Force satellite in April and left \nthat spacecraft in a worthless orbit. \n\n\n\tThe solid-rocket motor is needed to propel Chandra from the  \nrelatively low altitude of the shuttle into a lopsided orbit with a \nlow point of 6,200 miles and a high point of 87,000 miles -- \none-third of the way to the moon. \n\n\n\tChandra, the rocket motor and support gear together weigh 50,000  \npounds, making it the heaviest shuttle payload ever. \n\n\n\tNASA officials say they're confident the thoroughly checked  \nmotor -- and the telescope itself -- will work. \n\n\n\tHubble was launched in 1990 with a flawed mirror that blurred  \nits vision. It took millions of dollars and a daring space shuttle \nmission to correct Hubble's eyesight, now the envy of the world. \n\n\n\tRigorous testing of Chandra's fully assembled optics uncovered  \nno flaws, says NASA's top space scientist, Ed Weiler. \n\n\n\tStill not satisfied, Weiler just a few months ago asked a favor  \nof the director of the Chandra X-ray Observatory Center in \nCambridge, Mass. \n\n\n\t``Come up with the grossest, most outlandish problems that you  \ncan think of and then make a list and go look at them and make sure \nthat they're not there,'' Weiler asked.",

NASA officials said Wednesday that the launch is off \nuntil at least the end of July. \n\n\n\tNASA wants to wait until the Air Force's investigation is  \ncomplete before proceeding with the Chandra launch. The mission \nalready is a year late because of bad circuit boards that had to be \nreplaced in the telescope and other problems. \n\n\n\tEach month's delay costs NASA $6 million to $8 million, said  \nagency spokesman Dave Drachlis. \n\n\n\tEarlier this month, the Air Force impounded the upper-stage  \nmotor intended for the telescope.

I'm just happy that we pulled this mission off. We still \nhave a few more days, so the pressure isn't off yet. But we've got \na bunch of happy people up here.'' \n\n\n\tThe telescope release went flawlessly, unlike the shuttle's  \n8 1/2-minute climb to orbit seven hours earlier. A short circuit five \nseconds into the flight knocked out a controller on two of the \nthree main engines; backup controllers immediately took over on the \nengines. \n\n\n\tCollins, an Air Force colonel, said she felt ``very confident''  \nthroughout liftoff, in large part because the problem resembled \nwhat had been thrown at her during practice sessions on the ground \nin the months and years leading up to the flight. \n\n\n\tThe electrical problem is not expected to affect the rest of the  \nfive-day shuttle mission, Collins said. Columbia is set to land at \nKennedy Space Center in Florida late Tuesday. \n\n\n\tThe smaller, onboard imaging system being used by Hawley, an  \nastronomer as well as an astronaut, is considered a complement to \nlarger observatories like Chandra and the Hubble Space Telescope \nbecause of its ability to look at objects close to the sun. \n\n\n\tThe system was first used in August 1997 to capture more than  \n400,000 images of the Hale-Bopp comet, which the Hubble could not \nobserve at times because the sun's glare obscured it. \n\n\n\tThough less sensitive than the Hubble, the ultraviolet system  \nalso has a field of view about 30 times wider than its bigger \ncousin. \n\n\n\tOver the course of Columbia's mission, Hawley is expected to  \ngather images of Mercury, Venus and Earth's moon. He is also set to \nuse the telescope-camera to search for evidence of vulcanoids, a \nbelt of small, asteroid-like bodies which scientists believe \nencircles Mercury. \n\n\n\tMeanwhile, ground controllers finished powering up Chandra's  \ninstruments late Friday. Next up for the 45-foot telescope is a \nsmall rocket burn tonight to adjust its orbit, the first of several \nsuch corrections over the next nine days. \n\n\n\tAfter three to four weeks of instrument calibrations, Chandra  \nwill transmit its first images back to Earth.",

      "content": "Astronomers capturing images from the Hubble Space telescope\nhave detected a monstrous cyclone raging over a vast area of Mars,\nand they predicted &LR;  that more storms are likely to develop now that\nMartian summertime is warming the planet's northern hemisphere.\n\n\n   The storm system near the North Pole of Mars covered an area\nfour times larger than the state of Texas, the astronomers said _\nbut because the upper atmosphere of Mars is so thin, it apparently\nkicked up little, if any, dust from the surface.\n\n\n   The fierce storm was first detected April 27 and continued to\nblow for at least three days, said Jim Bell, the Cornell University\nastronomer who led the team that tracked it. Bell observed it again\nsix hours after the telescope transmitted the first sign of the\nstorm, and it seemed to be already dissipating, he said in an\ninterview Wednesday.\n\n\n   The Hubble telescope flies in Earth orbit at an altitude of 300\nmiles, but despite its superb ability to observe planets, stars and\ngalaxies at high resolution, it cannot determine the speed of a\nwindstorm. Bell estimated that at its height, the cyclone's winds\nmust have been swirling at 200 miles an hour or more.\n\n\n   Analysis of the storm cloud's spectrum indicated that the winds\nwere composed of clouds of water ice like similar storm systems on\nEarth. The water originated in the ice cap of the North Pole, and\napparently rose after the frozen carbon dioxide that makes up most\nof the cap had dissipated as the planet warmed under the summer\nsun.\n\n\n   Warming is only relative, however, because the surface\ntemperature of the polar cap is now roughly a frigid 9 degrees\nFahrenheit, although the temperature of the upper atmosphere where\nthe storm winds blow is a far colder 100 degrees below zero, Bell\nsaid.\n\n\n   The large difference in temperature between the polar cap and\nthe planet's summertime upper atmosphere is what probably created a\nlow-pressure vortex, with rising air causing clouds to form _ a\nphenomenon similar to hurricanes on Earth, the Hubble scientists\nsaid.\n\n\n   The huge cyclone, they noted, was very different from the dust\nstorms that frequently rage over the surface of Mars. Dust storms\nwere first observed by the Mariner 9 spacecraft in 1971 when one\nviolent cloud of sandy dust obscured the view from the orbiting\nspacecraft's cameras and took more than three weeks to settle.\n\n\n   In 1977, the Pathfinder spacecraft on Mars also encountered\nbrief sandstorms, but weather instruments atop its slender mast\nclocked the surface winds at only 20 miles an hour.\n\n\n   The Viking orbiter spacecraft of 1976, which maintained contact\nwith two Mars landers on the surface in a vain search for evidence\nof living organisms, also detected three cyclonic windstorms in the\nMartian atmosphere, but the recent huge windstorm that Bell and his\nteam discovered was at least three times larger, he said.\n\n\n   The newest cyclone's ``eye'' was nearly 200 miles in diameter.\nThe entire storm covered an area nearly 1,100 miles across and 900\nmiles long _ larger than the entire North polar ice cap itself,\nBell said. The planet should see more similar storms over the next\nfew months during the Martian summer, he said. &LR;",

All four astronauts have been in\ntraining since mid-1998 for a Hubble servicing mission that had\nbeen scheduled for June 2000.\n\n\n   However, without an expedited visit by a shuttle repair crew,\nNASA could be forced to call a halt to Hubble observations, said Ed\nWeiler, NASA's chief space scientist. Those observations have\nincluded faint galaxies on the frontiers of the universe, stellar\nnurseries, black holes and other mysterious objects that have\nbecome the hallmark of Hubble activities for the past nine years.\n\n\n   The spin of the gyroscopes enables the telescope's computers and\nother electronics to accurately point the telescope. Weiler and\nothers responsible for the 13-ton, five-story observatory stressed\nthat the spacecraft is in no danger of drifting away or plunging\nthrough the atmosphere.\n\n\n   ``This is not a so-called spacecraft emergency,'' Weiler said.\n``We think of this as more of a science emergency.''\n\n\n   At least three of the gyroscopes must spin to maintain the\nthree-dimensional reference in space required by the telescope to\npoint precisely.\n\n\n   Two gyroscopes have failed since the most recent visit to the\nthe telescope by shuttle astronauts in February 1997. A third\ngyroscope faltered Jan. 25, and has been placed in a standby mode,\nleaving the minimum needed for observations.\n\n\n   Telescope engineers calculate an 80 percent likelihood of a\nfourth failure if the National Aeronautics and Space Administration\nwaits until mid-2000 to send a shuttle crew.\n\n\n   Experts have traced the problem to breaks in the two hair-thin\nwires of copper and silver that supply electricity to the spin\nmotor of each gyroscope.\n\n\n   ``Right now, the telescope is working just fine and we see no\nday-to-day impact in our normal science operations from any of\nthese issues with the gyroscopes,'' said David Leckrone, the\nHubble's senior project scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight\nCenter in Greenbelt, Md.\n\n\n   But with the loss of a fourth gyroscope, ground control teams\nwould be forced to begin to curtail observations. When it finally\nfails, the telescope will slip into an electronic slumber called\n``safe mode.''\n\n\n   All of the gyroscopes are at least 11-years-old and the oldest\nis 14-years-old. Two of the three fully functioning gyroscopes are\namong those originally installed on the telescope.\n\n\n   NASA believes the mission will take nine days.\n\n\n   The seven months it has to prepare for the flight will be the\nshortest for any it has attempted, and there is a possibility NASA\ncould advance the launch into late September. The commander, pilot\nand robot arm operator will be named later this week, joining the\nspacewalking team of Mike Foale, John Grunsfeldand Steve Smith of\nthe United States, and Claude Nicollier of Switzerland.\n\n\n   ``This flight will be a challenge, I can tell you that,'' said\nNASA's Linda Ham, who will serve as the lead flight director for\nthe mission.\n\n\n   Following a rendezvous at 360 miles above the Earth, the 50-foot\nshuttle arm will be used to grab Hubble and carefully mount it on a\nwork platform in Discovery's cargo bay.\n\n\n   In addition to the gyroscopes, the spacewalkers will install a\nnew flight computer on the telescope as well as a data recorder and\ntransmitter. They also are prepared to replace reflective\ninsulation on the exterior of the Hubble, which is deteriorating\nfrom its long exposure to corrosive elements in the Earth's upper\natmosphere and to radiation.\n\n\n   The exterior damage was a surprise when first detected by\nshuttle astronauts who last visited the space telescope in February\n1997.

Smith and John M. Grunsfeld, started\nthe first of three planned spacewalks at 1:54 p.m., about an hour\nearlier than scheduled to tackle the most important and difficult\npart of the repair mission.\n\n\n   Stepping out of an airlock as the shuttle Discovery passed over\nAustralia, Smith, a veteran spacewalker who has flown on two\nprevious shuttle missions, said to his colleague, ``You ready to\ngo?'' and added, ``Hubble needs us.''\n\n\n   Grunsfeld, a physicist on his third shuttle flight but a novice\nspacewalker, said ``Beautiful sight out here'' as he stepped into\nDiscovery's cargo bay. ``Hello Hubble,'' he said looking up at the\n43-foot observatory towering above him, ``That's one beautiful\ntelescope.''\n\n\n   Hubble has been out of commission since Nov. 13, when a fourth\ngyroscope failed, rendering the telescope incapable of holding\nsteady enough to conduct scientific observations. The observatory\npowered down and went into a protective ``safe mode'' awaiting its\norbital repair crew.\n\n\n   Working from lockers in the payload bay that contain scores of\ntools and replacement parts, the astronauts repeatedly carried new\nequipment up to the 25,000-pound telescope secured to a cradle\nabove and brought down old parts that will be returned to Earth for\nexamination.\n\n\n   After the gyroscope exchange, which took about an hour longer\nthan expected, the spacewalk team moved to open valves on a cooling\nunit attached to a disabled infrared camera to purge nitrogen\ncoolant. This was to prepare the camera unit, inoperative because\nof an earlier coolant leak, for a replacement cooling device to be\ninstalled on a service mission set for 2001. The astronauts\ninitially could not remove caps covering the valves, but later\nforced them off and completed the task.\n\n\n   Next, Smith and Grunsfeld installed voltage regulator kits on\nHubble's six aging batteries. The six Voltage-Temperature\nImprovement Kits were designed to improve the batteries' efficiency\nwhile keeping them from overcharging and overheating during periods\nof low power use.\n\n\n   On Thursday, a team made up of the NASA astronaut C. Michael\nFoale and Claude Nicollier of the European Space Agency is to\nconduct the second spacewalk starting in the early afternoon.\n\n\n   The astronauts are to replace Hubble's central computer with a\nnew, faster model and exchange one of the telescope's three Fine\nGuidance Sensors with a refurbished unit. These sensors let the\ntelescope locked onto a target for hours or days at a time.",

And a third gyroscope is partly broken and is considered \nunreliable. \n\n\n\tAstronomers need at least three perfect gyroscopes to conduct  \nobservations throughout the universe. \n\n\n\t``We are one failure away from losing science,'' said Ed Weiler,  \nhead of NASA's space science program. \n\n\n\tAlthough the $2 billion telescope would be safe in orbit without  \nany working gyroscopes, NASA does not want to risk losing any \nvaluable science time. \n\n\n\t``This is not a so-called spacecraft emergency where we're in  \ndanger of losing the entire mission or the entire spacecraft,'' \nWeiler said. ``You can think of it more as a science emergency.'' \n\n\n\tUnder the plan, the original 2000 mission will be divided into  \ntwo parts: the first will be launched around mid-October aboard \nDiscovery and the second in late 2000 or early 2001. \n\n\n\tBesides replacing all six gyroscopes in October, spacewalking  \nastronauts will install a new computer, radio transmitter, guidance \nsensor and data recorder, and fix peeling insulation. \n\n\n\tDuring their second visit, the same astronauts will equip Hubble  \nwith new solar panels, an advanced camera and a newfangled cooling \nunit for an infrared camera that has run out of the frozen nitrogen \nneeded for observations. \n\n\n\tThe four astronauts who will do the repairs have been training  \nsince last summer and can easily accommodate the early flight, NASA \nsaid. \n\n\n\tThe extra mission will cost NASA $75 million more than what's  \nbeen budgeted for Hubble. But Weiler called it ``a rather good \ninsurance policy'' considering the science that might be lost if \nNASA were to wait until next summer to make the repairs. \n\n\n\tHubble was launched in 1990 with a misshapen mirror.  \nSpacewalking astronauts corrected the telescope's vision in 1993, \nrestoring Hubble to a world-class instrument able to see to the \nfringes of the universe, and returned in 1997 to add or replace 11 \nmajor parts. \n\n\n\tNASA will have to rearrange the shuttle flight schedule to  \nsqueeze in the Hubble mission. Those details have yet to be worked \nout.",

      "content": "NASA SHUTTLE MISSION IS MOVED UP TO REPAIR HUBBLE TELESCOPE\n\n\n\n   WASHINGTON _ Seeking to avoid a ``science emergency'' with the\nHubble Space Telescope, NASA officials announced Wednesday that\nthey would launch a space shuttle to repair failing parts on the\norbiting observatory in mid-October, eight months ahead of\nschedule.\n\n\n   National Aeronautics and Space Administration officials said the\nshuttle Discovery and a team of spacewalking astronauts would be\ndispatched to replace malfunctioning gyroscopes that stabilize\nHubble and allow the 12.5-ton telescope to point accurately at\ntargets across the universe.\n\n\n   Edward J. Weiler, NASA's associate administrator for science,\nsaid at a news conference that the $2 billion telescope itself was\nnot in danger, but its scientific mission was threatened by the\nmalfunctioning pointing devices.\n\n\n   ``This is not a spacecraft emergency,'' Weiler said, ``it's more\nof a science emergency.''\n\n\n   Hubble, which has regularly uncovered the mysteries of the\ncosmos since its launching in 1990, ``is the crown jewel of NASA's\nspace observatories,'' said Weiler, and every reasonable effort\nmust be made to keep it functioning. While the telescope is now\noperating normally, he said, only three of its six gyroscopes are\nworking properly, the minimum needed for it to perform its\nobservations.\n\n\n   Two gyroscopes have failed and a third is acting so abnormally\nthat it cannot be relied upon as a backup. If one of the three\nfunctioning gyroscopes fails in coming months, Weiler said, Hubble\nwill have to cease its science mission and go into a protective\n``safe mode'' until replacement parts are installed.\n\n\n   ``We are one failure away from losing all science from the\nHubble Space Telescope,'' Weiler said.\n\n\n   Officials said the risk of losing months of invaluable Hubble\ndata, wasting about $20 million per month budgeted for these\nobservations, made it worth spending extra money for an early\nservice mission. The October shuttle mission will add an extra $25\nmillion to Hubble program costs over two years and $50 million to\nshuttle program costs over the same period, officials said.\n\n\n   Under the new plan, the Hubble service mission scheduled for\nJune 2000 will be split into two parts, with about half of the\nplanned modifications and equipment changes being carried out in\nOctober during a nine-day flight. In addition to replacing all six\nof Hubble's gyroscopes, astronauts are to exchange the\nobservatory's central computer with a faster, new model; add a new\nfine-guidance sensor; replace an old-style data tape recorder with\na digital model, and change a backup radio transmitter.\n\n\n   A second mission to upgrade Hubble's scientific equipment,\nduring which a powerful new camera will be added to look at small\nobjects and the solar power arrays will be replaced, will be flown\nbetween December 2000, and March 2001.\n\n\n   William Readdy, an astronaut who is the shuttle program\ndirector, said the same four astronauts who were training to do\nspacewalks for the original service assignment would fly on both\nsegments of the divided mission. They are Steven L. Smith, C.\nMichael Foale, John M. Grunsfeld and Claude Nicollier. The\nremaining crew members, a commander, a pilot and a flight engineer,\nwill be announced by the end of the week, Readdy said.\n\n\n   It normally takes more than a year to plan a shuttle mission,\nReaddy said, but the flight to Hubble can be put together quickly\nbecause most of the crew is far along in training for it.",

Hubble has been out of operation for more\nthan six weeks, since four of six stabilizing gyroscopes failed,\nmaking it impossible for the telescope to lock onto celestial\ntargets for scientific studies.\n\n\n   If the much-delayed repair mission, originally scheduled for\nOctober, is successful, scientists hope to have Hubble back in\noperation sometime next month.\n\n\n   Capturing the telescope begins an intensive three days of work\nfor the seven-man shuttle crew, focusing on three work-packed\nspacewalks. The shuttle's weather-delayed launching forced the\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration to drop plans for a\nfourth spacewalk and compress the original 10-day mission into\neight. NASA wants the shuttle on the ground and all mission\nequipment powered down by the end of the year to avoid any computer\nproblems associated with the year 2000 date change.\n\n\n   During the first spacewalk, scheduled to begin on Wednesday\nafternoon and last six and a half hours, the astronauts Steven L.\nSmith and John M. Grunsfeld are to perform the primary repairs of\nthe mission. The astronauts, one perched at the end of the\nshuttle's robot arm, will open the telescope and replace three Rate\nSensor Units, enclosures that each contain two of the critical\ngyroscopes needed to point and steady the telescope.\n\n\n   Working within the close quarters of the telescope, the\nastronauts must be careful not to bump or jostle Hubble's delicate\noptics and other instruments while making the equipment switches.\n\n\n   Also, insulating material inside and outside the telescope is\naging and becoming brittle, posing the risk of debris that could\nget into the observatory and damage instruments.\n\n\n   ``We certainly don't want to rub up against it because it would\ncreate little particles,'' Smith said before the flight.\n\n\n   After replacing the six gyroscopes, the astronauts are to\ninstall voltage regulator kits on Hubble's six aging batteries to\nkeep them from overcharging and overheating in periods of low power\nuse. They will also service a valve on an instrument cooling\nsystem.\n\n\n   On Thursday, C. Michael Foale, a NASA astronaut, and Claude\nNicollier, a European Space Agency astronaut, are to take more than\nsix hours for several tasks, including the replacement of Hubble's\ncentral computer with a new model, which is more than 20 times\nfaster and has six times the memory of the current one. The\nspacewalkers then will swap one of the telescope's three Fine\nGuidance Sensors with a refurbished unit. These devices allow the\ntelescope to remain locked on a target for hours or days at a time.\n\n\n   Linda Ham, the lead flight director for the mission, said NASA\ncould call the mission completely successful if the astronauts\ncompleted the tasks planned for the first two spacewalks.\n``Anything after that is added value,'' Ms. Ham said.\n\n\n   On the third spacewalk, set for Friday, Smith and Grunsfeld are\nto replace a failed radio transmitter and install",

Their objective is\nto replace a half-dozen gyroscopes, key components in the\ntelescope's pointing system, and to make other repairs.\n\n\n   The 43-foot-long telescope is the only unmanned spacecraft NASA\nhas developed that was designed for periodic visits by astronauts,\nto upgrade large cameras and other scientific instruments and to\nreplace worn-out parts.\n\n\n   A gyroscope failure, the fourth since the last repair mission,\nforced astronomers to halt observations with the telescope Nov. 13,\nlending new urgency to the much-delayed shuttle flight.\n\n\n   ``These gyros in Hubble are the most accurate ever produced,''\nsaid Ed Weiler, NASA's associate administrator for space science.\n``They are required to get the kind of science we get from Hubble.\nWithout those gyros, those stars would be just fuzzy points of\nlight.''\n\n\n   Liftoff is scheduled for 9:18 p.m. EST Thursday from Cape\nCanaveral, Fla. If Discovery takes off, the seven astronauts plan\nto gently grab the 13-ton telescope with Discovery's 50-foot robot\narm and berth it upright in the shuttle's cargo bay for the repair\nsessions.\n\n\n   During four lengthy spacewalks, alternating teams of astronauts\nwill install new gyros and a faster flight computer, and replace\nboth an out-of-date recorder used to store images and a broken\ntransmitter used to relay those images to EarthAs time permits, the spacewalkers will patch parts of Hubble's\nexternal covering damaged by solar radiation.\n\n\n   ``The Hubble is the best example ever of the successful marriage\nof the human space program and space science,'' said Weiler.\n\n\n   During their first postlaunch repair mission in 1993, shuttle\nastronauts corrected an embarrassing optical flaw that escaped\nNASA's detection before the telescope was launched. They visited\nagain in early 1997 to upgrade its observing powers with new\ncameras and other equipment.\n\n\n   Recently, NASA's repair strategy enabled it to extend the\nobservatory's operational life to 2010, five years beyond the\noriginal plan and long enough to permit the development of an even\nmore capable successor.\n\n\n   The extension will push NASA's total Hubble investment to nearly\n$6 billion. The space agency estimates the cost of Discovery's\n10-day flight at $205 million, including expenses for the telescope\nrepairs. However, the cost is nearly $400 million if a 1998 NASA\nconsultant's estimate for the cost of a shuttle flight is applied.\n\n\n   With nearly 13,000 observations to date, the space telescope has\nmade remarkable discoveries. It has enabled astronomers to refine\ntheir estimates of the age of the universe at 12 billion years and\nto calculate with more certainty that the cosmos will expand\nforever.\n\n\n   Recent images reveal dust discs swirling around a collection of\ntwo dozen young stars, a prelude to the formation of planets,\nastronomers believe. Working with other space- and ground-based\nobservatories, the Hubble has gathered much-sought evidence that\npuzzling periodic gamma ray bursts occur in the fringes of the\nuniverse, rather than within the Milky Way galaxy.\n\n\n   NASA announced the shuttle's latest service call in March to\nstem the succession of gyro failures. At the time, only three of\nthe devices were still functioning, the minimal number needed for\ncosmic observations.\n\n\n   Spinning at 19,200 revolutions per minute, the gyros hold the\nlarge telescope steady so that it can stare at faint stellar\ntargets for lengthy periods of time.\n\n\n   Despite its astronaut-friendly design, the telescope is\nconsidered a fragile instrument that must be handled with care to\nprevent its precision optics from becoming contaminated or\nmisaligned.\n\n\n   ``You watch with your heart in your mouth basically,'' said\nNASA's Anne Ki",

The\ntelescope needs a minimum of three of its six gyroscopes operating\nto make astronomical observations, and had been limping along on\nthree of the devices since February.\n\n\n   Troubled by the threat of losing valuable observations from one\nof the world's premier optical telescopes, National Aeronautics and\nSpace Administration officials decided last March to divide a\nHubble service mission planned for June 2000 and send up a\nspace-shuttle crew early to install new gyroscopes and do some\nother work.\n\n\n   The 10-day service flight, originally scheduled for mid-October\nbut delayed because of space-shuttle problems, is tentatively set\nfor launching on Dec. 6. A second mission, to complete Hubble\nmodifications planned for the original service and repair flight,\nis scheduled for May 2001.\n\n\n   Dr. David Leckrone of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in\nGreenbelt, Md., the senior project scientist for Hubble, said\nMonday that the observatory's shutdown shows the wisdom of last\nspring's decision to fly a service mission early. If the shuttle\nmission gets off on time and is successful, he said, the loss of\nHubble data will be minimal.\n\n\n   ``I'm feeling very lucky today,'' Leckrone said in an interview.\n``It could have been much worse, and it's gratifying to know that\nwe made the right call.''\n\n\n   In announcing the early mission, Dr. Edward Weiler, NASA's chief\nscientist, said the agency wanted to avoid a ``science emergency''\nin which researchers would lose the service of one of astronomy's\ncrown jewels. About $20 million a month is budgeted for Hubble\nobservations, he said, and the $75 million cost of the extra\nshuttle service mission was worth the expense to protect this\nresearch investment.\n\n\n   With only two working gyroscopes, the Hubble automatically went\ninto ``safe mode,'' a dormant condition in which the telescope\nclosed its aperture door to protect its optics and aligned itself\nto the sun to ensure that its solar panels could draw adequate\npower. Ground crews continue to control and monitor the craft when\nit is in the safe state, officials said.\n\n\n   NASA officials said Hubble's shutdown should result in only\nthree weeks of lost data. Leckrone said about 100 observations had\nbeen scheduled between last weekend and the beginning of the\nservice mission, at which time the telescope was to have stopped\ndoing studies for three weeks to a month anyway.\n\n\n   It should be possible to reschedule most of the lost\nobservations within the next year, Leckrone said.\n\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n\n   The shuttle Discovery was moved to its launching pad over the\nweekend and its seven-member crew is at the Kennedy Space Center in\nFlorida to rehearse the countdown and launching. Discovery's flight\nwas delayed because testing and modifications to all electrical\nwiring in all four shuttles took longer than expected, and one of\nDiscovery's three main engines had to be changed after a servicing\naccident.\n\n\n   The primary task of the mission is to replace all six of\nHubble's gyroscopes, which are packaged in pairs. Four new\ngyroscopes were installed during the first Hubble servicing\nmission, in 1993, and all six of the instruments were working\nduring the second service mission, in 1997. One failed later in\n1997, a second stopped working in 1998 and a third was lost last\nFebruary.\n\n\n   The gyroscope problems appear to be caused by corrosion in\nsilver-copper wires the size of a human hair that carry electricity\nto the high-speed motors that turn the gyroscopes' stabilizing\nwheels.

Crucial\nto the precise pointing of the telescope, the new gyros will enable\nastronomers to resume the celestial observations halted in\nmid-November because of successive failures.\n\n\n   Voltage regulators installed during the first spacewalk to\nprolong the life of the telescope's six aging power storage\nbatteries passed a thorough checkout as well.\n\n\n   Astronauts Mike Foale and Claude Nicollier teamed for Thursday's\neight-hour excursion.\n\n\n   ``Wonderful. Beautiful,'' exclaimed Nicollier, as Discovery\nsailed more than 360 miles above the Pacific Ocean. ``It's a great\nprivilege to work on Hubble for the astronomical community all over\nthe world.``\n\n\n   Soon, Foale and Nicollier were perched on the tip of the\nshuttle's 55-foot-long robot arm, rising to an equipment bay that\nhouses the Hubble's main computer at the midsection of the\n42-foot-long space telescope.\n\n\n   The observatory has towered from a berthing mechanism in the\nshuttle's cargo bay since the Discovery astronauts rendezvoused\nwith the telescope Tuesday night.\n\n\n   Within two-and-a-half hours, Foale and Nicollier had removed the\ntelescope's original, late 1970s-era computer and replaced it with\na newer model.\n\n\n   The new $7 million computer has 20 times the processing speed of\nthe older model and six times its memory.\n\n\n   Next, Foale assisted Nicollier with another time consuming\nrepair task.\n\n\n   Again riding the tip of the shuttle arm, the two spacewalkers\nascended midway up the side of the telescope to replace one of the\nobservatory's three fine guidance sensors. Like the gyros, the\nsensors are crucial to aiming the telescope at celestial targets\nand holding it steady.\n\n\n   Replacing the large sensor proved difficult. A $13 million\nreplacement wedged out of position as the two spacewalkers tried to\nslide it into place. Nicollier and Foale wiggled it free, removed\nit and reinserted the sensor without difficulty.\n\n\n   At one point, concerned ground controllers noted a high carbon\ndioxide reading from medical sensors within Nicollier's space suit.\n\n\n   ``I'm working hard, but I feel fine,'' Nicollier assured mission\ncontrol, where experts determined the high readings were probably\ncoming from an errant sensor. ``I'm just thirsty, but I'm OK.''\n\n\n   Though Thursday's successful spacewalk completed all of the\nmajor Hubble repair tasks assigned to Discovery's crew, astronauts\nSteve Smith and John Grunsfeld will return to the telescope again\nFriday during a third and final excursion.\n\n\n   As an encore to Wednesday's gyro repair, Smith and Grunsfeld\nwill install a faster data recorder and a new transmitter. Both are\nused to store the celestial imagery gathered by the telescope and\nrelay it to ground-based astronomers.\n\n\n   The space telescope was launched in 1990. Discovery's is the\nthird shuttle visit to the telescope, which was developed so that\nit could be repaired and equipped with new instruments by\nspacewalking astronauts.\n\n\n   After nearly a decade in orbit, Hubble remains one of the\nworld's most powerful observatories.\n\n\n   Astronomers have used it to refine the age of the universe at\nabout 12 billion years and to bolster",

The fast revving\nturbines in the small gyroscopes are a crucial component of a\npointing mechanism that enables the 12.5-ton instrument to be aimed\nat celestial targets selected by ground-based astronomers with\nunprecedented precision.\n\n\n   ``It's a beautiful sight out here, beautiful day,'' said Smith\nas he emerged from Discovery's airlock shortly before 1 p.m. CST to\nkick off the first excursion.\n\n\n   The shuttle sped more than 360 miles over the Pacific Ocean west\nof Australia as Smith surveyed his new surroundings.\n\n\n   ``Hello, Hubble,'' gasped Grunsfeld, who traded a career as an\nastronomer to become an astronaut. ``That's a big telescope.''\n\n\n   The two men purposefully began what was to be a six-hour\nspacewalk nearly an hour early. They were hopeful the head start\nwould enable them to recover some of the repair tasks dropped from\nthe flight as Discovery lifted off Sunday after a record nine\nlaunch delays. In order to complete the flight before New Year's\nEve and a potential Y2K conflict, mission managers trimmed the\nflight from 10 to eight days and cut the number of spacewalks from\nfour to three.\n\n\n   The strategy proved wise as the nearly three hours alloted for\nthe gyro replacement took almost four hours. At times, the men\nstruggled with the demanding, hand-intensive work.\n\n\n   The cupboardlike doors of a large enclosure at the base of the\ntelescope housing the gyros proved difficult for the astronauts to\nopen, slowing their efforts. Then some of the bolts securing the\nthree toaster-sized assemblies holding the six gyros resisted the\nfirst efforts by the spacewalkers to remove them.\n\n\n   ``Got some curve balls, got some knuckle balls today,'' Smith\nmuttered at one point.\n\n\n   Working as a team, Smith leaned into the telescope enclosure on\nhis back, while Grunsfeld held his weightless colleague in place at\nthe feet. Using battery-powered ratchets, they removed one gyro\nassembly and replaced it with a new one before moving to the next.\n\n\n   Engineers believe the older gyros failed as hair-thin electrical\nwires corroded and broke. Five of the six new gyros were modified\nto prevent a recurrence. The space agency says it ran out of time\nto produce the sixth.\n\n\n   Smith and Grunsfeld also struggled with a second task, freeing a\npair of small valves to release nitrogen gas from a failed cooling\nsystem for the telescope's infrared camera. Engineers want nitrogen\nfrozen in the cooling lines to vent away before a replacement\nrefrigerator is installed during a shuttle visit in mid-2001.\n\n\n   Alloted 15 minutes, the task took more than 90 minutes.\n\n\n   Smith and Grunsfeld regained their stride with the ins",

      "content": "DISCOVERY CREW ON ITS WAY TO REPAIR HUBBLE \n\n\n\n\n   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ The shuttle Discovery rocketed into space\nlate Sunday with seven astronauts on a much-delayed mission to\nrepair the high-flying Hubble Space Telescope.\n\n\n   Discovery thundered from its coastal launch pad at NASA's\nKennedy Space Center at 7:50 p.m. EST. The shuttle climbed steeply\ninto a darkened sky on an easterly trajectory.\n\n\n   Minutes later, Discovery settled into a 364-mile-high orbit,\ncompleting the first leg of its Christmas mission to replace\nfaltering gyroscopes aboard the $4 billion telescope. The\nobservatory sailed over Africa as Discovery lifted off.\n\n\n   Originally targeted for a mid-October liftoff, Discovery's\nlaunch had been rescheduled a record nine times by equipment\nproblems and bad weather. NASA considered Sunday night the final\nopportunity to lift off this year.\n\n\n   ``Send a note to the Hubble to get ready because we are on our\nway,'' Discovery commander Curt Brown radioed ground controllers as\nthe final minutes of Sunday's trouble-free countdown ticked away.\n\n\n   Hours before the launch, managers agreed to trim the mission\nfrom its original 10 days to eight and the number of spacewalks\nfrom four to three in order to satisfy NASA's Y2K computer\nconstraints. Discovery is scheduled to land Dec. 27. But if there\nare landing delays because of poor weather, the space agency wants\nthe shuttle crew back on Earth no later than Dec. 29.\n\n\n   The schedule enables NASA to re-set mission and launch control\ncomputers before New Year's Eve. Though it has prepared Discovery\nand its ground facilities to be Y2K compliant, NASA established the\nDec. 29 deadline as a precaution.\n\n\n   Brown's crew includes pilot Scott Kelly and Jean Francois\nClervoy of the European Space Agency, the flight engineer and robot\narm operator. Accompanying the flight crew is a four-man spacewalk\nrepair team, Steve Smith, Mike Foale, John Grunsfeld and European\nSpace Agency astronaut Claude Nicollier.\n\n\n   With a series of carefully timed orbital maneuvers, Discovery\nshould overtake the space telescope Tuesday. Using Discovery's\n50-foot-long robot arm, Clervoy will snare the 12.5-ton Hubble\nshortly before 8 p.m. EST as the spacecraft fly in close formation.\n\n\n   Once in the shuttle's grasp, the 42-foot-long space telescope\nwill be latched upright onto a rotating work platform in the aft\nsection of Discovery's open cargo bay.\n\n\n   Smith and Grunsfeld plan to kick off the first of the mission's\nlengthy spacewalks Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\n   During the first excursion, the men plan to replace all six of\nthe Hubble's gyroscopes, the $400 million mission's highest\npriority.\n\n\n   Celestial observations with the space telescope ceased Nov. 13,\nwhen a fourth gyro malfunctioned. Without at least three of the\nhigh-revving devices, the telescope cannot lock on to stellar\nobjects with precision as it races around the Earth once every 97\nminutes.\n\n\n   With a successful gyro installation, NASA would consider\nDiscovery's flight at least a minimal success if the other\nspacewalks had to be canceled. With the installation of the new\ngyros, the space telescope could resume stellar observations in\nJanuary, said NASA's Dave Leckrone, the Hubble's senior project\nscientist.\n\n\n   Nevertheless, once the gyro task is complete, Smith and\nGrunsfeld plan to install voltage meters on each of the\nobservatory's six batteries. The cell phone-sized devices are\nintended to prolong the life of the 9-year-old batteries by keeping\nthem from overheating as they age. The batteries are continually\ndischarged by the telescope's instruments and re-charged by its\npower-generating solar arrays.\n\n\n   During the second spacewalk Thursday, Foale and Nicollier will\nteam to replace the telescope's flight computer. The newer computer\nhas six times the memory and is capable of processing data 20 times\nfaster than its predecessor.\n\n\n   The two astronauts are also prepared to replace one of the\ntelescope's three fine guidance sensors, an optical instrument\nabout the size of a baby grand piano.

Observations were halted Nov. 13 when a fourth of the\nsix gyros failed.\n\n\n   The major tasks include:\n\n\n   _ The six gyroscopes, paired in three toaster-size electronics\nboxes. Only two are working as Discovery prepares to lift off. At\nleast three are necessary for astronomical observations. NASA would\naccept Discovery's mission as a minimal success if the astronauts\ndepart Hubble with five gyroscopes operating.\n\n\n   Engineers believe hair-thin internal copper and silver\nelectrical wires have crumbled from corrosion. Five of the six new\ngyros have been assembled with a new technique to eliminate the\ncorrosion problem. There wasn't time to complete a sixth, NASA\nsays.\n\n\n   _ Six voltage improvement kits. These cell phone-size\nelectronics boxes are designed to keep the half-dozen storage\nbatteries on Hubble from overheating as they are recharged with\nsolar power. Nearly 10 years old, the batteries have become more\nsensitive to heat as they re-charge.\n\n\n   _ Flight control computer. Hubble's current computer is based on\n1970s technology, though it was augmented with an Intel 386\nco-processor in 1993. The portable TV-size replacement incorporates\nIntel 486 processors that will increase the processing power by 40\ntimes and enlarge the memory 30-fold. It takes four years to modify\na computer to withstand the higher radiation levels of space,\nruling out a Pentium-class computer on this mission.\n\n\n   _ Fine guidance sensor. Along with the gyroscopes, the three\nfine guidance sensors are a crucial part of the Hubble's pointing\nsystem. One of the baby grand piano-size devices will be replaced.\nIt works with the flight computer to locate preselected guide stars\nthat lock the telescope onto its targets. The newest fine guidance\nsensor was actually removed in 1997 and refurbished for\nre-installation on this mission.\n\n\n   With the gyroscopes, voltage improvement kits, computer and fine\nguidance sensor installed, NASA would call the flight a full\nsuccess. However, other tasks are planned.\n\n\n   _ S-band transmitter, an electronic device that relays digital\nimagery data gathered by the telescope to a NASA communications\nsatellite, which then transmits the information to a NASA ground\nstation. One of the two original transmitters on the telescope\nfailed in 1998, though each was expected to last 15 years.\n\n\n   _ Solid state recorder. The telescope was launched with three\nreel-to-reel style data recorders, one of which was replaced by a\nsolid state device with computer chip data storage during the 1997\nrepair mission. A second shoe box-size solid state device with a\n10-fold improvement in memory capacity will be installed.\n\n\n   _ External insulation. The metallic outer insulation on Hubble\nshowed unexpected signs of wear from the corrosive effects of solar\nradiation and reactive oxygen molecules in Earth's upper atmosphere\nwhen astronauts visited in 1997.\n\n\n   The squad of spacewalkers plans to install six new stainless\nsteel panels over the equipment bays on the telescope. These 3-by-5\npanels will help keep internal equipment at room temperature in\nspite of external conditions that range from 180 degrees Fahrenheit\nin sunlight to minus 130 degrees in darkness.\n\n\n   _ Release nitrogen gas from the cooling system of the\ntelescope's infrared camera. Installed by astronauts in 1997, the\nfrozen nitrogen refrigerant exhausted prematurely in January.\nResidues of the gas can be released by an astronaut turning a value\nso that a new refrigerant system can be installed on a future\nvisit.\n\n\n   _ More external insulation repair. As time permits, the\nspacewalkers plan to affix up to seven rolls of flexible metallic\ncovering to the telescope's light barrel. The longest\nwallpap",

But if all goes according to plan, the Hubble Space\nTelescope, a window through which humans have viewed the edges of\nspace for almost a decade, will soon be reawakened by the nudging,\ngloved hands of astronauts replacing and repairing the failed inner\nworks that forced it into hibernation.\n\n\n   This weekend, as NASA still struggles to understand the silence\nfrom Mars where the Mars Polar Lander was scheduled to touch down\non Friday, the space shuttle Discovery is scheduled to blast off on\na mission to restore the observatory.\n\n\n   The telescope has been shut down since Nov. 13, when its\nprecision pointing system failed and the observatory went dormant.\n\n\n   During the mission, scheduled to last almost 10 days, Discovery\nis to dock with Hubble 300 miles above Earth. Astronauts then\nexpect to move the telescope into the cargo bay where repairs are\nto be made during four six-and-a-half-hour spacewalks.\n\n\n   The objective is to replace all six gyroscopes, rapidly spinning\ndevices that use their momentum to stabilize the spacecraft and\nhelp it aim at distant targets. Since February, Hubble had been\ngetting by on just three gyroscopes, which is the minimum, until\nthis month, when another failed.\n\n\n   With only two working gyroscopes, the telescope went into a\n``safe mode'' to await repairs. It closed its aperture door to\nprotect its optics and instruments and aligned its solar panels to\nthe Sun to assure adequate power.\n\n\n   The Hubble, which cost $2 billion, was launched in 1990 and,\ndespite problems with a defective main mirror, has become one of\nthe most important telescopes in history.\n\n\n   Looking into space from above the obscuring effects of the\nEarth's atmosphere, the 12.5-ton observatory has given astronomers\nan unprecedented look at colliding galaxies, star formation and the\nremnants of events that occurred early in the history of the\nuniverse.\n\n\n   NASA has spent $1 billion maintaining and operating Hubble since\nit was launched, including developing corrective optics for its\nflawed mirror, making second-generation instruments to replace\nolder ones and sending space shuttles to maintain and repair the\nobservatory in 1993 and 1997.\n\n\n   A third service mission had been scheduled for June 2000, but\nNASA decided in March that it would move up some of the maintenance\nbecause of the deteriorating gyroscopes.\n\n\n   Dr. Edward Weiler, associate administrator for space science at\nNASA, said the agency decided to schedule an earlier mission to\nminimize the loss of observation time with Hubble, which has a\nbacklog of assignments.\n\n\n   If repairs by the Discovery crew succeed, officials said, Hubble\nwill lose about a month of observation time compared with at least\nseven months if the agency had stayed with the original schedule.\n\n\n   To complete all of the maintenance that had been planned for the\nflight in June, NASA has scheduled a mission for May 2001, which\nwill include major upgrades of Hubble's instruments.\n\n\n   Discovery's flight was originally scheduled for mid-October, but\nthe mission had been delayed because of assorted problems. A series\nof electrical wiring problems required extensive inspection and\nrepairs, and shuttle managers decided to replace one of Discovery's\nthree main engines because of an accident while the craft ws being\nmaintained.\n\n\n   Ron Dittemore, NASA's shuttle program director, said the agency\nhas set Dec. 14 as the last date to launch the mission this year.\nNASA does not want to be flying on New Year's Day because of the\nthreat of any possible computer problems caused by the Year 2000\ndate change. While the agency has tested its computers and\nsoftware, Dittemore said, ``It is prudent not to fly if we don't\nhave to.''\n\n\n   Crew members said delays in the launching have provided\nadditional time to train. Keith Johnson, who is in charge of\nspacewalk training at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, said the\nastronauts were able to complete 10 hours of training in an\nunderwater tank",

      "content": "FAILED GYROSCOPE PUTS HUBBLE INTO SLUMBER; REPAIR MISSION NEXT\nMONTH \n \n\n\n\n\n   HOUSTON _ The fourth of six gyroscopes aboard the orbiting\nHubble Space Telescope has faltered, forcing an abrupt halt to all\ncelestial observations and lending new urgency to a December space\nshuttle repair mission, NASA said Monday.\n\n\n   Spacewalking astronauts have trained to replace all six of the\ngyroscopes and make other repairs during the 10-day flight of the\nshuttle Discovery. The shuttle is to lift off with a crew of seven,\nincluding a quartet of spacewalkers, on Dec. 6.\n\n\n   Saturday's failure left the 13-ton, 43-foot long telescope with\nonly two operable gyroscopes. At least three are required to carry\nout observations of stars, galaxies and other celestial phenomena.\n\n\n   The high-revving gyroscopes are among the most crucial\ncomponents of the telescope's pointing system, which enables\nground-based astronomers to aim and lock the space telescope onto\ndistant, faint objects for lengthy observations.\n\n\n   Anticipating additional gyroscope losses, NASA in March\nannounced an unscheduled servicing call by shuttle astronauts,\nweeks after a third Hubble gyroscope faltered. The gyroscopes were\ndesigned for periodic replacement. NASA places the gyroscope\nreplacement portion of the upcoming $205 million mission at $8\nmillion.\n\n\n   The next scheduled shuttle visit to Hubble had been planned for\nmid-2000. Initially, the agency planned to move the flight to\nmid-October, but that changed with the July launching of the\nshuttle Columbia with the Chandra X-ray Observatory.\n\n\n   Moments after liftoff, Columbia experienced an electrical short\nthat was traced to insulation damage on internal wiring. The\nfinding forced a suspension of all shuttle flights until Discovery,\nEndeavour, Atlantis and Columbia could be inspected and repaired.\n\n\n   Discovery was towed to its launch pad at NASA's Kennedy Space\nCenter in Florida on Saturday.\n\n\n   Meanwhile, the latest gyroscope failure forced the space\ntelescope into an electronic slumber called a ``safe mode.'' The\noperating mode ensures that the telescope continues to generate\nelectricity for its scientific equipment and flight controls,\nthough it is unable to point at celestial targets.\n\n\n   The gyroscope stopped after experiencing a sudden power surge.\nThe previous failures followed successive electrical\nirregularities, some spanning several weeks.\n\n\n   ``This underscores the wisdom of scheduling this call-up service\nmission,'' said David Leckrone, the Hubble's senior project\nscientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.,\nwhere the observatory is managed. ``We will only lose about three\nweeks of science observations. Had we not split the mission and\nproceeded with our June 2000 mission we would be facing a\nseven-month interruption.''\n\n\n   In addition to replacing all six gyroscopes next month,\nspacewalking astronauts plan to install a faster flight computer, a\nsolid state data recorder, a new transmitter, another large\nguidance device as well as new external insulation.\n\n\n   &QL; \n &QL; \nXXXX END OF STORY &QL;",

Only 200 requests\nhave been approved.\n\n\n   Columbia is scheduled to blast off with the telescope tonight\n(Monday) &UR;  &LR; at 11:36 p.m. CDT from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in\nFlorida. Led by Eileen Collins, the first woman to command a\nshuttle crew, the five astronauts plan to deploy the new\nobservatory and its two-stage propulsion system, within eight\nhours.\n\n\n   ``This is a historic moment, an exciting moment for\nastrophysics,'' said Martin Weisskopf, Chandra's chief astronomer\non the eve of the liftoff. ``This is an age when superlatives are\nused in everything from sports to politics, probably a little bit\ntoo much. But I can't help but use these superlatives with this\ntelescope.''\n\n\n   As one of just four large major space telescopes envisioned by\nNASA for its post-Apollo years and dubbed the Great Observatories,\nChandra is all about superlatives.\n\n\n   Two decades of development at the Marshall Space Flight Center\nin Huntsville, Ala., five to 10 years of orbital operations, a\nshuttle launch and construction of a one-of-a-kind, ground-based\noptical testing facility will bring the total estimated mission\ncost to $2.8 billion.\n\n\n   ``This is a very big program,'' acknowledged Ed Weiler, NASA's\nassociate administrator for space science. ``We are putting a lot\nof eggs in one basket. If it works like we think it will, it will\nbe well worth the investment, just like the Hubble was.''\n\n\n   Earlier this year, the space agency agreed to extend the\nHubble's orbital life from 15 to 20 years, enabling it to probe the\nboundaries of the universe. But as Hubble's former chief\nastronomer, Weiler recalls well that telescope's nightmarish\nbeginning. Weeks after it reached orbit in 1990, astronomers\ndiscovered its primary mirror was misshapen, blurring its vision\nand shaking public confidence in NASA.\n\n\n   Three years later, shuttle astronauts managed to correct the\ndifficulties with a do-or-die repair mission.\n\n\n   ``The Hubble problem sent shivers through everyone in the space\nscience business,'' said Weiler. ``A lot of important lessons were\nlearned. The important thing is not only did we learn those\nlessons, but we acted on them.''\n\n\n   Chandra was headed toward an August 1998 liftoff when engineers\nat Marshall and its prime contractor, California-based TRW,\ndiscovered problems in the craft's computer software. Then the\nsupplier of critical electronic circuity disclosed problems with\nsimilar components on another satellite.

European Space Agency\nastronaut Jean Francois Clervoy was to grab the observatory with\nDiscovery's 50-foot-long robot arm shortly before 8 p.m. EST. Once\nnabbed, the towering observatory will be secured upright atop a\nrotating work platform within the shuttle's cargo bay.\n\n\n   The delicate operation more than 360 miles above the Earth will\nset the stage for a series of three long spacewalks this week by\nastronauts Steve Smith, John Grunsfeld, Mike Foale and Claude\nNicollier to repair the Hubble's crippled pointing system and make\nother repairs.\n\n\n   Discovery's pursuit of the space telescope began Sunday night as\nthe shuttle soared into orbit from its Florida launching complex,\nwhile the Hubble sailed high above Central Africa.\n\n\n   It was the first shuttle launching since the late July liftoff\nof Columbia was jeopardized by an electrical short. Later traced to\nchaffed insulation in fuselage wiring, Columbia's short prompted\nthe space agency to suspend launchings while all of the winged\nships underwent extensive inspections and wiring repairs.\n\n\n   Though the bulk of the eight-day mission lies ahead, NASA was\nclearly pleased to see Discovery in orbit after a record nine\ndelays. The postponements spanned more than two months as shuttle\nmanagers embraced a more cautious approach after the wiring\nproblems and called for additional scrutiny and repairs to a rocket\nengine as well as to external cabling and Discovery's propulsion\nand hydraulic systems.\n\n\n   ``We're back in business,'' mission control cabled Discovery\ncommander Curt Brown early Monday as the astronauts began their\nfirst full day in orbit.\n\n\n   The astronauts spent most of the day preparing Discovery's robot\narm, the airlock, the spacesuits, and more than 300 hand tools for\ntasks ahead. The tasks went smoothly, though one of the spacesuits\nhad a weak battery that was replaced.\n\n\n   Late Monday, the shuttle astronauts closed to within 1,200 miles\nof the orbital observatory, and for the first time during their\nflight maneuvered to slow rather than increase the closure rate.\n\n\n   Working closely with NASA's mission control, Brown and pilot\nScott Kelly will increase the number of maneuvers Tuesday to refine\nthe rendezvous. When Discovery reaches a point 2,500 feet below the\ntelescope, Brown will began to manually steer the shuttle close\nenough for Clervoy to grapple it.\n\n\n   Celestial observations with the telescope ceased in mid-November\nwhen the Hubble experienced its fourth gyro failure in two years.\nThe loss disabled the pointing system that permits ground-based\nastronomers to aim the telescope at distant stars and galaxies for\nlengthy observations.\n\n\n   Smith and Grunsfeld will address the gyro loss during the\nmission's first spacewalk on Wednesday by replacing all six of the\ndevices.\n\n\n   With that task complete, the spacewalkers plan to expend their\nwork by replacing the Hubble's flight computer; a data recorder and\ntransmitter that store stellar images of the celestial objects\nstudied by astronomers and relay them to Earth; and make other\nimprovements to the power and guidance systems. As time permits,\nthe spacewalkers are equipped to patch damage to the external\ninsulation of the observatory caused by solar radiation.\n\n\n   ``Obviously, we are pleased,'' NASA's Don McMonagle, Discovery's\nmission management team chairman, said of the shuttle program's\nchange in fortune. ``We have a darn near perfect vehicle in orbit\nright now.

But NASA\ndoes not intend to take any chances by having a shuttle and crew in\norbit on New Year's Day, he said.\n\n\n   ``We've decided prudently that we're not going to fly past the\nend of the year,'' Dittemore said in a telephone interview from\nJohnson Space Center in Houston. ``Since we don't have to do it, we\nwon't do it.''\n\n\n   Both the flight software for the shuttle, designed to guide it\nfrom liftoff to landing, and computer programs used by Mission\nControl to manage the voyage have been tested and certified as\nbeing Y2K compliant, Dittemore said.\n\n\n   NASA decided last spring to speed up scheduled servicing of\nHubble because some of the gyroscopes that stabilize the $2 billion\ntelescope had failed. Three of the 12.5 ton observatory's six gyros\nhave failed and the loss of one more would cause the telescope to\ngo into a hibernation mode for safekeeping, ending valuable\nscientific observations until repairs are made.\n\n\n   The agency decided to split the Hubble service mission scheduled\nfor June 2000 into two parts and make some modifications and\nrepairs, including installing new gyroscopes, in a nine-day flight\noriginally set for mid-October. The second service mission is set\nfor May 2001.\n\n\n   Last summer electrical wiring problems were found in the\nfour-shuttle fleet requiring extensive inspection and repairs,\npushing Discovery's mission into December, officials said. Shuttle\nmanagers decided this week to replace one of the shuttle's three\nmain engines, a task that they say could further delay liftoff\nseveral days past the current target date, Dec. 2.\n\n\n   Discovery is scheduled to be fitted with its external fuel tank\nand solid-fuel booster rockets this weekend and then moved to a\nlaunching pad, where technicians will replace the engine. Managers\nexpect to set a new launch date next week.\n\n\n   In order to speed preparations for the flight, shuttle managers\ndecided to use software from a 1997 service mission to Hubble\ninstead of writing new programs. This raised initial concerns about\nY2K compatibility, but Dittemore said the software had been tested\nand cleared.\n\n\n   NASA normally does not fly missions that coincide with major\nholidays to give its employees time off and to avoid overtime pay.\nHowever, Dittemore said, the Hubble mission is so important that\nthe agency decided not to make the Christmas holidays a factor in\nits decision to fly.\n\n\n   ``Our primary driver is the end of the year and not flying then,\nso we probably would not consider a launch date past Dec. 14,'' he\nsaid, ``We want to have the shuttle back and done with its initial\npost-flight processing by Dec. 28th or 29th.''\n\n\n   During this Hubble service mission, traditionally one of the\nmost challenging jobs for shuttle crews, pairs of astronauts are to\nconduct four space walks to replace all six gyroscopes, exchange\nthe observatory's main computer with a faster model, replace a data\nrecorder, add a new fine-guidance sensor and make other\nadjustments.",

Successive failures of\nthe Hubble's gyroscopes, a crucial component of the telescope's\nprecision pointing system, forced astronomers to halt celestial\nobservations a month ago.\n\n\n   The flight will mark only the third shuttle mission of the year,\nthe fewest since 1988, when a beleaguered NASA was recovering from\nthe fatal 1986 Challenger accident.\n\n\n   Space agency officials say this year's slower pace is driven by\na new sense of caution prompted by the electrical short that\njeopardized the July launching of the shuttle Columbia with the\nChandra X-Ray Observatory.\n\n\n   The incident prompted NASA to suspend future launch plans while\nit looked for the cause and to inspect its shuttles for other\nproblems.\n\n\n   ``The guys are taking a very close look at everything,'' said\nRon Dittemore, NASA's shuttle program manager. ``Maybe something we\nwould have flown with in the past and maybe not brought up as a big\ndeal _ these things are under a microscope and elevated to the\ntop.''\n\n\n   Columbia's short was traced to damaged insulation on the\nelectrical wiring buried in the shuttle's fuselage. When shuttle\nmanagers ordered inspections of Discovery as well as Endeavour and\nAtlantis, similar insulation nicks were found. Engineers concluded\nthe damage was inadvertent but caused by shuttle ground personnel\nas they repeatedly placed work platforms against the wiring as they\nprepared the winged spacecraft for past missions.\n\n\n   Eventually, 57 repairs to the fuselage wiring of Discovery were\nrequired, and NASA is revising the procedures and modifying the\nequipment its ground forces use to work on the shuttle as a result\nof Columbia's problems.\n\n\n   Meanwhile, plans announced by NASA in March for a mid-October\nshuttle visit to Hubble to fix the ailing gyros slipped seven times\nas shuttle managers dealt with the wiring problems and learned of\nother safety threats.\n\n\n   The new problems ranged from a bent fuel line and a rocket\nengine containing a broken drill bit that had to be replaced to a\nleaking hydraulic system that had to be fixed. Wiring harnesses\noutside the fuselage also required unscheduled replacements or\nrepairs. The launchings of Endeavour and Atlantis that were planned\nfor late this year have slipped into late January and mid-March.\n\n\n   As Discovery's countdown began, shuttle managers were hopeful\nthe obstacles were behind them.\n\n\n   They have prepared for consecutive launch attempts Thursday,\nFriday and Saturday, if necessary, before postponing Discovery's\nlaunching until mid-January. Typically, NASA makes two consecutive\nlaunching attempts, then allows its personnel to rest on the third\nday before resuming the countdown.\n\n\n   But the space agency wants Discovery's crew back on the ground\nno later than Dec. 28. Though it has ensured the shuttle's software\nis Y2K compliant, the space agency does not plan to risk any\ncomputer problems by flying on New Year's Eve.\n\n\n   That means several hundred personnel in the mission control\nfacility at the Johnson Space Center in Houston will work over\nChristmas, a rarity for NASA but something that will become common\nplace as it assembles the international space station.\n\n\n   According to forecasters, the prospects of favorable weather\nconditions for Thursday and Friday are 80 percent, with low clouds\nthe only concern. Conditions deteriorate slightly Saturday, when\nrain is a possibility.\n\n\n   Once in orbit, Discovery's crew plans to rendezvous with the\n42-foot-long telescope and grapple it with the shuttle's\n50-foot-long robot arm.\n\n\n   After the telescope has been secured in Discovery's cargo bay,\nastronauts Steve Smith, John Grunsfeld, Mike Foale and Claude\nNi",

(AP) -- NASA has bumped space shuttle  \nDiscovery's flight to the Hubble Space Telescope to December so \nworkers can complete wiring and valve repairs. \n\n\n\tShuttle managers said Thursday they're targeting a Dec. 2 launch  \ndate for Discovery. The telescope-repair mission had been scheduled \nfor mid-October, then mid-November. \n\n\n\tA radar-mapping mission by Endeavour, meanwhile, has been moved  \nto January. And the next flight to the international space station, \nby Atlantis, is now set for February. \n\n\n\tThe missions were delayed following Columbia's marred launch in  \nJuly. A short circuit five seconds into the flight knocked out \ncomputers for two of the three main engines; defective wiring was \nto blame.

Two  \nleaking valves in the right orbital maneuvering system must be \nreplaced. \n\n\n\tWith only two shuttle launches so far in 1999, and only one more  \nscheduled, this will be the leanest year for NASA since shuttles \nresumed flying in 1988 following the Challenger disaster.",

      "content": "SHUTTLE MISSION TO REPAIR HUBBLE TELESCOPE AGAIN DELAYED \n\n\n\n\n   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ The launch of the shuttle Discovery on a\nmuch-delayed mission to repair the Hubble Space Telescope was\npostponed for a day Thursday so engineers could widen a search for\nimproperly welded components in the shuttle's fuel lines.\n\n\n   The launch was reset for 8:47 p.m. EST Friday. Forecasters\npredict a 60 percent probability of low clouds or rain during the\n42-minute launch period.\n\n\n   NASA has said it will postpone all efforts to launch the mission\nuntil January if Discovery is not off the ground by Saturday night.\n\n\n   Thursday's postponement forced shuttle managers to trim the\nlength of the flight from 10 to nine days. NASA has prohibited its\nshuttles from flying over New Year's Eve and wants Discovery back\non the ground no later than Dec. 28 as a precaution against\nso-called Y2K computer problems. However, it believes the\nspacecraft faces no software issues.\n\n\n   The shorter mission will permit the four lengthy spacewalks that\nDiscovery's crew plans to replace the Hubble's faltering gyroscopes\nand make other repairs. The seven astronauts will give up a\nscheduled off-duty day in orbit to preserve the spacewalks.\n\n\n   ``This is disappointing,'' said Ron Dittemore, NASA's shuttle\nprogram manager, who has presided over eight setbacks since\nDiscovery was initially scheduled to liftoff in mid-October.\n\n\n   The latest issue arose late Tuesday when a California company\nthat supplies propellant lines for the shuttle's external fuel tank\nalerted NASA that an improper metal alloy had been used to weld a\nfuel line slated for use on a future mission.\n\n\n   As a precaution, shuttle engineers worked quickly to review\nX-rays of the welds on Discovery's fuel tank. They said Wednesday\nnight that Discovery's tank was OK.\n\n\n   However, on Thursday shuttle contractors asked NASA for more\ntime to expand the analysis to the welds in a dozen steel alloy\npropellant lines and other components within Discovery's tail\nsection, where the ship's three rocket engines are housed.\n\n\n   Dittemore then called a halt to the countdown so engineers could\nreassess 20-year-old records of the welding and inspection\nprocedures used in the fabrication of the 17-inch wide hydrogen and\noxygen lines and subassemblies in the engine compartment.\n\n\n   ``I don't think there is a hardware problem. What we have to do\nis search over the paperwork to convince ourselves that this is not\nan issue,'' said Dittemore. ``If this had happened two or three\ndays ago, it would be cleared up by now.''\n\n\n   Unlike the shuttle's 15-story tall fuel tank, which is disposed\nof after each launch, the components within Discovery's engine\ncompartment have already flown 26 previous missions dating back to\n1984.\n\n\n   Like its sister shuttle orbiters, Discovery was designed to fly\nat least 100 missions.\n\n\n   NASA's concern over the welds on the fuel tank were limited to\nwhether they could withstand the stresses of a single lift off.\nWith the components inside the shuttle, the concern expands to\nwhether the welds can withstand years of fatigue, Dittemore said.\n\n\n   Shuttle missions have been suspended since Columbia experienced\nan electrical short moments after its late July lift off. The short\nwas traced to damaged electrical working in Columbia's fuselage.\nThe finding prompted the space agency to inspect and repair the\nwiring on the shuttles, starting with Discovery.\n\n\n   Subsequently, other problems with Discovery contributed to the\ndelays. The space agency has replaced a rocket engine, repaired\nexternal cables and wiring, fixed a leaky hydraulic system and\nreplaced a dented fuel line.\n\n\n   Astronomical observations with Hubble were halted Nov. 13 after\nthe fourth of the telescope's six gyroscopes malfunctioned. Without\nat least three working gyros, the observatory cannot be aimed\nprecisely enough to study stars, galaxies and other distant objects\nin the universe.\n\n\n   ``It's as frustrating today as it was yesterday and the day\nbefore,'' NASA's Dave Leckrone, the Hubble's senior project\nscientists, sai",
