With the increase in international terrorism and in the wake of the TWA Flight 800 disaster, articles on airport security relating in particular to additional steps taken by airports to increase flight safety would be relevant.  The mere mention of enhanced security does not constitute relevance.  Additional steps refer to something beyond just passenger and carry-on screening using the normal methods. Examples of new steps would be additional personnel, sophisticated monitoring and screening devices, and extraordinary measures to check luggage in the baggage compartment.\n\n\nYou are a classifier for \"airport security screening enhancements\" on international flights.\n\nRELEVANT if **ANY** of these hold:\n\n- The document names a specific airport or country and describes new measures implemented (e. g. additional personnel, sophisticated monitoring and screening devices, etc.) beyond just passenger and carry-on screening using the normal methods\n- It explains how these measures differ from the usual screening procedures\n- It reports on outcomes, effectiveness, or evaluations of these measures\n\nNON-RELEVANT if any of these hold:\n\n- It only refers to standard passenger or carry-on screening methods\n- It discusses airport security in general terms or policy announcements without relating to additional steps to increase flight safety.\n- It covers the TWA Flight 800 incident background without linking to post-incident screening improvements.\n\nNEGATIVE Example:\nTitle: \"Airports Ramp Up Metal-Detector Checks After TWA 800\"\nrelevant: false\njustification: \"Mentions standard metal-detector use but no new measures beyond existing procedures.\"\n\nPOSITIVE Example:\nTitle: \"London Heathrow Deploys 3D CT Scanners for All Carry-On Bags\"\nrelevant: true\njustification: \"Airport: Heathrow; New measures: 3D CT baggage scanners replacing X-ray; Outcomes: 30 % increase in explosive detection rates with minimal delay.\"",

Rather, the trace\ndetector is as drab as its name _ a squarish, blandly colored box\nthe size of a medium-sized television set. It is so inconspicuous\nthat passengers ignore it as they stream past security checkpoints\ntoward aircraft.\n\n\n   All passenger luggage is X-rayed inside standard X-ray machines.\nBut since late last year, some luggage also has been checked for\norganic molecules wafting from any nitroglycerine or other\nexplosives that might be concealed in luggage.\n\n\n   A security officer sniff-tests luggage by taking a clean,\ncircular slip of paper and wiping it over the luggage. Then the\npaper is inserted into a hole in the explosive trace detector.\n\n\n   Usually within seconds, a light on the computer screen declares:\nNO ALARM. That means the luggage is safe.\n\n\n   But occasionally, the computer flashes the word ``NITRO.'' That\nmeans it has detected organic molecules _ chains of carbon atoms\nwith other atoms attached, such as nitrogen _ characteristic of the\nexplosive nitroglycerine.\n\n\n   Fortunately, in all such cases to date at the San Francisco\nairport, the passenger has proven to be innocent of evil intent. He\nor she is really transporting nitroglycerine, but it's the kind\nused in trace amounts to treat heart disease.\n\n\n   Also, the device sometimes flags innocent passengers who have\nbeen exposed to organic molecules used for legitimate purposes, as\nin farming or construction work, airport spokesman Ron Wilson said.\n\n\n   The device, manufactured by Lockheed Martin in Manassas, Va.,\nalso can identify TNT and other common explosives.\n\n\n   ``What it's looking for is any of the atoms given off by an\nexplosive material. It's like being around an orange: You know the\norange is there because you can smell it a little bit,'' said Bob\nCollins, president of the Aviation Crime Prevention Institute in\nHagerstown, Md.\n\n\n   Not all luggage is selected for ``sniffing.'' Airport security\npersonnel say that passengers are ``randomly'' selected for\nsniffing.\n\n\n   ``It will not detect a knife,'' said Romila Deo, operations\nmanager for the checkpoint at the San Francisco airport's Concourse\nE.\n\n\n   The San Francisco airport was the first in the nation to test\nthe explosive trace detector, Wilson said. The devices cost from\n$50,000 to $60,000 each.",

And the\nsight of three airline captains hovering over a table of pink\nlingerie at Victoria's Secret still draws a second glance.\n\n\n   But such scenes are quietly becoming as integral to air travel\nas jet lag, weather delays and nondairy creamer. A number of\nairports, somewhat surreal spaces where travelers were once content\nto buy a few magazines and stare nervously at a clock, are starting\nto look a lot like malls.\n\n\n   In the last few years, dozens of national retailers have opened\nairport shops, invading what has long been the domain of\nnewsstands, duty-free shops and the occasional live lobster stand\nby establishing small outposts of the Gap, Victoria's Secret and\nthe like. At least one store, Altitunes, operates only in airports.\nSuch stores are joined by a full array of food chains, including\nStarbucks and Legal Sea Foods.\n\n\n   The strategy makes some sense. Many retailers have saturated the\nnation's malls and downtowns, and are desperate for new places to\nset up shop. And with both business and leisure travel at a\ndecade-long high, a lot of airports are scurrying to freshen up\ntheir terminals.\n\n\n   Running a business in an airport, though, can be a logistical\nnightmare. In no mall in America, for instance, are food merchants\nforced to take a dozen heads of lettuce through security. Many\nworkers balk at commuting to an airport. And customers often breeze\nby shops in rushing to the gate.\n\n\n   But for all the headaches, airport stores can be profitable:\nSales per square foot are often three or four times as high as\nthose for stores in other locations, even though prices are the\nsame as at malls. And ubiquitous delays coupled with the increased\nsecurity measures that force travelers to get to airports earlier\nthese days means these shoppers-in-motion often have more spare\ntime on their hands. Managers at Ronald Reagan Washington National\nAirport say annual sales average $950 a square foot, more than\nthree times the business in an average mall store, where the figure\ntends to be closer to $250 to $300.\n\n\n   Airports from Heathrow, outside London, to Pittsburgh\nInternational to La Guardia in New York to National have undergone\nmajor renovations in recent years in which the addition of new\nstores has played a key role. Others, like Chicago's O'Hare, are\nfollowing suit.\n\n\n   While most American retailers have mall life down to a science,\nthough, they are finding that running a shop in an airport is\nanother story entirely.\n\n\n   For one thing, airport rents are at least 20 percent higher,\nusually paid out as a percentage of sales. And shoppers are likely\nto spend only moments browsing.\n\n\n   ``Airport retail is a tough business operationally,'' said\nJudith Byrd, a principal with Unison Consulting Group, an airport\nconsultant in Chicago. ``The hours are longer, the rents are\nhigher. And you have to have an understanding of the market and\nairline passenger flows.''\n\n\n   Many retailing problems are unique to airports, like how to get\nmerchandise through customs and security and onto a selling floor\nthat is at most half the size of a company's average store.\n\n\n   But others are similar to what every retailer faces, with some\ntwists. Location is usually the most important factor in a\nretailer's success, but with airport shops, location has as much to\ndo with which airline a shop is parked next to as with what city\nthe airport is in and which department store is nearby.\n\n\n   People who study airport retailing say the best-performing\nstrips are in hub airports, where lots of passengers are changing\nplanes and are thus forced to linger. Heavy international traffic\nis a big plus. And it is always better to have the shops located\nafter the security point.\n\n\n   ``Everybody is in a rush to get to the airport,'' said Michael\nBell, president of BAA PLC's American unit, which manages the shops\nat Pittsburgh airport, one of the first American airports to entic",

I'd rather do it than \nget ripped off of my luggage.'' \n\n\n\tThe federal government requires the baggage questions at  \ncheck-in and the constant reminders about unattended luggage. \n\n\n\tBut security at the end of a trip -- in the baggage claim areas --  \nis the responsibility of individual airlines. They typically lease \nand operate baggage belts from an airport authority. Airlines, in \nturn, say they provide checkpoints where they are needed. \n\n\n\t``If we don't have a high incidence of problems, we don't do  \nit,'' said United Airlines spokesman Joe Hopkins. ``It helps keep \ndown the cost of air travel.'' \n\n\n\tSome airports like Hartsfield in Atlanta or Miami International  \nprovide baggage area security in many terminals as a basic service \nto their airline tenants. Atlanta, which handles 200,000 passengers \na day, spends about $1.5 million annually on it. \n\n\n\tAs a result, said Hartsfield spokeswoman Lanii Thomas, the  \nairport does not have a high rate of baggage theft. \n\n\n\tAirports generally don't keep track of stolen bags, deferring to  \nthe airlines. The carriers themselves are loath to report a bag as \nstolen, preferring to say that it is ``missing.'' Often a bag that \nhas been reported stolen ends up back at its intended destination \nafter a journey on the wrong flight. \n\n\n\tThe Transportation Department tracks mishandled bags -- those  \nthat are lost, damaged, delayed or ``pilfered.'' In March, the \nmajor U.S. airlines had about five reports of mishandled bags for \nevery 1,000 they handled, about the same as the year before. \n\n\n\tTightening security at baggage claim areas is not always  \nfoolproof. \n\n\n\tIn 1996, Los Angeles police arrested a man who allegedly raided  \nthe airline baggage belts at Los Angeles International and walked \naway with 11 sets of golf clubs, professional camera equipment, a \nsnowboard and other items worth an estimated $20,000. \n\n\n\tWhile the airport had and continues to use a bag-matching  \nprogram, the suspect found a way around it: He wore a Delta Air \nLines pilot uniform and a fake ID and strode confidently past the \ncheckout gates.",

They left their suitcases behind while going to the \nbathroom or they asked someone else to watch their baggage, or they \nleft jewelry behind while they were washing their hands,'' said \nAvry Dodson, who as director of the Department of Public Safety \noversees Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. \n\n\n\t``People are leaving valuables in plain view,'' said Benjamin  \nDeCosta, general manager of Hartsfield Atlanta International \nAirport. \n\n\n\tMost airport security is focused on major breaches, such as  \nterrorism. The amount of crime at the nation's airports is not \nmonitored by any federal agencies unless it has a special relation \nto aviation safety. \n\n\n\t``Security is through the Federal Aviation Administration, but  \nthat's oriented only to terrorism and contraband goods that \nthreaten flights,'' said Bill Mosley, a spokesman with the \nDepartment of Transportation. \n\n\n\tThe airlines do report mishandled baggage, which could be  \nstolen, but otherwise ``street'' crime is considered a local issue \nand not monitored on a national level, he said. \n\n\n\tInstead, law enforcement concentrates on the trends it finds in  \nits own backyard. \n\n\n\tAt Hartsfield, the world's busiest airport with about 73.5  \nmillion passengers annually, larceny is the crime of the year. \nAccording to police statistics compiled by The Atlanta \nJournal-Constitution, theft has climbed 26 percent for the first \nfour months this year. \n\n\n\tCar thefts also have gone up, doubling from 107 in 1997 to 215  \nlast year. \n\n\n\tA 9 percent increase in passenger volume could be partly to  \nblame for the rising thefts, but DeCosta said he's investigating \nwhether a theft ring is canvassing the airport. \n\n\n\tAt D-FW, missing vehicles are the bigger problem.  \n\n\n\t``In the last year we had 180 vehicles stolen from rental  \nagencies,'' said Dodson. ``These are not random thefts. Most of \nthese are employee related. We recover over 80 percent of the \nrental cars that are stolen.'' \n\n\n\tAirline employees also have sometimes been the issue when theft  \noccurs. \n\n\n\tThis April at D-FW, 10 baggage handlers were arrested for  \nstealing property from about 500 bags bound for flights on American \nTrans Air, British Airways, Korean Airlines and Lufthansa. \n\n\n\tIn 1998, a group of baggage handlers at American Airlines in  \nMiami were arrested after a 19-member special security team did a \nsting operation. The 44 baggage handlers were accused of pilfering \nthousands of pieces of jewelry, electronic equipment, cameras and \ncash from inside suitcases as planes arrived and departed. \n\n\n\tBut those aren't the majority of theft cases; much of the  \nstealing is done right in front of the passenger. \n\n\n\tEarlier this year at D-FW a man was charged with habitually  \nstealing those black-wheeled bags that look similar to dozens of \nothers on the baggage carousel. \n\n\n\tHis modus operandi was to steal the common-looking bags and  \nplead ignorance if stopped by the rightful owner. \n\n\n\t``The guy had been making a living out here,'' said Dodson.  \n``He'd been stopped by people but always bluffed his way through.'' \n\n\n\tAltogether, he pirated about $1 million of loot to sell at flea  \nmarkets and a couple of warehouses full of stuff before he was \ncaught. \n\n\n\tAirports in New York have a much bigger problem with pickpockets  \nthan many other cities and police have conducted several sting \noperations to catch regular thieves, according to Bill Cahill, \nspokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. \n\n\n\tMeanwhile, Chicago O'Hare International Airport, which handled  \n72.5 million passengers last year, seems to have the most trouble \nin its bathrooms. \n\n\n\tThefts in airport restrooms have risen 99 percent at O'Hare as  \nmost property crimes decreased. \n\n\n\tOne thing that is rare at airports",

Testifying before the House Appropriations\nCommittee's panel on transportation and related agencies, the\nauditors reported Wednesday they were able to bypass secured areas\nand even board the planes.\n\n\nThe agency sets guidelines and establishes procedures for\nsecurity, while airports are responsible for controlling access to\nsecured areas within the facility. Airlines oversee passengers and\ncargo. Airports and airlines together have historically been\nresponsible for maintaining security equipment and systems.",

He would not specify what measures had been\ntaken.\n\t   Israel radio said cars entering Ben Gurion airport were being\nchecked more closely and some delays were reported in getting into\nthe airport.\n\t   In a related development, the Haaretz daily said that metal\ndetectors at Ben Gurion do not pick up certain items that contain\nmetal, including kitchen knives and big key chains.\n\t   Haaretz tested the five metal detectors in the departure hall\ntwice and found that the equipment did not pick up on metal items\nweighing about 350 grams, or a little over half a pound.\n\t   Shis said security officials are aware that metal detectors\ncannot alert security to every metal object.\n\t   ``Metal detectors are not the final answer in preventing terror\nattacks,'' Shis told The Associated Press. ``The machines are only\none link in an entire chain of security measures.''\n\t   Shis would not specify which other means are used to check if a\nperson is carrying weapons.\n\t   Security measures at Ben Gurion are among the most stringent\nworldwide. Motorists are stopped at checkpoints at the airport\nentrances, with some passengers _ generally Palestinians _ being\nquestioned there and having their luggage checked.\n\t   In the departure lounge, tourists, Palestinians and Israeli Arab\ncitizens are questioned at length, while Jewish Israelis usually\nundergo only a perfunctory check.\n &UR; lc-kl",

Miller said it's important to note that most crimes at the\ngarage have been crimes of property, like car prowls, and not rapes\nor assaults.\n\n\n   And that leaves little reason for boosting garage staffing, said\nAviation director Gina Marie Lindsey.\n\n\n   ``History doesn't seem to warrant throwing a lot of folks and\ntechnology at the garage,'' Lindsey said.\n\n\n   A woman shot two years ago in the huge Sea-Tac garage is suing\nthe port for negligence, but port officials say no security\nmeasures could prevent that kind of sudden attack.\n\n\n   But interviews with police at other airports around the country\nshow that they devote special resources to keeping their garages as\nsafe as possible.\n\n\n   Police at Washington's Dulles aim cameras to cover every blind\nspot at the lot.

John Bangs. ``Every garage gets patrolled at\nleast a couple of times every shift.''\n\n\n   Documents filed with the lawsuit indicate that the Sea-Tac\ngarage is not routinely patrolled, though officers from other beats\nsometimes make checks there.\n\n\n   Officials at other airports _ as well as nationally recognized\nexperts on parking _ say garages require special vigilence. They're\nwhere people leave one of their most valuable and treasure-filled\npossessions, and any theft that's interrupted has the potential to\nturn violent.\n\n\n   ``Security should be at the top of the mind of anyone who's\noffering parking to the public,'' said Brad Parrish, president of\nV.P.

(AP) -- Northwest Airlines paid or has pending  \nmore than $120,000 in fines for security breaches at Detroit \nMetropolitan Airport in the past two years, federal records show. \nTwice, agents were able to sneak dynamite bombs past airport \ncheckpoints. \n\n\n\tNorthwest has paid $21,500 in settling four breaches since 1997  \nand has $99,000 in finds pending for nine other lapses, The Detroit \nNews reported today, citing Federal Aviation Administration records \nobtained through the Freedom of Information Act. A 14th violation \nwas found but the level of fine was not yet set. \n\n\n\tAmong violations cited in the records:  \n\n\n\t--On Aug. 24, 1997, Northwest flew the checked bag of a federal  \naviation agent on a flight from the airport to Toronto. The special \nagent wasn't on the flight or any other headed to Toronto. \nNorthwest settled the complaint for $5,000. \n\n\n\t--Undercover FAA agents successfully sneaked dynamite bombs  \nthrough checkpoints during September 1997 tests -- once because a \nsecurity guard was talking to a co-worker instead of looking at a \nmonitor to check a briefcase's contents. The airline paid $10,500 \nin fines. \n\n\n\t--A Nov. 6 security breach prompted by an unidentified man who  \navoided a checkpoint and walked through an exit-only door after a \nsecurity guard failed to watch the door while reading a book. Fines \nwere pending. \n\n\n\tFAA officials told the News that the number of citations was  \nrelatively high, though they stressed it can vary based on the \nnumber of undercover operations conducted at an airport. \n\n\n\tFAA regional spokesman Tony Molinaro said the agency is ``much  \nhappier with the airport's security plan in the past three \nmonths,'' since a new security company was hired and safety \nmeasures were enhanced. \n\n\n\tIn March, Northwest canceled the contract of its security  \ncompany, Atlanta-based Argenbright Security Inc., in favor of \nHuntleigh Corp., which took over April 1. \n\n\n\tNorthwest spokesman Jon Austin declined to address specific  \nincidents, noting that fines are routinely reduced. \n\n\n\t``We're always concerned about security and work daily with the  \nFAA on the subject,'' he said. ``We want the FAA to test our \nprocedures and personnel so that we can identify and implement \nimprovements.'' \n\n\n\tDave Katz, Wayne County's airport director, said the change in  \ncompanies has enhanced Northwest's security. \n\n\n\t``We get more than a million passengers in here a month. It's  \npretty hard to bat 100 percent when it comes to security,'' he \nsaid. ``This is a safe airport, and Northwest is a safe airline.'' \n\n\n\tLinda Newman, an Argenbright spokeswoman in Atlanta, did not  \nreturn several telephone calls, the News reported.",

      "content": "EX-TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL SAYS HER BAG CAUSED DELAYS AT\nAIRPORT  \n\n\n\n   WASHINGTON _ A former Transportation Department official\nacknowledged Sunday that she was the person who checked a suitcase\nat the airport in Columbus, Ohio, on Friday that security officials\nsuspected contained a bomb.\n\n\n   The former official, Mary Schiavo, said that her aim was to help\na local television station prepare a story about security, not to\ndisrupt operations at the airport.\n\n\n   The airport police evacuated the ``B'' concourse at Port\nColumbus airport, ordering hundreds of travelers from the area, and\nplanes were pushed back from their gates. The bomb squad took the\nbag to a pre-designated spot on the north runway and closed the\nrunway for five hours. The FBI and the Federal Aviation\nAdministration have joined the investigation.\n\n\n   Ms. Schiavo is a former inspector general of the Transportation\nDepartment, and before she left her job in 1996 she issued many\nreports critical of the FAA, including several on security.\n\n\n   In a telephone interview Sunday, Ms. Schiavo said that she had\nbeen at the airport, which is near her home, with WCMH-TV, an NBC\naffiliate in Columbus.\n\n\n   ``They wanted me to go with them to tell them what I thought of\nsecurity,'' said Ms. Schiavo, who said she had done the same last\nyear with ``local print media.''\n\n\n   Airport police and the FBI complained on Saturday that the\nincident had disrupted the airport operations for hours, and said\nthey were investigating whether any laws were broken.\n\n\n   Asked Sunday if airport officials were mad at her, Ms. Schiavo\nsaid, ``they are, but they were mad at me before.''\n\n\n   Ms. Schiavo said she was trying to prove a point, that bags\nchecked by passengers are not routinely X-rayed before they are\nloaded, and that they should be.\n\n\n   She said airport officials had been tipped off by the television\ncrew that she was testing their safety arrangements, and had made\nas big a fuss as possible over the checked bag.\n\n\n   But Chief Richard L. Morgan, the director of public safety at\nthe airport, said the bag had been pulled aside because airline\nworkers had become suspicious. ``I find it ironic that as the hours\ngo by, she comes up with more allegations,'' he said.\n\n\n   ``We feel we have probable cause that possible criminal\nviolations were involved here,'' he said, but added that the FBI\nwould decide whether to press charges.\n\n\n   Asked if Ms. Schiavo had some long-standing dispute with his\ndepartment, he said, ``My understanding is that she has a beef with\nthe FAA and airports in general.''\n\n\n   Officials in Washington said the bag may have been pulled aside\nbecause Ms. Schiavo did not board. She said Sunday she had a second\nticket to Washington on a different flight that day.\n\n\n   In any case, America West workers carried the bag up to the\nscreening checkpoint usually used for carry-ons, and screeners\nbecame alarmed about what they saw on X-ray.\n\n\n   Ms. Schiavo stressed that it was not she who had taken the bag\ninto the concourse, and that ``it was certainly, certainly not my\nintent'' to disrupt the airport.\n\n\n   The bag had a running suit and shoes, a tape recorder, a can of\nshaving cream, a can for racquetball balls, children's modeling\nclay and wire for stereo speakers, she said.\n\n\n   The cans and the wire, she said, should have attracted the\nattention of a security screener if the bag had been X-rayed; the\nclay, she said, would not appear suspicious on X-ray but would show\nthat the bag could just as easily held explosives.",

      "content": "NEW YORK _ After TWA Flight 800 exploded off Long Island in July\n1996, initial fears that the jumbo jet had been brought down by a\nterrorist bomb prompted the Clinton administration and Congress to\ndemand that security at the nation's airports be improved.\n\n\n   Legislation was adopted. A down payment of $400 million was\nappropriated for bomb detection machines. The Federal Aviation\nAdministration was given several months to produce a report on how\nto redesign the country's air travel security system. A commission\nheaded by Vice President Al Gore urged airlines to pay their\nsecurity personnel better wages to upgrade the quality of\nperformance.\n\n\n   But more than three years later, as investigators are again\nasking whether a plane fell from the sky because of a mechanical\nfailure or an act of sabotage, critics of the FAA and the airline\nindustry, within and outside of government, say the safety\nimprovements achieved at airports across the country have been\nmodest at best.\n\n\n   The FAA, for example, took two years, not three months, to\nproduce its report on how the industry and its regulators could\nbetter ensure security; the $1 million state-of-the-art detection\ndevices used to examine baggage at 80 airports are being badly\nunderused, according to a 1999 government audit; that same audit\nalso found that efforts to limit access to airplanes on the ground\nby unauthorized people was no better than it had been three years\nago.\n\n\n   ``When you talk about progress since 1996, I don't think much\nhas been done,'' said a former member of the Gore Commission who\nworked for months on pushing reforms and who spoke on the condition\nof anonymity.\n\n\n   Of course officials now believe that TWA Flight 800 was not\nbrought down by a bomb, and there is no evidence that EgyptAir 990,\nthe Boeing 767 that tumbled out of the sky last Sunday morning\nshortly after taking off from Kennedy International Airport, was\nthe victim of sabotage.\n\n\n   But there is no evidence, either, that a mechanical failure\ncaused the EgyptAir crash. And so as the search for an answer goes\non, investigators are interviewing security personnel at JFK and at\nLos Angeles International Airport, the 767's initial takeoff site,\nexamining passenger lists and, in their own urgent way, taking\nstock of whether things at the airports are any better than they\nwere in 1996.\n\n\n   For their part, the FAA and airline officials point out that no\nairplane departing from the United States has ever been destroyed\nby a bomb. And they add that they have, in fact, made progress in\nimproving security _ though some delays were unavoidable _ and that\nthey are using the high-tech baggage checkers as frequently as is\npractically possible.\n\n\n   And there are legislators who support the claims of progress.\n\n\n   Rep. James Oberstar of Minnesota, who is the ranking Democrat on\nthe House Transportation Committee, said the FAA was doing ``a very\ngood job.''\n\n\n   But the evidence shows that the problems the agency has faced in\nbeefing up security are similar to those that have plagued it\nbefore, most famously in its long-delayed efforts to modernize the\nnation's air traffic control system. The agency, according to its\ncritics and even some of its supporters, is often immobilized by\nits attempts to seek consensus among the various public and private\ninterests it is supposed to be regulating.\n\n\n   One priority established after the crash of TWA Flight 800 was\nthe greater use of high-technology explosive-detection devices. In\nthe fall of 1996, Congress appropriated $144 million for the FAA to\nbuy the machines.\n\n\n   To date, 136 of a total of 400 explosive-detection devices, each\ncosting about $1 million, have been deployed at 80 airports. In\naddition, about 600 machines that are used to detect traces of\nexplosives in carry-on luggage are also in use.\n\n\n   But an audit by the Department of Transportation's inspector\ngeneral published earlier this year found that the machines were\nvastly underused by airlines, which are responsible for screening\nbaggage.

In the \nsecond, 15 workers for other companies were charged with smuggling \ncocaine aboard planes. \n\n\n\tIn both cases, ramp workers used their security badges to gain  \naccess to airfields and restricted areas, carrying their goods \ninside knapsacks on work shifts and days off.",

A U.S. travel advisory in 1985 produced\ndevastating results: the number of visits that year dropped to\njust 100,000 from 600,000 in 1984.\n\n\nGreek Prime Minister Costas Simitis reportedly intervened to\nstop the U.S. from issuing a travel advisory but Greek tour\noperators say that even with the less formal warning stickers,\nyears of effort to regain trust in the U.S. market could be\nwasted.\n\n\nOther senior officials, including the country's Transport\nMinister Haris Kastanidis, have also lashed out at the American\naction. Speaking to the press earlier, Kastanidis said Washington\nwas using the warning as a means of political pressure on Athens,\nand warned that Athens considered the issue of warning stickers\n\"a hostile act against our country.\"\n\n\n\"The Americans should first take a look at their own statistics\nof the terrorist actions taking place at their airports and then\nconcern themselves with the Athens airport, which is among the\nsafest in the world,\" Michalis Perros, head of Greece's Civil\nAviation Union was quoted as saying by local press reports today.\n\n\nIt was reported that a group of U.S. travel experts are due to\ncome to Athens to inspect the airport but the Greek Transport\nMinistry was considering whether they would permit the visit.\n\n\nGovernment spokesman Reppas said Prime Minister Simitis had\nrequested the lifting of the U.S. warning during a meeting with\nAmbassador Niles today and Niles promised that every effort would\nbe made to \"resolve the issue within 30 days.\"",

With this accountability, the\nFAA believes the companies and the employees will perform better.\n\n\n   To evaluate performance, the FAA is using a system that projects\nelectronic images of guns, knives and explosives into bags being\nX-rayed.

But Chief Richard L. Morgan, director of\npublic safety at the Columbus Airport Authority, said that\npreliminary evidence tied the bag to Mary Schiavo, a former\ninspector general of the U.S. Department of Transportation who had\nbeen critical of the Federal Aviation Administration on airport\nsecurity issues.\n\n\n   Morgan said that his department, which called in the Federal\nBureau of Investigation, had not verified that the bag was Ms.\nSchiavo's or that she had had a ticket on the flight to Washington\non which it was checked. Nor did he describe the evidence linking\nher to the bag.\n\n\n   Ms. Schiavo lives in the Columbus area but does not have a\nlisted telephone number.\n\n\n   Two Washington officials speaking on the condition of anonymity\nsaid that the object found in the bag appeared to have been\nintended to look like a bomb.\n\n\n   Morgan and a spokesman for the FBI in Washington, Frank Scafidi,\nsaid that it was not clear if any law had been violated but that\nairport operations had been disrupted for hours.\n\n\n   ``It sure caused a hell of a mess out there,'' Scafidi said. The\nFranklin County bomb squad took the bag to the north runway,\nclosing it from 5:30 p.m. until 10:30 p.m.\n\n\n   At the Federal Aviation Administration, Paul Takemoto, a\nspokesman, said only that ``we are aware there's been a security\nincident at Port Columbus.''\n\n\n   According to officials of law enforcement agencies,\ntransportation agencies and America West, the airline accepted a\nbag at the check-in counter for its 2:58 p.m. flight from Port\nColumbus International Airport to National Airport in Washington\nbut became suspicious when the passenger who had checked the bag\ndid not board the plane.\n\n\n   Most checked bags are not X-rayed. They are supposed to be\nscanned if the airline does not know enough about the passenger, or\nif there is some other cause for suspicion, like a passenger's not\nboarding.\n\n\n   Patty Nowack, a spokeswoman for America West, would say only\nthat the bag ``was not loaded on the aircraft, in compliance with\nFederal Aviation Administration rules.''\n\n\n   Several planes, including a Boeing 747 belonging to Air India,\nhave been destroyed in flight by bombs placed in checked baggage by\npeople who posed as passengers but did not board.\n\n\n   Morgan said of Ms. Schiavo, ``Her name has been mentioned many\ntimes'' in connection with the incident. ``The information I had\nwas she was going to be on TV in Washington,'' he said.\n\n\n   David V. Whittaker, a spokesman for the airport authority, said,\n``it was not an explosive device.'' But screeners ``did believe it\nwas'' when they saw it on X-ray, he said.\n\n\n   When Ms. Schiavo was inspector general she issued many reports\ncritical of the Federal Aviation Administration, which is part of\nthe Transportation Department. Her book, ``Flying Blind,'' was\npublished in 1996, shortly after she resigned from the department.\n\n\n   Some of her most scathing criticism of the FAA was on security\nissues. She said in an audit in September 1996 that FAA agents\noverstated how well airports did on security tests, and made\nefforts to help airports do well on the inspections.",

They will be able to direct lost\nmotorists and lend a uniformed presence in the garage.\n\n\n   (BBOX)Offering Block Watch-style training in coming weeks to\nairport and airline workers to help them spot security problems and\nknow how to respond.\n\n\n   (BBOX)Modifying emergency telephones in the next three weeks to\ntransmit to dispatchers the caller's exact location.\n\n\n   (BBOX)Replacing the lamps in older sections of the garage and\nredesigning the garage's lighting to eliminate severe contrast\nbetween dark and light areas.\n\n\n   Only the lighting project was given a specific pricetag: $4.5\nmillion, an allocation that will require approval by the port\ncommission in about two months.\n\n\n   Studies on how to improve the lighting had long been under way,\nLindsey said, but the project probably would not have been launched\nfor another year without the recent publicity.\n\n\n   The added police patrols in the garage began about four weeks\nago, she said. The other safety measures will be launched as soon\nas possible.\n\n\n   In addition, she said, port officials also are studying\nlonger-term security changes such as installing a network of\nsecurity cameras.\n\n\n   The only cameras now in the garage are used to check maintenance\nconditions around the elevators. In the coming weeks, Lindsey said,\nthe facilities personnel who monitor those cameras will be trained\nto spot and report security problems, as well.\n\n\n   Lindsey presented the security improvements as part of a larger\npackage of ``customer-service'' upgrades.\n\n\n   The eight-story airport garage _ which Sea-Tac officials believe\nto be the largest single parking structure in the nation _ is\nbulging at the seams. It handled four million cars last year, which\ncarried many of the 25.8 million people who flew through Sea-Tac.\nLast year, the structure generated a $34 million profit.\n\n\n   The garage regularly fills up twice a week _ typically midday\nWednesdays and Thursdays _ and the congestion is only getting\nworse.\n\n\n   A hotline (206-433-5308) alerts motorists to sold-out\nsituations, alternative parking locales, and other conditions. The\nairport's website (www.portseattle.org/seatac) will be upgraded by\nlate May to do the same.\n\n\n   Airport officials also promise to have in place by October a\nspeedy pay-on-the-way-to-your-car exit system, and to add 3,000 new\nparking stalls by July 2000.\n\n\n   As to security, port Police Chief Patrick Kasnick said the\nairport garage is as safe as the surrounding community.\n\n\n   Not counting crimes involving its rental cars, he said Sea-Tac's\ngarage has one-fourth as much crime",

India will never be cowed down by\nsuch barbaric acts,\" Vajpayee told the media at his residence.\n\n\nThe hijacked Indian Airlines plane with 161 passengers and crew\nstill on board landed in southern Afghan city of Kandahar, some\n650 km from Kabul, Saturday morning.",

At the Dallas/Fort Worth airport in 1995, an\nFAA agent with a weapon strapped to the small of his back set off a\nmetal detector. The screener used a hand wand.\n\n\n   The investigation showed that the screener, who was on only his\nthird shift, had not completed training; he didn't realize that\nwhen the agent spread his arms, his jacket stood away from his\nback, shielding the gun from detection.\n\n\n   At the other extreme, a screener at Cleveland Hopkins\nInternational Airport failed to detect a weapon smuggled in by\nanother agent in 1995, and USAir asked for leniency because the\nscreener had been on the job four years. That, said the airline in\na letter to the FAA, constituted ``extensive experience (in terms\nof screener turnover).'' In this context, four years is a lengthy\ncareer.\n\n\n   At the checkpoint, ``the ability of people to find things on the\nX-ray screen is shockingly low,'' said Dr. Michael Cantor, a\npsychologist formerly employed at Argenbright, one of the nation's\nlargest airport security contractors. Some people are\ndetail-oriented and are very good at spotting guns or bombs. Others\nhave other useful traits, he said, being ``highly extroverted'' and\nwilling to challenge people who are often of higher social status.\n\n\n   ``But supervisors are not savvy,'' Dr. Cantor said. ``They don't\ndo a division of labor.'' Workers rotate between viewing the X-ray\nscreen and the other checkpoint jobs. Cantor developed a quick test\nto find detail-oriented people but could not persuade the FAA to\nuse it.\n\n\n   People are, in fact, the weak spot in the system. Airlines and\nthe FAA are installing more and more high-tech machines to scan\nbags, but the airlines do not always send the bags through.\nMechanics, baggage handlers and others often fail to wear required\nidentification, or fail to challenge persons not wearing it.\n\n\n   It is hard, experts say, to stay vigilant about a threat that is\nintermittent at best. It's like looking through a haystack that\nmight have a needle in it. The FAA is even considering a checkpoint\nsystem that would periodically show an X-ray image of a bag with a\ngun in it, just to keep screeners on their toes.",

Derman reportedly has the\nwispy beginnings of a beard.\n\n\n   ``That is an obvious failure of security,'' said an aviation\nsecurity specialist who spoke on condition that his name not be\nused.\n\n\n   Derman, of suburban Brookline, scaled a perimeter fence, walked\nunchallenged for 2 miles across restricted areas, including at\nleast one active taxiway, and gained access to the 747 jet by\nclimbing the outside stairs of the jetway, an enlosed walkway\nconnecting the airport boarding area and the aircraft's doorway,\nand passing through a door that should have been locked.\n\n\n   Two sources said Derman reached the plane by using the exterior\nstairs to the jetway from the tarmac after a ramp mechanic propped\nthe door open.\n\n\n   He hid on the tarmac near the airplane and made a well-timed\ndash up the stairs as the first group of passengers boarded Flight\n214, British Airways's daily 8:10 p.m. flight to London.\n\n\n   A source familiar with the investigation into Derman's trip said\nthe teenager reads spy novels and hoped to impress the Mossad, the\nIsraeli intelligence agency, with his stunt. Derman wanted to fly\non to Israel from London's Heathrow International Airport.\n\n\n   His attempt ended after Heathrow airport security discovered\nDerman in a restricted area.\n\n\n   Sources also said Thursday that the teen was thwarted at least\nonce, and possibly as many as five times, by airport personnel\nearlier July 12 when he first tried to gain access to the tarmac\nfrom inside Terminal E.\n\n\n   ``He'd be in a restricted baggage handling area and someone\nwould confront him and he'd say, `I'm lost.' The kid looks like he\nis 13,'' said one source familiar with the investigation.\n\n\n   The airport is owned and operated by the Massachusetts Port\nAuthority.\n\n\n   After being turned back by airport workers inside the Logan\nterminal, Derman walked along a perimeter fence north of the\nairport, then climbed the fence and either cut the razor wire on\ntop or found a section in which the wire was torn and jumped down\nonto the airfield.\n\n\n   Airport employees, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said\nthey have been instructed to question anyone not familiar to them\nwho is in a restricted area and ask for their identification no\nmatter their age.\n\n\n   One source said Thursday that when Derman entered the airplane,\nhe first sat in a seat reserved for flight attendants.\n\n\n   After an attendant told him to take his assigned seat, he moved\nto a coach seat that belonged to someone else. Forced to yield the\ncoach seat, Derman moved to the more upscale business section and\nstayed there for the flight to Europe.\n\n\n   The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating the\nincident and could levy fines against Massport, British Airways,\nand Derman himself.\n\n\n   Security specialists said Derman's ability to breach the fence\nat Logan is not remarkable because most US airports do not monitor\nperimeter fences with cameras or electronic sensors.\n\n\n   At least twice in the past year unauthorized individuals have\ngained access to ramp areas at Logan. In both cases the individuals\nwere arrested.\n\n\n   State officials have said they will not bring criminal charges\nagainst Derman because of his age and because his parents\nunderstand the severity of his actions.\n\n\n   &QL; \n(Globe staff member Thomas C.

      "content": "Opening of Gaza airport marks emotional day for Palestinians\n\n\n\t   DAHANIEH, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Thousands of Palestinians watched\nbreathlessly as the first Palestine Airlines flight touched down at\nGaza International Airport Tuesday and crew members waved the\nnational green, red, black and white flag from the pilot's window.\n\t   And then, with many holding back tears of joy, the emotional\ncrowd began a spontaneous celebration of dance and song set to last\nfor days. The opening of their first airport was a concrete sign\nfor Palestinians that their lives were becoming freer and their\nhomeland was moving one step closer to statehood.\n\t   ``The meaning of the airport is freedom and the feeling that you\nare a citizen in a country,'' said Shaban Khalil, a 47-year-old man\nfrom Gaza City.\n\t   Gaza International, built with dlrs 75 million in contributions\nmainly from Japan, is petite for an international airport. Sprawled\nover 1,125-acres, it has one runway long enough to accommodate all\nbut the biggest jumbo jets. The one passenger terminal for arrivals\nand departures resembles an Arabian desert palace with arches and\nmulticolored Moroccan tiles and includes a VIP lounge.\n\t   In the first weeks, airport operations will have to rely on some\nimprovisation. Major pieces of equipment, including the controls\nfor the control tower, are still at the Israeli port of Ashdod.\nTuesday's planes were guided to a safe landing by a portable\ncontrol panel installed in a van.\n\t   Israel, which feared a solely-Palestinian run airport would mean\nenemies could land at its door-step or smuggle weapons to the\nPalestinians, held up the opening for two years over security.\n\t   Under the airport agreement, Israel will continue to control the\nairspace and could shut down the airport at any time. With a\nfull-time but discreet monitoring presence there, Israel will\npre-approve all flight schedules and passenger lists. No Israeli\nwill sit in the control tower or operate any area of the airport.\n\t   Tuesday, Israeli and Palestinian security agents greeted an\nEgypt Air flight and collected the passports of the passengers,\nincluding Egyptian Cabinet ministers in small white bags.\n\t   As of Wednesday, Palestinian officials say no Israeli presence\nwill be visible. Arriving passengers will be transferred by buses\nfrom the planes to a security check area in the airport where they\nwill go through metal detectors. Palestinian agents will X-Ray\nluggage and cargo while Israeli monitors observe the security\nchecks from behind one-way mirrors, as they do now at two other\ncrossings into autonomous Palestinian areas.\n\t   If Israel disputes an inspection, the passenger and his luggage\nwill be taken to a separate area where Israelis will carry out an\nadditional check while Palestinian agents observe.\n\t   Palestine Airlines, which already runs a twice-weekly flight to\nJordan from a small airstrip in Egypt, will now operate out of Gaza\nInternational. The brand-new national carrier is starting out with\na fleet of three planes including a Boeing 727 _ a gift from a\nSaudi prince.\n\t   The airport will also be the permanent home of Yasser Arafat's\npresidential plane. A giant portrait of the Palestinian leader hung\nfrom the control tower for the festive opening Tuesday and Arafat\nwas on hand to personally greet seven plane-loads of dignitaries.\n\t   ``This is a preparation for the declaration of the Palestinian\nstate,'' Arafat said, smiling broadly and flashing a V sign.\n\t   Next month, U.S. President Bill Clinton is expected to land\nthere too _ giving implicit recognition for independence, at least\nin Palestinian eyes\n\t   Tuesday's opening was a dramatic event in the history of the\nPalestinian people.

      "content": "THOSE L-O-N-G, L-O-N-G, AIRPORT COUNTER LINES \n\n\n\n   Those long lines at U.S. airports are not just on the runways.\nAs the number of airline passengers swells _ to 614 million last\nyear, up from 488 million in 1993 _ and airports remain the same\nsize, waiting in line has become a frustrating experience. The\nairlines, hearing growing complaints and eager to cut costs, have\nbegun adopting new techniques to speed people on their way. &QL;\n\n\n   Continental Airlines and Alaska Airlines have kiosks with\ncomputer screens where passengers, using credit cards for\nidentification, can check themselves in, answer security questions\nabout who packed their luggage and whether it has been under their\ncontrol at all times, and obtain boarding passes.  &QL;\n\n\n   Alaska also has ticketing agents who roam terminals with\nportable computers that can print out boarding passes the way\nrental-car agents can issue receipts from hand-held computers. &QL;\n\n\n   Airlines are also upgrading their computer systems, which will\nreduce the time it takes to issue tickets and boarding passes. TWA\nrecently installed touch-screen computers, like those at ATM\nmachines, that allow agents to issue boarding passes faster. &QL;\n\n\n   Continental is installing new software for ticketing and gate\nagents because ``the computer software that drives reservations and\ntransaction process at the airport is 20 years old, if not 25,''\nsaid Dave Messing, a Continental spokesman. Continental's new\nsystem replaces lots of typing with point-and-click technology. &QL;\n\n\n   Penny Thomas, United's manager of in-airport service planning,\nsaid: ``The most basic rule to reduce time in line is to arrive at\nthe airport in travel-ready condition. That means you do not need\nto see anyone, to buy a ticket or to change a seat assignment. It\nmeans your only requirement is to get a boarding pass.'' &QL;\n\n\n   Here are some other strategies to reduce waiting time, some from\nairlines officials, some from veteran travelers: &QL;\n\n\n   _Curbside baggage check-in. A skycap can tag your bags and\nthey'll be gone in a matter of seconds, allowing you to go straight\nto the boarding gate, Miss Thomas said. At some airports\nContinental's kiosks are at curbside, so besides obtaining a\nboarding pass you can check your bags, which a skycap will then\ntake. Expect to tip at least $1 a bag for this convenience. &QL;\n\n\n   _Ticket counters. If you do go to a ticket counter, study the\nway the lines are arranged, said Carolyn Fennell, a spokes-woman\nfor Orlando International Airport. Often ticketed passengers have a\nseparate line where only boarding passes are issued, and that line\nusually moves quickly. Passengers in frequent-flier programs often\nhave a separate line, which is usually shorter and faster. And if\nyou have upgrade coupons for first class, get in the line for first\nclass passengers even if you expect to be told that no seats are\navailable. &QL;\n\n\n   _Security gates. Standing and waiting to have yourself and your\nluggage screened can be especially frustrating as people unfamiliar\nwith the process fumble with their gear. &QL;\n\n\n   In Orlando, where long lines are frequent because of families\nwith children on vacation, Ms. Fennell recommends looking for gates\nto the left when approaching lines of people at security\ncheckpoints, since Americans tend to line up to the right. ``So\nlook to the left. Maybe it is less crowded.'' &QL;\n\n\n   Many airports have more than one security checkpoint, and\nknowing the secondary site can save time. The Delta-Northwest\nterminal at La Guardia Airport, for example, has its main security\ncheckpoint on the right side of a gift shop. But a secondary site\non the other side of the gift shop is often open with no waiting. &QL;\n\n\n   Also, if you have no carry-ons, look for a metal detector beyond\nthe X-ray machines. If there is one, then ignore the lines and go\nstraight for that detector, Ms. Fennell said.\n\n\n   _ Boarding gates. If your boarding gate has a long line you may\nbe able to get your boarding pass from another gate, or head for\nthe customer-services desk that airlines",

Police Commissioner Howard Safir referred\nto it as ``Condition Bravo,'' which entails beefed up patrols at\nconsulates, religious institutions and other sensitive locations.\n\n\n   While Federal Aviation Administration said Friday's ``heightened\nstate of emergency'' has become standard procedure over the past\nthree years, many of the nation's largest airports stepped up\nsecurity noticeably.\n\n\n   On the West Coast, at Los Angeles International Airport,\nsecurity was increased and police said they would monitor the local\nsituation for any potential problems. Airport officials also\nadvised passengers to expect some delays due to closer screening of\nbaggage and other materials.\n\n\n   At Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, bomb-sniffing dogs\nand police officers were on increased patrols. Airport security\nofficials at Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport warned\npassengers to arrive early for their flights and not to leave their\ncars unattended or they would be towed.\n\n\n   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)\n\n\n   In Washington, U.S. Park Police ``increased patrols and\nheightened security'' at all national monuments including the\nWashington, Lincoln and Jefferson memorials and the national Mall.\n\n\n   ``It's a very political area and we have to react to what's\nhappening,'' said U.S. Park Police Capt. Valerie Fernandes.\n\n\n   The last time Fernandes recalls this type of heightened security\nwas during Operation: Desert Storm. She said the precautions are\nnot an indication that a strike is expected but that ``it's better",

      "content": "Head of problem-plagued Hong Kong airport offers to step down\n\n\n\t   HONG KONG (AP) _ The chairman of Hong Kong's problem-plagued new\nairport offered Saturday to step down once his term ends after\nrevelations of a security breach added to concerns over cargo\ndelays so severe that they could reduce economic growth.\n\t   The dlrs 20 billion Chek Lap Kok airport has provoked complaints\nsince it opened Monday about lengthy delays before passengers could\nget off airplanes or collect luggage and confusing flight\ninformation.\n\t   The chairman of the Airport Authority, Wong Po-yan, said he took\nresponsibility for the problems and offered not to seek\nreappointment when his term ends in November, government-run Radio\nHong Kong reported. There was no immediate word from Hong Kong's\nChief Executive Tung Chee-hwa.\n\t   Wong was appointed by the Hong Kong government to a three-year\nterm as head of the airport authority in 1995.\n\t   The government said Friday it would appoint two outside experts\nand an influential Hong Kong figure to investigate problems at the\nairport. Legislators criticized the proposal, saying they want a\npanel appointed by the Hong Kong legislature to ensure the\ngovernment doesn't try to conceal its own mistakes.\n\t   Dutch airline KLM revealed Friday that one of its planes\nviolated safety rules by taking off with the bags of two passengers\nwho weren't aboard. Airlines are required to remove the bags of\nabsent passengers to guard against explosives.\n\t   Automated printers that check boarding passes and baggage\nnumbers have not worked since the airport opened, forcing KLM staff\nto check passes by hand and count passengers aboard planes, said\nAlbert Chan, the KLM passenger services manager.\n\t   ``It has really been a mess,'' said Chan. ``But (the Airport\nAuthority) is doing everything possible to maintain airport\nsecurity.''\n\t   The Hong Kong government said it was investigating the misplaced\nbags but added that there was no breach of aviation security\nbecause all bags are screened before they are cleared for flight.\n\t   The company handling cargo at the airport imposed a moratorium\non new shipments this week in order to clear away a backlog.\n\t   The moratorium will cost Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals 5 million\nHong Kong dollars (dlrs 640,000) a day, said Anthony Charter, the\ncompany managing director. The company handles 5,000 tons of\nfreight daily, worth 1.7 billion Hong Kong dollars (dlrs 217\nmillion).\n\t   Delays in shipments have forced sellers of fresh seafood to\nclose.\n\t   The delays could reduce economic growth this year by 0.1\npercentage points ``provided that the period of moratorium is\nlimited to what they say,'' Financial Secretary Donald Tsang said\nlate Friday.\n\t   It was the first official estimate for losses caused by problems\nat the airport.\n\t   The airport was built on an outlying island about 30 kilometers\n(22 miles) west of the Hong Kong's city center in one of the\nworld's biggest construction projects.\n\t   Hong Kong leaders had hoped its opening would revive public\nconfidence in the midst of Asia's economic crisis. Instead, it has\ncreated a public-relations disaster.\n\t   ``On the fundamental question on whether the airport has been\nput in good hands, the answer is no,'' wrote commentator Chris\nYeung in the South China Morning Post.",

      "content": "IN THE NAME OF `RESPECT,' A SHAKEDOWN \n\n\n\n   BAKU, Azerbaijan _ This was a novel approach to airport\nsecurity.\n\n\n   It was the dark, run-down departures hall of Baku's airport,\ninside the security zone, between customs and passport control. The\ntwo men who identified themselves as ``police'' wanted a passenger\nto ``take a small package.''\n\n\n   The passenger balked. What was that line they tell you at\nairports all over the world? Never carry a bag for a stranger . . .\n\n\n   ``Don't you want to show us some respect?'' one ``officer''\nretorted.\n\n\n   The respect thing. The passenger had heard this before.\n\n\n   The airport security man, who had introduced himself as\n``Airport KGB,'' said it when he had offered to bump up an economy\nclass ticket to business class for a small fee. The airline\nrepresentative said it when he wanted to make that small fee a big\none. The customs agent a year ago said it when he had confiscated\nthe passenger's money.\n\n\n   Trying not to sound rude, the passenger declined the police\nofficer's request and prepared for the worst.\n\n\n   &QL; \n---- &QC; \n &QL;\n\n\n   Airports are a sore spot in the former Soviet Union. The Baltic\nstates have world-class airports, as does Kiev. But most seem to\noperate on two principles: ``The customer is always blight'' and\n``You can check in any time you like, but you can never leave.''\n\n\n   For attempted extortion from foreigners, Baku beats them all.\n\n\n   ``I got hit up for a little `respect' at the ticket gate by two\nAzeri cops,'' said Tom Goltz, author of ``Azerbaijan Diary: A Rogue\nReporter's Adventures in an Oil-rich, War-torn Post-Soviet\nRepublic.'' ``It was so incredibly shameless and brazen that it\nreally took me aback.''\n\n\n   What happens at the airport is indicative of the times in a\ncountry waiting to get rich from the oil under the Caspian Sea.\n\n\n   For now, most of Azerbaijan is in shambles. Many regions have no\nelectricity, and even Baku experiences water and power shortages.\nAt least 700,000 people _ one tenth of the country's population _\nare refugees from the territory Azerbaijan lost during a six-year\nwar with Armenia.\n\n\n   Some foreign money has come in, via oil companies and\nWestern-style shops and eateries that have opened to support them.\n\n\n   But little wealth has trickled down from the inner circle of\nPresident Geidar Aliyev, 75, the authoritarian former KGB general\nand Communist Party chief. The Aliyev government keeps its oil\ndealings secret and suppresses all dissent.\n\n\n   ``The biggest businesses have ties to the inner circle of\nAliyev,'' says opposition leader Etibar Mammadov. ``And corruption\nand bribery are so highly developed, there are huge obstacles to\nanyone else.''\n\n\n   That perhaps explains why Baku's airport, or at least the part\nthat is not reserved for VIPs, has no shops or cafes, which are\nnever profitable in corrupt societies. Instead of the market\nidentifying and meeting people's needs, Baku airport works on the\nold Soviet principle of letting officials do it.\n\n\n   &QL; \n----- &QC; \n &QL;\n\n\n   The police were still waiting.\n\n\n   ``OK, if you don't want to carry something for us, maybe you'll\njust pay us a small fee instead?'' one said. ``Out of respect.''\n\n\n   ``Gentlemen,'' the passenger said. ``I respect you. But I just\ngave all my money to the Airport KGB.''\n\n\n   They didn't know what to make of that. The passenger strode off\nto passport control, where the border guard was waiting.\n\n\n   &QL; \n(David Filipov is the Globe's Moscow bureau chief.)",

      "content": "Opening of Gaza airport marks emotional day for Palestinians\n\n\n\t   DAHANIEH, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Thousands of Palestinians watched\nwith glee Tuesday as the first Palestine Airlines flight touched\ndown at their new Gaza International Airport _ a concrete sign for\nPalestinians that their homeland was one step closer to statehood.\n\t   As crew members waved the Palestinian flag from the pilot's\nwindow of the Fokker 50, the emotional crowd began a spontaneous\ncelebration of dance and song set to last for days.\n\t   ``The meaning of the airport is freedom and the feeling that you\nare a citizen in a country,'' Shaban Khalil, a 47-year-old man from\nGaza City, said jubilantly.\n\t   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat smiled broadly and flashed a\nvictory sign on the tarmac as he greeted each of the seven planes\nthat landed Tuesday. ``This is a preparation for the declaration of\nthe Palestinian state,'' he said.\n\t   Built with dlrs 75 million in contributions mainly from Japan,\nGaza International has one 2-mile-long (3.5-kilometer-long) runway\n_ long enough to accommodate all but the biggest jumbo jets.\n\t   The one passenger terminal for arrivals and departures resembles\nan Arabian desert palace with arches and multi-colored Moroccan\ntiles and includes a VIP lounge.\n\t   In the first weeks, airport operations will have to rely on some\nimprovisation. Major pieces of equipment, including those for the\ncontrol tower, are still at the Israeli port of Ashdod. Tuesday's\nplanes were guided in by a portable control panel installed in a\nvan.\n\t   Israel, which feared a solely Palestinian-run airport would mean\nenemies could land at its doorstep or smuggle weapons to the\nPalestinians, held up the opening for two years over security\nconcerns.\n\t   Under the airport agreement negotiated during last month's\nU.S.-sponsored Middle East summit in Maryland, Israel will continue\nto control the airspace and can shut down the airport at any time.\n\t   With a full-time but discreet monitoring presence there, Israel\nwill pre-approve all flight schedules and passenger lists, although\nno Israeli will sit in the control tower or operate any area of the\nairport.\n\t   On Tuesday, Israeli and Palestinian security agents greeted an\nEgypt Air flight and collected the passports of the passengers,\nincluding Egyptian Cabinet ministers.\n\t   As of Wednesday, Palestinian officials say no Israeli presence\nwill be visible. Arriving passengers will be transferred by buses\nfrom the planes to a security check area in the airport where they\nwill go through metal detectors. Palestinian agents will X-ray\nluggage and cargo while Israeli monitors observe the security\nchecks from behind one-way mirrors, as they do now at two other\ncrossings into autonomous Palestinian areas.\n\t   If Israel disputes an inspection, the passenger and his luggage\nwill be taken to a separate area where Israelis will carry out an\nadditional check while Palestinian agents observe.\n\t   Palestine Airlines, which already runs a twice-weekly flight to\nJordan from a small airstrip in Egypt, will now operate out of Gaza\nInternational. The brand-new national carrier is starting out with\na fleet of three planes, including a Boeing 727 _ a gift from a\nSaudi prince.\n\t   The airport will also be the permanent home of Arafat's\npresidential plane. A giant portrait of the Palestinian leader hung\nfrom the control tower for the festive opening Tuesday and Arafat\nwas on hand to personally greet the planeloads of dignitaries.\n\t   Next month, President Bill Clinton is expected to land there too\n_ giving implicit recognition for independence, at least in\nPalestinian eyes\n\t   Tuesday's opening was a dramatic event in the history of the\nPalestinian people. Despite the monitoring role, the airport marks\na significant loosening of the Jewish state's security grip over\nthe Palestinians.\n\t   Years of requests for Israeli permission, often denied, to\ntravel anywhere by land or air are slowly ending. For people in the\ncramped Gaza Strip, which is surrounded by barbed-wire on three\nsides and the sea on a fourth, the airport will provide th",
