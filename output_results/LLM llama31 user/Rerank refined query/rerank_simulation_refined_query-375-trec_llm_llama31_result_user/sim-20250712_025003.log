DEBUG:simuser.search.interfaces.pyterrier:raw text: QUEST TO TAME ENERGY OF STARS REVIVES  In its heyday it was a palace among physics laboratories, with an enviably fat budget, ample support staff and the prestige that comes to research institutions working at the cutting edge in solving global problems. But today, the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, still a leader in hydrogen fusion research, is so short of cash that it can no longer afford even a receptionist.    However, a dry spell of discouragements and spending cuts for fusion research may be ending. With their backs to a financial wall, specialists in the field are banding together to pursue the elusive goal of harnessing thermonuclear fusion, the process that drives the sun and hydrogen bombs.    Leaders in the field say the new spirit calls for lean, selective financing of small-scale experiments as well as the large ones that have dominated the field's history, increased cooperation between long-standing competitors, and a lot of patience.    Proponents of hydrogen fusion, the joining together of hydrogen nuclei to produce useful energy, have suffered too many frustrations over the years to hope for too much too soon. Fusion energy will not come tomorrow. But it could become a reality in the mid-21st century, believers say, and slow the carbon dioxide pollution of the atmosphere by the burning of fossil fuels _ a problem that may be leading to disastrous global warming.    Pressed by tight budgetary constraints imposed by Congress, competing fusion laboratories have begun sharing and coordinating their research to a greater extent than ever and have drafted guidelines for allocating their limited resources as they would an investment portfolio, giving major financing to the most promising projects but gambling some funds for high-risk but potentially fruitful experiments.    Next month fusion scientists and engineers from around the world will hold a meeting in Snowmass, Colo., to discuss all the devices and proposals currently on the table. It will be the first meeting of its kind, according to its co-chairman, Dr. Michael E. Mauel of Columbia University, and it signals a growing realization that if fusion energy is ever to become a reality it will require global cooperation rather than endless competition between nations and individual laboratories.    The main obstacle to accelerated research fusion, many scientists say, is the disincentive created by low fossil fuel prices.    ``Right now,'' said Dr. Robert J. Goldston, director of the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory in New Jersey, ``a bottle of table water costs more than a bottle of gasoline. But cheap oil won't last forever, and in any case, the burning of fossil fuels may be contributing to global warming. Fusion, which could produce enormous amounts of energy at reasonable cost with only negligible amounts of radioactive waste and no pollution of the atmosphere, may be our only practical alternative to fossil fuels.''    No one doubts that hydrogen fusion can be achieved. Huge pulses of fusion power have already been generated by experimental fusion reactors in the United States and Europe. The trouble is that until now, conventional generating plants have had to supply more energy to kindle a thermonuclear pulse than the pulse itself produces.    No one has yet been able to squeeze thermonuclear fuel tightly enough and long enough to ignite a self-sustaining fusion reaction.    In the sun, energy is produced when hydrogen nuclei fuse to produce helium, a heavier element. But for hydrogen nuclei to overcome their mutual electrostatic repulsion and get close enough to fuse, they must have very high velocities, that is to say, they must be very, very hot.    Scores of different reactor designs have been built, tested and abandoned over the years, most of which belong to one of two main categories: magnetic confinement, the squeezing of plasma by magnetic fields; and inertial confinement, the squeezing of hot gas by the implosion of miniature hydrogen bombs.

DEBUG:simuser.search.interfaces.pyterrier:raw text: FUSION-RESEARCH EFFORT DRAWS FIRE     A multibillion-dollar federal effort to create tiny blasts of pure fusion energy like that of a hydrogen bomb violates the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and shows that the United States is pursuing a double standard on the control of nuclear weapons, a new report says.    The study, published by an American scientific group, is the first to make that specific accusation but echoes growing criticism that the United States is heading down a dangerous nuclear road.    The nation, critics say, is at risk of becoming a nuclear hypocrite, talking eloquently of disarmament and the virtues of a comprehensive ban on nuclear testing while quietly investing billions of dollars in advanced technology that can perfect new kinds of weapons.    The new study is by the Institute for Energy and Environmental Research, of Takoma Park, Md., a respected scientific group founded in 1987 that has won praise from private experts for its critiques of the federal nuclear establishment. Its analyses have prevailed in lawsuits against the Energy Department, mostly involving contaminated nuclear-weapons plants, and led to out-of-court settlements.    In its new, 92-page report, to be issued Wednesday, the group warns that fusion research like that now under way by the government could be used to develop a new generation of hydrogen bombs and that it is thus illegal under the test ban. Some 150 countries, including the United States, are signers of the treaty.    The Energy Department, which runs the research program, strongly denies the institute's accusation. The department said Tuesday that its fusion research would produce no new weapons and instead was meant to help keep the nation's existing nuclear stockpile in good working order, as well as to help harness nuclear fusion for peaceful energy production.    Dr. Ray Kidder, a former nuclear-bomb designer at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, who reviewed the institute's report for technical accuracy, praised the group's work as rigorous and thorough, and said the issue of a possible treaty violation was important.    ``This question needs to be taken seriously and discussed in an open forum, and some decisions made about it,'' Kidder said in an interview Tuesday. He added that he and two colleagues had prepared a proposal for limiting pure-fusion research and that the proposal would appear in a coming issue of Physics Today, a professional journal.    One of his colleagues, Dr. Frank von Hipple, is a former adviser to the Clinton White House who now works at Princeton University. He has warned that pure-fusion research could result in devices ``compact enough to be used as weapons,'' a prospect taken increasingly seriously.    Dr. Hans Bethe, a Nobel laureate who was a main architect of the first atomic bomb, a half-century ago, wrote President Clinton last year to warn of the dangers of ``pure-fusion weapons.''    The institute's criticism focuses on a sprawling federal program that, in all, involves a dozen or so new major scientific projects at the nation's weapons laboratories and will cost roughly $4.5 billion a year for at least 10 years.    The ostensible aim of that program is to shift national efforts away from developing nuclear arms and toward maintaining stockpiles in good condition, using computer simulations and a battery of other advanced techniques to ensure the arsenal's potency.    But the institute says in its report that the fusion-research aspects of the colossal effort are so ambitious that they violate the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, long a holy grail of arms controllers. The Clinton administration promoted the treaty and signed it in 1996. Its aim is to end all nuclear blasts as a way to stop nuclear innovation, which customarily must be tested explosively.    Specifically, the institute criticizes a huge laser complex now under construction in Livermore, Calif., known as the National Ignition Facility. The $2.2 billion complex, about the size of the Rose Bowl, is to be completed in 2002, t

DEBUG:simuser.search.interfaces.pyterrier:raw text: 1999-04-11 10:53:30   usa   Princeton Researches Fusion Energy  Scientists using the country's newest experimental nuclear reactor believe they're gaining ground in  their efforts to develop a safe and inexhaustible power source for  the next century -- fusion energy.  The National Spherical Torus eXperiment, or NSTX, at the   Princeton University Plasma Physics Laboratory in this central New  Jersey suburb already is impressing both officials supporting  fusion research funding and the physicists and engineers working on  the nationwide collaboration.  ``The NSTX is an enormous example of the potential'' of the   technology, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said recently. ``It  brings us closer to the reality of fusion energy.''  Fusion, the process that powers the sun, involves slamming   special forms of tiny hydrogen atoms together at very high  temperature and pressure in a plasma, a hot mass of electrically  charged gas similar to the substance inside a fluorescent light  bulb.  Proponents say harnessing the power released when the atoms fuse   will one day provide a clean energy source far safer than today's  commercial nuclear fission reactors, which split apart large,  radioactive atoms. The fuel, hydrogen atoms removed from water, is  plentiful. In addition, the fusion process can't cause a  ``meltdown'' reaction and doesn't contribute to air pollution, acid  rain or the greenhouse effect.  Laboratory director Robert J. Goldston said the radioactivity   produced by a fusion reactor is 100,000 times less than in an  equivalent fission reactor.  Fossil fuel supplies are expected to run low in 50 years, and   many scientists hope fusion will be a major energy source before  then.  ``In the year 2100, either we're going to be real toasty and   under water (from flooding induced by global warming), or we're  going to have a completely different energy system,'' Goldston  said.  But perfecting the technology to control a self-sustaining   ``burn'' of nuclear fuel will take decades and cost hundreds of  millions of dollars. Meanwhile, physicists across the country say  progress has been slowed in recent years by the federal  government's inadequate financial commitment: just $27 million  annually for the NSTX project and $227 million a year for the  country's entire fusion research program.  ``Magnetic fusion research is eminently worthwhile because it   solves an energy problem,'' yet it's not a high priority for the  government, said Patrick Diamond, a University of California-San  Diego physics professor whose research focuses on turbulence in  reactor plasmas.  Limiting that turbulence, which quickly cools down the   multimillion-degree plasma and stops the fusion process, is one of  the biggest challenges to physicists and a major focus of the NSTX  team.  Diamond and his Princeton colleagues are particularly worried   that, under pressure from Congress, the administration has reduced  participation in a planned international collaboration on the next  generation of reactor to basically consulting with scientists in  Russia, Japan and a European consortium.  The only U.S. facility for the project was shut last year and   there is no funding for the collaboration in the proposed budget  for fiscal year 2000.  The physicists worry this country could end up paying for rights   to use the technology, rather than being able to sell it to  less-developed nations.

DEBUG:simuser.search.interfaces.pyterrier:raw text: 1999-04-11 09:14:26   usa   Princeton Researches Fusion Energy  Scientists using the country's newest experimental nuclear reactor believe they're gaining ground in  their efforts to develop a safe and inexhaustible power source for  the next century -- fusion energy.  The National Spherical Torus eXperiment, or NSTX, at the   Princeton University Plasma Physics Laboratory in this central New  Jersey suburb already is impressing both officials supporting  fusion research funding and the physicists and engineers working on  the nationwide collaboration.  ``The NSTX is an enormous example of the potential'' of the   technology, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said recently. ``It  brings us closer to the reality of fusion energy.''  Fusion, the process that powers the sun, involves slamming   special forms of tiny hydrogen atoms together at very high  temperature and pressure in a plasma, a hot mass of electrically  charged gas similar to the substance inside a fluorescent light  bulb.  Proponents say harnessing the power released when the atoms fuse   will one day provide a clean energy source far safer than today's  commercial nuclear fission reactors, which split apart large,  radioactive atoms. The fuel, hydrogen atoms removed from water, is  plentiful. In addition, the fusion process can't cause a  ``meltdown'' reaction and doesn't contribute to air pollution, acid  rain or the greenhouse effect.  Laboratory director Robert J. Goldston said the radioactivity   produced by a fusion reactor is 100,000 times less than in an  equivalent fission reactor.  Fossil fuel supplies are expected to run low in 50 years, and   many scientists hope fusion will be a major energy source before  then.  ``In the year 2100, either we're going to be real toasty and   under water (from flooding induced by global warming), or we're  going to have a completely different energy system,'' Goldston  said.  But perfecting the technology to control a self-sustaining   ``burn'' of nuclear fuel will take decades and cost hundreds of  millions of dollars. Meanwhile, physicists across the country say  progress has been slowed in recent years by the federal  government's inadequate financial commitment: just $27 million  annually for the NSTX project and $227 million a year for the  country's entire fusion research program.  ``Magnetic fusion research is eminently worthwhile because it   solves an energy problem,'' yet it's not a high priority for the  government, said Patrick Diamond, a University of California-San  Diego physics professor whose research focuses on turbulence in  reactor plasmas.  Limiting that turbulence, which quickly cools down the   multimillion-degree plasma and stops the fusion process, is one of  the biggest challenges to physicists and a major focus of the NSTX  team.  Diamond and his Princeton colleagues are particularly worried   that, under pressure from Congress, the administration has reduced  participation in a planned international collaboration on the next  generation of reactor to basically consulting with scientists in  Russia, Japan and a European consortium.  The only U.S. facility for the project was shut last year and   there is no funding for the collaboration in the proposed budget  for fiscal year 2000.  The physicists worry this country could end up paying for rights   to use the technology, rather than being able to sell it to  less-developed nations.  Given Washington's push for smaller, cheaper reactors, the   compact NSTX is particularly attractive, compared to the  gymnasium-sized fusion reactor it replaced here, Goldston said.

But a decision by collaborating scientists to rethink the design, as well as funding problems in the United States and Russia, have slowed the project.    Fusion occurs when very light atoms, usually hydrogen, fuse together after colliding at very high temperatures and pressure.

Stanley Pons and Martin Fleischmann are still true believers, as are other scientists and enthusiasts scattered around the globe who still see a glimmer of hope. Even the federal government keeps a few researchers investigating the topic, though inconspicuously.    Ten years ago today, on March 23, 1989, Pons, then chairman of the chemistry department at the University of Utah, and Fleischmann, a top British chemist at the University of Southampton, set the world of science on its head by announcing in Salt Lake City that they had achieved nuclear fusion at room temperature in a jar of water.    They claimed, in effect, to have tamed the sun, unleashing its might on earth without destructive side effects.    Hailed in headlines as the greatest discovery since fire, cold fusion was seen as promising to provide a safe, cheap and virtually inexhaustible form of power, ending human dependence on oil and redrawing the geopolitical map to make Salt Lake City the energy capital of the world.    Best of all, it was outrageously simple to do. The test apparatus cost a pittance and centered on palladium rods in a jar of heavy water, in which normal hydrogen is replaced by deuterium, an isotope of hydrogen that is ubiquitous in sea water.    The two said that an electric current passing through the test cell produced excess heat. Somehow, they said, atoms of deuterium were forced to fuse together, paving the way for a new age.    But the dream soon faded. Skeptics rushed forward. And after a few hectic months, cold fusion collapsed as most scientists were unable to match the startling results. Heavy blows were landed by such giants as the California Institute of Technology and a 22-member federal panel made up mainly of top university scientists, which said the reported find was too good to be true.    In particular, it found no credible evidence of bursts of neutrons, which the Utah team had claimed as key proof of nuclear alchemy.    Frank Close, a physicist with top positions at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee and the Rutherford Laboratory in Britain, went further. In ``Too Hot to Handle'' (Princeton, 1991), he charged that crucial evidence in the original claim was so skewed as to be ``invented,'' an allegation the two claimants denied.    Surprisingly, despite a decadelong cold bath of criticism, cold fusion is still alive today and apparently doing well in the scientific underground. Researchers around the globe quietly claim success at getting tantalizing results, if not blistering heats ready to topple the status quo. This hum of low-level work confounds skeptics and delights believers.    ``It's as alive as it's always been,'' Fleischmann, 72, said in a telephone interview from his home in Britain. Successful tests, he added, continue to show that whatever is happening has to be nuclear in nature.    ``It can't be chemical,'' he said. ``The energy quantities are too large, orders of magnitude larger.''    A Fellow of the Royal Society, the top honorary group for British scientists, Fleischmann painted a picture of conspiracy in which cold fusion was killed politically by a cabal of oil- and hot-fusion interests, among others.    Over the decades, scientists have spent billions of dollars to mimic the sun's hot-fusion reactions on earth. But that research has remained a scientific curiosity, and its practitioners were quick to question cold fusion, which in theory was a potential rival.    ``We've had incredible disinformation,'' Fleischmann said in the interview. He added that he himself was still exploring cold fusion experimentally, but would not say where or with what success.    The other half of the pair, Pons, 56, left the University of Utah in 1991 and now lives in France. Colleagues say he still backs the claims but is bitter over their public denunciation. ``He doesn't want to talk to the press,'' said Jean-Paul Biberian, a physicist at the University of Grenoble who is in contact with Pons.

If there is no oxygen in space, then how do the sun and other stars burn with apparent flames?    R.C. Jr., Goodyear, Ariz.    &QL;    A. As hot as the sun may be making you in Arizona, it's not really burning at all. It's fusing.    Burning is a chemical reaction that involves the electrons in the outer shells of atoms in the fuel. Oxygen is part of what's necessary for the chemical reaction. But the sun and other stars create their energy by fusing the nuclei at the center of hydrogen atoms. The single-proton nuclei from each of four hydrogen atoms fuse into a single nucleus of helium that has two protons and two neutrons. But the helium nucleus winds up with a smaller mass than the sum of those four hydrogen nuclei that fused together.    The difference is energy. Lots of energy.    Einstein's famous equation E(EQ)mc &UR; gfsu &LR; 2 translates to: energy equals mass times the speed of light squared. Well, the mass lost in fusing that tiny helium nucleus isn't very much at all. But the speed of light is 186,000 miles per second. Squared, that's 34,596,000,000. Multiply that times even the tiniest value for mass, and you've got lots of energy.    Fusion creates one million times more energy, per atom, than chemical burning. Who needs oxygen when you've got that kind of power available!    We can create the staggering power of the sun here on Earth, in the form of a hydrogen fusion bomb. But finding a way to use an on-going, self-sustaining nuclear fusion reaction for a controllable energy source has engineers stumped. Since temperatures reach five million degrees at the center of the sun, standard materials can't be used to build a container to hold such a reaction. Scientists have built machines called Tokamaks that use magnetic fields to do the job, but they haven't been able to hold the fuel long enough to reach ignition, the point at which the reaction becomes self-sustaining. That's what the sun does with fusion, and what nuclear power plants do with fission reactions, which split nuclei apart instead of fusing them together.    &QL;    (Readers are invited to send science questions to How&AMP;Why.

DEBUG:simuser.search.interfaces.pyterrier:raw text: TOP GOVERNMENT LASER EXPERT ADMITS LACK OF DOCTORATE AND QUITS    The director of an installation intended to house the world's most powerful lasers resigned his post on Friday after a flurry of anonymous faxes to officials at his California laboratory and the Department of Energy in Washington disclosed that he lacked a doctoral degree.    E. Michael Campbell, associate director for lasers at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in Livermore, Calif., left his position but remains an employee of the laboratory on leave, a laboratory spokesman said. Campbell is recognized as one of the world's leading experts in ultra-high-energy lasers.    Livermore's director, Dr. Bruce Tarter, said Campbell's resignation had been for strictly personal reasons.    The Livermore laboratory, operated by the Department of Energy, conducts research in nuclear weapons and nonmilitary projects, including the development of nuclear fusion as a source of power.    Campbell held a pivotal position at Livermore as director of a $1.2 billion program to build the National Ignition Facility, which will conduct research in weapons and fusion and play an important role in assuring that America's aging nuclear arsenal is ready for a war.    The main weapons research at the installation will focus on the Stockpile Stewardship and Management Program, which monitors the readiness of the nation's nuclear warheads, in part with mathematical models and laboratory experiments. Since the signing of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in 1993, the United States has barred test explosions of real nuclear weapons, and has sought to develop alternative methods of testing.    Campbell will be replaced by George Miller, Livermore's associate director for national security. Miller is expected to undertake a far-reaching evaluation of the status of the National Ignition Facility.    Jeff Richardson, a laboratory spokesman, said Monday that Campbell had falsely allowed the laboratory to believe he had a doctorate from Princeton University, but that Campbell's reasons for resigning had nothing to do with the installation.    ``In fact,'' Richardson said, ``Mike had completed his Ph.D. course work when he joined Livermore in 1977, but he never finished his dissertation.''    Asked whether a doctorate was required for holding Campbell's position, Richardson said, ``We require all senior managers to hold a doctorate or its equivalent in experience.''    He added that Livermore's former director, John Nuckolls, did not have a doctorate.    Livermore press releases during the last several years have always referred to Campbell as Dr. Campbell, and he apparently did nothing to correct the title.    Campbell could not be reached for comment either at his office or his home in Danville, Calif.    The author of many scientific papers, Campbell received the Department of Energy's 1985 Excellence in Weapons Research Award, the 1990 American Physical Society's Award for Excellence in Plasma Physics, and the 1994 E.O. Lawrence Award for his leadership in hydrogen fusion research. He is a fellow of the American Physical Society.    When completed in 2003 the National Ignition Facility will focus 192 laser beams on a tiny target, which will be instantly heated to the temperature of the sun's core. The targets, tiny hollow spheres of plastic filled with deuterium and tritium, are expected to explode in a flash of fusion energy that could one day be harnessed for electric power.    In essence, the tiny pellets are miniature hydrogen bombs, and their behavior is expected to simulate on a small scale the behavior of full-size thermonuclear weapons.

DEBUG:simuser.search.interfaces.pyterrier:raw text: SYSTEMS DESIGNED TO HOLD A HOMEMADE SUN     Scientists have developed a variety of devices and systems in which they hope to be able to compress hydrogen to the densities and temperatures needed to sustain thermonuclear fusion reactions. Among them are these: &QL;    TOKAMAKS    Tokamaks, reactors that are shaped like doughnuts and occupy large buildings, are chambers from which air has been removed and into which is injected a diffuse plasma of hydrogen isotopes, especially mixtures of deuterium and tritium. The plasma, a hot, electrically charged gas, is compressed within the doughnut by two sets of magnetic fields, one in which the magnetic field circles the doughnut the long way around and the other in which the magnetic field lines run the short way around the doughnut tube.    By varying the geometry and strength of the fields, they can be adjusted to produce a uniform compressive force on the plasma. But even with uniform compression, turbulence and instabilities develop in a tokamak's plasma, cooling it and enormously complicating the goal of achieving sustained fusion.    To ignite fusion, the compressed plasma in a tokamak must be raised to the temperature of the Sun, and various strategies have been developed for this. Part of the necessary heating is achieved simply by compressing the plasma. Another technique involves passing an electric current through the plasma, thus heating it in the same way electricity heats a toaster wire.    Heating can also be achieved by ducting microwave energy into the plasma, and another technique heats the plasma by shooting beams of neutral particles into it from an accelerator. Once fusion is initiated, helium ions (also called alpha particles) produced by the fusion of hydrogen nuclei transfer their energy to the plasma and help to heat it.    Dozens of tokamaks have been built and tested in many countries. Although the United States withdrew from a project called the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor _ a huge tokamak the planning for which has already consumed $1 billion _ Russia, Europe and Japan are continuing some work on the machine. But prospects for financing the project to completion seem bleak.    Meanwhile, the largest existing tokamaks continue to produce impressive fusion pulses. The Joint European Torus in England achieved a record for fusion power in a burst of 20 million watts. &QL;    SPHERICAL TORUS MACHINES    These are similar to tokamaks, in that they compress plasma fuel within toruses using interlocking magnetic fields. But they have much thinner cores than ordinary tokamaks, giving them a shape more similar to that of an apple than a doughnut. Their more or less spherical shape permits more efficient compression of plasma than can be achieved in a conventional tokamak.    A small spherical torus built and tested in Britain has already proved to have a very high ratio of plasma compression to magnetic field strength. Improving this ratio is a major goal of all magnetic confinement fusion devices.    The Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory has built a somewhat larger spherical torus reactor that is scheduled to begin an experimental program in August. Scientists believe that this type of reactor, with a tight magnetic field passing through its core, may be able to compress plasma and reach fusion conditions more cheaply than is possible with conventional tokamaks.    Princeton's National Spherical Torus Experiment will not achieve fusion, but it will allow operators to experiment with a wide variety of conditions. &QL;    STELLARATORS    Like tokamaks, these are more or less doughnut shaped, but their magnetic fields are designed to shape the compressed plasma into a warped helix with many kinks. Unlike a tokamak, a stellarator need not be perfectly symmetrical. Its configuration is believed to control plasma turbulence more efficiently than does a tokamak. Oak Ridge National Laboratory and the Princeton laboratory hope to get federal financing next year to build a small stellarator of advanced design. &QL

DEBUG:simuser.search.interfaces.pyterrier:raw text: ENGINEERING STUDIES    Some scientists and engineers have argued that fusion energy is inherently impractical because a fusion reactor costing billions of dollars would quickly wear out. The flood of very high-energy neutrons produced by hydrogen fusion penetrates metal and disrupts its crystalline structure, causing it to expand and become dangerously brittle. If the neutron bombardment were to reach the metal wall of a reactor's vacuum chamber, the entire chamber could eventually collapse, destroying the reactor.    Most of the latest reactor plans call for capturing the neutrons in a metal ``blanket'' (probably made of lithium) surrounding the hot plasma fuel. The neutrons would heat the blanket, and this heat would be transferred to a steam boiler to power a conventional turbine. The lithium blanket and some other internal components of the reactor would wear out in a few years, but could be periodically removed and replaced at relatively modest cost. The main part of the reactor would be spared. &QL;    INERTIAL CONFINEMENT    Besides compressing and igniting fusion fuel magnetically, the fusion reactions could also be ignited by an implosion as in hydrogen bombs.    In an inertial confinement reactor, the mixture of deuterium and tritium fuel is encapsulated as a thin frozen coating on the inside of tiny plastic hollow spheres. For each shot, a sphere is encased in a metal ``hohlraum,'' a chamber about the size of a pencil eraser placed at the focus point of 192 powerful lasers.    When the lasers hit the hohlraum, it emits a blast of X-rays that vaporize and compress the fuel sphere it encloses, imploding the sphere and raising the temperature of the fuel inside it to the ignition point, 100 million degrees Celsius or so. During the brief fusion reaction that ensues, the immense energy it produces is absorbed by a surrounding metal ``blanket,'' which transfers heat to a steam-powered electric generating plant.    This will be the basis of the $1.2 billion National Ignition Facility under construction at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California. Because experiments using the machine will help to monitor the combat readiness of America's arsenal of nuclear weapons, part of its financing comes from the Department of Energy weapons program. &QL;    Z PINCH    A variant of inertial confinement fusion called a ``Z pinch'' is under development at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, N.M.    This device would implode little thermonuclear fuel capsules like those the Livermore laboratory is developing, but without lasers. Instead, scientists have invented a cylindrical array of very fine tungsten wires and a gigantic capacitor, a device that can store and instantaneously discharge huge electric charges.    When the Sandia capacitor is fired, it sends a current of 20 million amperes through the fine wires in the Z pinch, and the wires are converted into super-hot plasma. The plasma is driven inward upon itself by the huge magnetic field produced by the sudden current.

FUEL CELLS MOVE SLOWLY BUT SURELY TOWARD BECOMING BIG BUSINESS  Jeff Colborn plunged into fusion energy research in the late 1980s, first at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and then at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, filled with idealism about fusion's potential for revolutionizing nuclear power generation.    ``I wanted the toughest challenge,'' said Colborn, recalling the goals he had after studying engineering and physics at the University of California at Berkeley.    But the entrepreneurial Colborn, who founded a business during high school selling decals for the motorcycles he and his friends raced, fretted that it could take 50 years before anyone could build a business on fusion. No wonder he is more at home these days as founder and chief executive of Metallic Power Inc., a little-known entrant in the intense race to design and manufacture fuel cells, low-pollution devices that generate electrical current from chemical reactions.    Although they are similar in many ways to batteries, fuel cells can be quickly regenerated by pumping in new chemical fuel. And unlike fusion, they are teetering on the edge of becoming big business. Several hundred units have been sold already, and some analysts predict a billion-dollar market by 2005.    The last steps are not coming easily, though. No one is making money yet, and the technology is not ready for potential home-run markets, like power for vehicles.    The fuel cell companies' slow path highlights the difficulties of innovating for the nuts-and-bolts dimension of the economy. Though this is not the fusion world it is also not the Internet world, where new services can be up and running within weeks and barriers to entry are low.    ``People have gotten used to the pace of change of information technology,'' said Vincent R. Shiely, a vice president who oversees new ventures _ including a research partnership with Metallic Power _ at Briggs &AMP; Stratton Corp., the largest manufacturer of nonautomotive gasoline engines. ``But this is pushing the frontier of materials, and there are still basic technology and reliability questions.''    Fuel cell companies are developing everything from replacements for tiny batteries like those used in cell phones and hearing aids to highly efficient power plants big enough to fit the needs of electric utility companies.    The challenge is to come up with answers to conflicting demands for, among other things, lightness, reliability, durability and low cost.    Metallic Power has been slowed down by annoyingly mundane problems like making its early designs leak-proof. But there have also been scarier roadblocks, as when Colborn and Stuart I. Smedley, his chief technology officer, reached the painful conclusion that a system they had adapted from other researchers for converting wastes back into recyclable fuel was hopelessly unreliable.    Smedley, a former university professor from New Zealand, eventually came up with a new design that was much simpler, one-tenth the size, and, perhaps best of all, something that Metallic Power's lawyer believes is patentable. But it took many months.    ``Multiplying the ideal time for each stage by two has turned out to be a pretty accurate predictor of what actually happens,'' Colborn said. ``Our schedule has stretched.''    Metallic Power was founded in 1995 but did not produce its first, primitive prototype until late 1997. The company faces steep challenges. Not only is it a relative newcomer with far less capital than many others; it is also using zinc as its fuel, a radically different approach.    Several venture capitalists unfamiliar with the energy business got cold feet after looking closely at Colborn's plans. Among them was a restaurant owner. ``I spent a lot of time driving to L.A. and eating in his restaurant,'' Colborn said, but the prospect dropped out when it came time to sign a check. ``Everybody thinks fuel cells are cool, but when they get into it they discover they know not

DEBUG:simuser.search.interfaces.pyterrier:raw text: MYSTERIOUS PROCESS BREAKS DOWN WATER MOLECULES    (FOR RELEASE THE WEEK OF MON., NOV. 16, 1998)    The words ``mysterious'' and ``bizarre'' don't often come up in conversations among chemists. But that's how they are describing a way to split water into hydrogen and oxygen at room temperature using a simple catalyst. Japanese researchers now say that the energy needed to break the bonds that hold water molecules together seems to come from stirring the liquid.    When Kazunari Domen and his colleagues at Tokyo Institute of Technology first reported last February that a powdered cuprous oxide catalyst could split water at room temperature, chemists sat up and took notice This reaction usually takes place at 3000 degrees C and is driven by light. If its efficiency could be improved, hydrogen would become much more attractive as a cheap, clean fuel.    Domen initially thought that the energy driving the low-temperature reaction came from light_a mechanism chemists could just about live with. But now he reports that the reaction continues in the dark for hundreds of hours. The quicker the container is stirred, says Domen, the more hydrogen and oxygen are produced.    Domen believes that the mechanical energy is converted to chemical energy without first being converted to thermal energy. ``This is the first example of mechanical energy being converted into chemical energy by catalysis,'' he says. But Domen cannot explain how this works.    To most chemists, the idea is heresy. And the prospect of producing a source of fuel by a mechanism no one understands evokes memories of the ``cold fusion'' saga of 1989. But Domen's results were carefully reviewed before they were published. He has also avoided making any bold claims about practical applications.    ``A lot of colleagues were incredulous, but I think Domen is a very serious scientist,'' says Michael Gratzel of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne.    Gratzel suspects that something more mundane is occurring, however, such as friction between the catalyst and the glass container causing a buildup of electrical charge. The resulting tiny sparks could break down small amounts of water. ``There's an easy way to rule that out,'' he says. Dissolving a salt in the water would change its conductivity and the amount of gases produced.    Arthur Nozik, a chemist at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden, Colorado, doubts if the effect is really caused by catalysis. ``I wouldn't be surprised if they are actually using up some of the metal oxide,'' he says. Nozik suspects that the cuprous oxide might react with water, liberating hydrogen. The oxygen could come from small quantities of the gas dissolved in the water.    Domen says that less than 5 percent of the energy from stirring appears to end up splitting water, producing a small amount of hydrogen and oxygen gas. But he thinks he can improve the yield by learning more about how the reaction works. ``If we can increase the efficiency by an order of magnitude, then it may be possible to think about practical applications,'' he says.    ``It sounds odd, but maybe it only sounds odd because it's new,'' says Sean McGrady of King's College, London. He likens the situation to the discovery in the 1980s that sound can drive chemical reactions, which has led to the burgeoning field of sonochemistry. ``When these things show up they always challenge people's conceptions of how energy can get into a chemical reaction,'' says McGrady. ``These reports take time to confirm or shoot down.''  &QL;    &UR; (This article is excerpted from New Scientist, a weekly science and technology magazine based in London.) &LR;  &QC;

Iyengar has said that the United States while pushing non-proliferation is spending billions of US dollars on more effective but smaller nuclear weapons. In an exclusive interview with the Observer of Business and Politics, which was published here today, Dr. Iyengar, who is India's former chairman of Atomic Energy Commission, said that the United States is spending as much as 3.8 billion US dollars a year under the stockpile stewardship program (SSP) to develop new nuclear weapons. If one looks deeper one finds that the new US program envisages progress in almost every field of activity towards more sophisticated weapons, he said. Quoting from the official publications of the US Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, which develops nuclear weapons, Dr. Iyengar said that the US is heavily investing in low power detonators that could form the core of new fusion devices (hydrogen bomb is a fusion device). It is also working on low energy implosion physics and high energy-density physics which together should help in creating devices like a super efficient neutron bomb that will have very little radioactive fall-out but could kill all life form.

The critical data collected from the five tests at Pokhran Range, the northwest desert state of Rajasthan, have enhanced India's capability to design new nuclear weapons through computer simulation, R. Chidambaram, chairman of the Indian Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), told a press conference here. Putting at rest Western speculation that India had tested a boosted fission device and not a hydrogen bomb, Chidambaram said they used a fission trigger and a secondary fusion device. A boosted fission device does not have a secondary stage. He said the yield of the hydrogen bomb, which could have been designed to be much higher, was deliberately kept low to avoid damage to the structures in a nearest village. He confirmed that fissile material used in all the five tests, code-named Shakti-98 Nuclear Mission, was completely indigenous and the tests were the culmination of a weaponization program started in the country years ago. The AEC chairman declined to disclose either the depths at which the five devices were placed or the nature of the fuel used, saying only that the devices were placed in five separate holes. According to Chidambaram, the yields of the three devices tested on May 11 were 45 kilotons for the thermonuclear device, 15 kilotons for the fission device and 0.2 kilotons for the low-yield device and those for the two low-yield devices tested on May 13 were 0.5 and 0.3 kilotons respectively. Replying to questions about whether India is going to induct nuclear weapons, scientific adviser to the defense minister P. J. Abdul Kalam said India is already a nuclear weapon state under Clause Nine of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. He declared that India's weaponization is complete and the command and control system, which is already existing in different forms, now requires consolidation. He said the recent tests have provided critical data for the validation of India's capability in the design of nuclear weapons of different yields for different applications and different delivery systems. These tests have significantly enhanced our capability in computer simulation of new designs and taken us to the stage of sub-critical experiments in the future if considered necessary, Kalam said. He told the crowed press conference that the high-energy explosive used in all the devices for compressing the core came from the explosive laboratory of the country's Defense Research and Development Organization.

DEBUG:simuser.search.interfaces.pyterrier:raw text: INVENTOR'S DEVICE MAY CUT AUTO EMISSIONS     It's no bigger than a beer mug, but the simple device developed in Daniel Cohn's lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has the potential to make significant reductions in the already drastically-improved emissions from ordinary cars.    Cohn, who has been working on the concept since 1993, last month won an innovation award from Discover magazine for the patented device, which cleans up emissions by producing pure hydrogen that is added to the engine's fuel mixture. This allows the engine to burn cooler and leaner (that is, with more air in the mix).    The device is quite simple: Fuel enters a chamber, mixes with air, and then is zapped with electricity. That creates a plasma _ an electrically-charged gas _ which then causes carbon from the fuel to join with oxygen from the air. This leaves a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen, both of which can be burned up by the engine.    ``It's well known that hydrogen improves the environmental qualities'' of a conventional engine, said Cohn, who is director of MIT's Plasma Science and Fusion center. The hard part has always been producing the hydrogen.    Although the first tests of the device connected to a conventional engine are just beginning at the US Department of Energy's Oak Ridge National Laboratory, calculations based on lab tests of the device by itself show that it should reduce nitrogen oxide emissions _ a major component of smog _ by 90 percent. ``A number of major car companies have talked to us,'' he said, ``both US and foreign.'' But he said it would not be appropriate to name the companies at this early stage of discussions.    ``The principle of what he's talking about is sound and attractive,'' said Daniel Sperling, director of the Center for Advanced Automotive Research at the University of California at Davis. But, he said, there are some unanswered questions, such as: how cheaply can it be manufactured, and what kind of maintenance issues might it encounter?    But an even bigger question, Sperling said, is how much need there is for such a device in the first place. Since new cars _ and especially the newer cars coming in the next few years _ are already vastly cleaner than their predecessors, ``the demand for a device of this kind is not nearly as great as 10 years ago.''    The progress _ which Sperling attributes in large part to strict regulations such as California's air-quality rules _ has been far greater than virtually anyone expected. ``The new cars, for all practical purposes, are zero-emitting,'' he said. ``It's extraordinary what they've done.''    Cohn agrees that the new cars are much cleaner, but points out that the major companies are still spending hundreds of millions of dollars in a quest for even cleaner cars. Also, some trucks and buses _ where much greater improvements are needed because their larger engines produce more emissions _ run on conventional spark-ignition engines, and thus could use the new device.    Besides offering cleaner emissions during ordinary operation, said Cohn, with his device the engine can be set to run on virtually pure hydrogen during startup _ the period when the greatest emission of pollutants usually occurs, because the car's catalytic converter has not yet warmed up to its operating temperature. Those startup emissions would be drastically reduced by such a system, he said. Already, Volvo has been working on a different technique for providing pure hydrogen to the engine during this startup period.    ``This device could greatly reduce air pollution from cars, trucks, and buses, using present internal combustion technology, without a major increase in costs and without any inconvenience to the driver,'' Cohn said.    But that's just one of the potential benefits of the device, Cohn said in an interview. Dubbed the ``microplasmatron,'' it could also allow a variety of unconventional or unrefined fuels _ including natural gas, diesel, and even ordinary vegetable oil _ to be used in car engines. That's because it is es

The Canadian Center for Fusion Magnetics confirmed Wednesday that the talks with Iran are entering into final stages. We're selling for 10 cents on a dollar or something like that,  said the center sources. The program has cost an estimated 250 million Canadian dollars (about 170 million U.S. dollars) after 15 years of research and development. The Canadian Center for Fusion Magnetics is a Montreal-based research agency in charge of the fusion program, which is funded by Ottawa's Atomic Energy of Canada Limited and by Hydro Quebec. The center was given a final lump sum of 19 million Canadian dollars (about 12.92 million U.S. dollars) in 1997 by Ottawa to wind up operations after Atomic Energy decided to just concentrate research on the Candu fission reactor. As part of the deal, several Canadian scientists would work with the Iranian government as consultants, the center sources said. The fusion reactor, called Takomak, is one of only 25 in the world. The deal, if struck, would mark the end of Canada's participation in the international quest for fusion, which many scientists see as the energy source of the future.

The device, known as an ASDEX unit, will be renovated and used in research work by the Southwest Physics Research Institute of the Nuclear Industry. Controlled nuclear fusion research is crucial to help develop and meet the energy demands of mankind in the future. People will be able to use the huge energy released from controlled nuclear fusion to generate electricity. China started controlled nuclear fusion research in the 1950s. It built the H1-1 tokamak in 1980s and has gained a series of physical parameters in recent years. The ASDEX device was jointly built by Germany and the European Community. German scientists conducted a series of experiments with the device, making it one of the renowned pieces of research equipment in the world. Germany agreed to transfer the device to China after building a larger device, realizing that China has already achieved fruitful results in fusion research. The device will promote China's controlled nuclear fusion research to a new stage, experts have predicted.

About 33 percent has been incinerated, but the clock is ticking. Aging artillery shells filled with lung-searing mustard gas and paralyzing sarin nerve gas have begun to leak. As a precaution, containers stored outdoors were recently moved into earthen ``igloos.'' These enclosures proved their worth in June, when three 155 mm artillery shells began leaking mustard gas. The gas did not escape.    Not all releases have been contained inside the plant, which is located about an hour's drive from Salt Lake City, site of the 2002 Winter Olympics. In May, a baby-aspirin quantity of sarin leaked from the incinerator after an emergency shutdown.    Although no one was injured, the airborne release proved embarrassing for Judge Tena Campbell. In April, she ruled against a lawsuit that sought to close down the plant. The suit was filed by environmentalists who feared an accidental incinerator release might occur.    The Tooele installation is the largest of eight poison gas bomb stockpiles in the United States.    GAS TANKS LIGHTEN UP    Buses that run on compressed natural gas would be more attractive if they would lose some weight. Empty, a typical 300-gallon fuel system for a bus tips the scales at about 3,400 pounds, according to French tank maker Ullit.    The company says that the same system using its newest plastic tanks weighs only 1,250 pounds. The interior of the tank is a thermoplastic liner, surrounded by a carbon-fiber and epoxy matrix.    Ullit says that 33-gallon tanks can be pressurized to 250 bars 100,000 times, without showing any sign of damage. Corrosion-proof, they always look new. The lightweight tanks will make their North American debut in Mexico City this year.    NEW FUSION REACTOR HEATS UP    Hopes for a practical fusion reactor have heated up following the startup of the National Spherical Torus Experiment, housed at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory in New Jersey.    NSTX is smaller and uses a lower magnetic field than earlier devices. ``The modest magnetic field allows simplified and flexible designs that ease upgrades,'' says a lab spokesman.    Ultrahigh temperatures inside fusion reactors cause lightweight isotopes of hydrogen to fuse into heavier helium, thus releasing massive quantities of energy. Unlike fission or atom-splitting reactors, fusion reactors create virtually no radioactive residue.    Hydrogen isotopes are also plentiful in seawater, and relatively easy to extract. If tests are successful, the lab will propose building an advanced spherical torus device that would be fueled with deuterium and tritium. It would be built in the space vacated by the lab's historic Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor, which is being dismantled.    GROW YOURSELF A NEW LIVER    Here's a breakthrough worth toasting. Doctors at New York University School of Medicine have grown liver tissue from bone marrow.    ``We're talking about a significant amount of functional liver tissue, up to 40 percent in one case,'' says Neil Theise, who led the research team.    The finding has broad implications for transplant surgery. Stem cells in marrow might be coaxed to grow into any organ. And donors don't reject their own tissue.    SAILING INTO THE COSMOS    NASA's first interstellar probe will borrow the technology that brought Christopher Columbus to the New World _ the sail.    Instead of catching the ocean breezes, the sail will capture sunlight by driving a spacecraft to our nearest neighbor, Alpha Centauri, which is 4.3 light-years away. ``Thin, reflective sails could be propelled through space just as the wind pushes sailboats,'' says a spokesman for the NASA Advanced Space Transportation program based at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala.    To catch enough energy for the trip, the sail will span about one-quarter of a mile. Carbon fiber is the top candidate for sail

Physicists have unveiled a reactor that uses a small laser to fuse atoms. While it won't solve the world's energy problems, it will make it possible to study fusion for a tiny fraction of the usual cost.    The fusion process is hard to start. Atomic nuclei repel each other, and it takes a lot of energy to force them to fuse. In the past, physicists have overcome this repulsion by using the energy of massive lasers costing hundreds of millions of dollars, or even more expensive options-uncontrolled nuclear fission or reactors using superhot gas confined within magnetic fields.    But researchers at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California have triggered fusion with a small laser costing less than $1 million. Each infrared laser pulse has less energy than a Christmas tree light emits in a second. But because the laser pulse lasts just 35 femtoseconds (35 times 10-15 seconds), its energy is highly concentrated.    Todd Ditmire and his colleagues injected deuterium gas into a vacuum, in which the atoms clustered together. Then they fired the laser at the deuterium clusters. When a laser pulse struck the clusters, the heat made them explode. Many of the deuterium nuclei hit others with enough speed to make them fuse, creating helium and neutrons.    ``We looked to see if we were producing fusion neutrons _ lo and behold, we were,'' Ditmire said. The fusion reaction also released energy, but only 10 millionths of the energy consumed by the laser. ``This is not, in the present guise, a path to fusion energy production,'' Ditmire admits. ``But it may potentially lead to a compact neutron source.''    A steady, cheap stream of neutrons could be slammed into materials to test their susceptibility to damage by energetic particles in space, for instance.

DEBUG:simuser.search.interfaces.pyterrier:raw text: NUCLEAR STOCKPILE GUARDIANS SQUABBLE OVER COST OF PROJECT     In an unusually public display of acrimony among the caretakers of the nation's nuclear stockpile, Sandia National Laboratories has charged that cost overruns on a giant laser at another federal laboratory may disrupt the program that ensures that the stockpile remains safe and reliable.    The laser, the National Ignition Facility, is designed to mimic some conditions at the heart of an exploding hydrogen bomb. But its expected construction costs at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory have doubled to $2.1 billion, and critics in Congress have begun to wonder aloud if the project is worthwhile.    Since 1992, when the United States abandoned nuclear tests, the national laboratories have vied to devise ways to simulate nuclear explosions in hopes that these methods will allow them to determine whether stockpiled warheads are still usable.    Officials at the Energy Department, which runs both Sandia in Albuquerque and Lawrence Livermore in Livermore, Calif., publicly rebuked Sandia, saying its criticism was inaccurate and, in any event, should not have been made in public.    Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said the Sandia criticism was ``totally out of line and inconsistent with the nation's stockpile stewardship policies.''    Richardson said the cost overruns would be handled with money from defense programs, and largely within Livermore's existing budget.    ``The labs are very competitive with each other, and this outburst is typical lab belly-aching that is sometimes aimed at jockeying for appropriations at the expense of each other,'' Richardson said. ``While we have contained the rivalries in the past, it seems that NIF is too big a pot to ignore.''    Under pressure, Sandia tempered its stance late Thursday, issuing a more conciliatory statement on the project.    But opponents of the laser seized on the original statement to advance their argument that the project was unworkable. ``The objections have been echoing around the weapons complex for the last couple of years,'' said Christopher Paine, a senior researcher at the Natural Resources Defense Council. ``They're now being publicly stated.''    The National Ignition Facility would consist of 192 individual laser beams converging on a tiny pellet of nuclear fuel to generate fusion energy _ a vastly scaled-down version of one element of a hydrogen bomb.    The laser, like other parts of the stockpile stewardship program at Sandia, Livermore and Los Alamos National Laboratory, would allow scientists to approach the harsh conditions in bombs for study. But the project, which has been under construction since 1997, has encountered a series of problems, including the resignation of its director, construction delays and ballooning costs.    Those problems led to the critical statement on Tuesday from Tom Hunter, a senior vice president for defense programs at Sandia.    Delays and overruns at the laser project ``will disrupt the investment needed to be made at the other laboratories,'' Hunter said. ``This causes us to question what is a reasonable additional investment in the NIF.''    Even though Sandia had contacted reporters with those criticisms, the statement Thursday called their release inadvertent. Hunter is quoted in the release as saying that ``public divisiveness is not helpful in finding good solutions,'' but he did not directly contradict the criticisms.    Rod Geer, a Sandia spokesman, said that ``the concern still exists'' on how the various parts of the stockpile stewardship program will fit together financially.    Clay Sell, a staff member on the Senate Appropriations Committee, said that the cost overruns were placing the project in jeopardy. ``Absolutely, it's in danger as a program,'' Sell said.    Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, who is a member of the committee, said, ``the project's costs appear to be rising sky-high,'' adding that ``Congress needs to take more decisive action to prevent further money down the drain.''

Hydrogen is the most abundant element on the planet and its combustion does not contaminate the atmosphere since it only produces steam, Dr. Vito Quevedo, the chief of the National Program for the Development of Sustainable Energy Sources, said today. The group for studying hydrogen as a renewable energy source will collate all the work being done in the country to speed up research, he added. During the first stage of research, the group will seek all the information available worldwide on the practical uses of hydrogen. The experts will continue to investigate the use of solar energy to produce cheap electricity in order to obtain hydrogen through the decomposition of water.

DEBUG:simuser.search.interfaces.pyterrier:raw text: POWERFUL LASER CREATES MINIATURE COSMOS BLASTS  It doesn't matter whether you're talking about a star, which can be about a million miles across, or a galaxy, or a speck of plastic no bigger than a grain of dust. Blasted with enough power, they all blow up pretty much the same way.    That's the concept behind a series of experiments being carried out at the world's most powerful laser facility, located at the Laboratory for Laser Energetics at the University of Rochester. By zapping tiny samples with a powerful laser beam, scientists here can reproduce the unimaginable violence of stellar-scale collisions and explosions, events that cannot be studied directly in any other way.    Out of these microscale laser bursts, astronomers hope to learn about everything from planets and exploding stars to star-gobbling black holes.    ``It's a sea-change in the way we do astrophysics,'' Says University of Rochester astronomer Adam Frank, an enthusiastic proselytizer for the new technology. ``Now, for the first time, we have a chance to bring stellar conditions down to Earth.''    The amazing power of a blast from the Rochester laser, called Omega, only lasts for a billionth of a second, but, during that ultra-brief flash, its power is almost 100 times greater than the total energy consumption of the United States. That stunning power makes it the only facility on Earth that can realistically simulate the effects of anything from the relatively puny blast of a nuclear bomb to the explosion of a star _ an event so violent that it briefly puts out as much energy as the light of hundreds of billions of stars.    That means scientists can now observe in the lab violent interactions that before could only be observed from thousands of light years away, unfolding seemingly in slow motion over a period of many years _ and in some cases, millions of years. The only other choice, until now, has been simulations in the most powerful supercomputers.    ``We can recreate the conditions of radiative blast waves in space,'' said Frank, referring to the energy and debris hurtling outward from cosmic explosions and slamming into interstellar gas. ``This has never been possible in the lab before.''    The field is so new, even most astronomers and astrophysicists are not yet familiar with its potential. Bruce Remington of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in Livermore, California, a physicist and one of the pioneers of the new research, said that at a recent international meeting of astrophysicists, ``people would stare at us'' as if to say `` `what are you doing here?' '' They were initially skeptical when he discussed his research, but, by the meeting's end, he said, they recognized the new method's potential.    But laser simulations of space have already demonstrated the power to reveal important information that cannot be garnered any other way. For example, during the nearest stellar explosion ever observed by astronomers, called supernova 1987A, matter from the dying star's center reached its outer edges more than twice as fast as theories had predicted. Now, laser experiments have enabled scientists to study new calculations of how the process may really work.    ``It's a debate that we're still in the middle of,'' Remington said, but the laser experiments allow scientists to reproduce the conditions and seem to confirm that there was ``a fundamental flaw in how people think a star explodes.''    Closer to home, it turns out that astronomers' theoretical understanding of the gases inside of the giant planets Jupiter and Saturn was also off-base. Equations describing how hydrogen gas behaves when it is squeezed under the colossal pressures of Jupiter's interior were wrong, neglecting a kind of atomic ``softening'' under pressure that allows it to be compressed more densely than astronomers had thought.    Laser simulations in Rochester revealed the unusual behavior of pressurized hydrogen, suggesting that Jupit_ter and Saturn contain layers in whic

The breakthrough will make it possible for mankind to harness a safe, clean and endless source of energy. JET broke the world record for power fusion on September 22, by using the deuterium-tritium fuel mixture. The power output peaked at 12.9 megawatts and remained above 10 megawatts for half a second, announced JET Director Dr Martin Keilhacker at a press conference in London. It also broke the world record for the ratio of fusion power produced to the net input power with 0.6 in the same experiment, he added. If the ratio is above 1, the fusion will not only be maintained by the energy it releases, but also output net energy. In a previous experiment, JET created a new energy fusion world record of 14 megajoules in three seconds with an average output power above 4 megawatts. In November 1991, for the first time, controlled fusion power was produced by JET with output power peaking at 1.7 megawatts. Since then, the US Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor has produced 10.7 megawatts of fusion power at a ratio of 0.28.

DEBUG:simuser.search.interfaces.pyterrier:raw text: SCIENTIST FINDS BLURRY LINE BETWEEN FRIENDLY TALK AND SECURITY BREACH  At first, the questions from his Chinese hosts seemed harmless enough to George Keyworth, a nuclear scientist.    It was 1980, and Keyworth, the chief physicist at Los Alamos National Laboratory, was in China to lecture at a research center, happy to engage in some simple academic give and take. He knew the audience was filled with Chinese nuclear weapons experts eager for insights into American weapons designs, but he figured he could handle whatever questions they threw at him.    Keyworth had traveled to China to lecture on his research into fusion energy _ not about nuclear weapons. He was determined to stick to his topic, and not wander into loose talk about secret information. But a congressional committee, as it investigated leaks of nuclear secrets to China, has charged that the episode, while inadvertent, bordered on a negligent breach of security by a senior scientist.    In China, Keyworth found himself being peppered with increasingly detailed inquiries that related directly to nuclear weapons. Benign inquiries about fusion and astrophysics soon gave way to pointed requests for information about such highly classified matters as the ignition conditions of the hydrogen isotopes deuterium and tritium _ and about the then-new neutron bomb.    Keyworth now says he fended off the demands for specifics, but he did respond in one instance by offering an analogy. Deuterium and tritium ignite at such low temperature levels, he told the audience, that you could just about get ignition by dropping them on the floor.    Keyworth came home believing he had avoided the traps laid out for him by the Chinese, and had not betrayed any American secrets. Yet he was concerned enough to report the incident to Los Alamos and to intelligence officials. ``When I came back, I used this example many times to show how completely benign conversations could turn into uncomfortable situations in China,'' Keyworth said in an interview.    Within a year, Keyworth moved on to the high-profile post as science adviser to President Reagan.    But 19 years later, the episode was resurrected by a House select committee that investigated China's nuclear thefts and illicit technology transfers. In its May report, the committee mentioned it _ without identifying Keyworth _ as a cautionary example of the security risks that American scientists confront in dealing with China.    In many ways, the Keyworth case underscores how international exchanges often lead government scientists into gray areas, where the line between vigorous scientific debate and the compromise of national security information can be blurred. Scientists from government weapons labs involved in exchanges in China and other countries need useful and creative discussions with fellow scientists, but must constantly remember the difference between stretching the rigid bounds of classification and breaking them.    And it also shows how scientists view their own foreign scientific exchanges differently than do counterintelligence watchdogs.    In the congressional report, from the select committee chaired by Rep. Chris Cox, R-Calif., a scientist is depicted as having crossed an obscure line. The report states that ``the incident involved the inadvertent, bordering on negligent, disclosure of classified technical information by a U.S. scientist lecturing'' in China. The report adds that the scientist ``was pressured'' by counterparts there ``to provide a solution to a nuclear weapons-related problem.''    ``Rather than decline,'' the report says, ``the scientist, who was aware of the clear distinction between the classified and unclassified technical information that was under discussion, provided an analogy.''    American officials at several government agencies confirmed that the reference in the Cox report is to the Keyworth episode.    Keyworth says he is outraged that the episode has been resurrected in the Cox report in a way that he says is distorted. He says tha

DEBUG:simuser.search.interfaces.pyterrier:raw text: SUPER LASER MAY YIELD `BIG SCIENCE'  Despite hefty cost overruns, the embarrassing resignation of a top official and headline-making project overhauls, the world's biggest laser is still under construction at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.    Exploding stars and other astronomical spectaculars might be simulated on the super-laser, known as the National Ignition Facility or NIF, officials and scientists said on the opening day of a conference Monday.    Due for completion in 2003, NIF ``is really big science'' and might generate ``some pleasant scientific surprises,'' Steve Koonin, the provost at the California Institute of Technology, said in the keynote speech at the conference.    ``It's hard to say what they will be; if I did, they wouldn't be surprises.''    Turbulence is one phenomenon that might be better understood using the $1.2-billion-plus laser, scientists say.    They want to understand turbulence so they can figure out how to simulate nuclear weapons blasts and generate fusion energy on Earth. Scientists see fusion energy, the same energy that powers the sun, as being used to power 21st-century electrical grids.    For decades they have tried to use lasers to rapidly compress nuclear fuel pellets to such high densities that their atomic nuclei fuse, releasing nuclear energy. But so far, thanks to turbulence, such laser-propelled compressions have been messy because the laser unevenly heats the pellets' surfaces.    If NIF works as planned, though, it will have applications to pure science as well as nuclear weapons and commercial energy.    For example, it could generate extremely high temperatures and pressures that enable astrophysicists to simulate processes deep within stars or planets.    Such scientific rationales for NIF are, politically speaking, increasingly valued nowadays as project planners reel from two recent revelations:    _ The price tag for NIF may run $350 million higher than originally projected, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson admitted last month.    He announced plans to overhaul the program and also said he would withhold $2 million of a ``good performance'' fee to the University of California, which runs Livermore under contract with the Energy Department.    E. Michael Campbell, associate director of lasers at Livermore, resigned from the post in late August after acknowledging that he never completed the dissertation for his doctoral degree in electrical engineering at Princeton University.    _ The future of NIF has been clouded by the recent controversy over suspected spying in programs unrelated to NIF at Livermore's sister lab, Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. Earlier this year, congressional investigators charged that China had stolen U.S. data for its nuclear weapons program; the FBI has investigated an American scientist of Chinese descent, but has not formally charged him with any crime.    As a result, the U.S. Department of Energy, which contracts with the University of California to run both the Livermore and Los Alamos labs, has tightened lab security requirements. Some personnel at the labs have privately said the spy investigation is racially motivated because it focused on a Chinese-American scientist, and complain that the tightened security will make it harder to attract top researchers to the labs.    Officials at the conference declined to talk about the controversies in detail. But during a question-and-answer period following his address to the conference, one Energy Department official discussed the possible impact of tightened security on scientists using NIF.    New security measures will make scientists' efforts to use NIF for scientific research harder, said Ron McKnight of the Energy Department's Office of Fusion Energy Science. ``There will be more gateways to walk through, there will be more bridges to cross.''    Because NIF has both military and pure-science uses, ``I think it will take an aggressive effort on our part to make sure the coordination (with defense

Researchers with the Harbin Architecture Institute in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province said they can now produce 280 cubic meters of hydrogen gas that is 99 percent pure from a 50-cubic- meter container of sewage each day. This means China can now produce hydrogen on an industrial scale, said Prof. Ren Nanqi, who heads the research group. According to Ren and other experts, researchers in other countries have taken a different road for hydrogen production with biological technology, and no major breakthrough has been reported in their experiments. Compared to the traditional electrolytic process or production of hydrogen from petroleum and other minerals, the new method saves energy and uses no minerals, which cannot be reproduced, Ren said. What's more, he said, their method can purify sewage into clear water in the process of producing hydrogen. Li Guibai, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, confirmed that the technology developed by Ren and his colleagues is leading the world in this field of research and may lead to the discovery of a clean and reproducible energy resource for mankind.

The discovery, made by Professor Kazunari Domen and colleagues at Tokyo Institute of Technology, seems a kind of heresy to most chemists, the New Scientist magazine said Saturday. However, their results were carefully reviewed by other chemists before they were published in Chemical Communications, a learned journal of the British Royal Society of Chemistry. The researchers have found that when they put a powdered cuprous oxide catalyst into a beaker of water at room temperature, and stirred it energetically, hydrogen and oxygen were given off. Professor Domen initially thought that the energy driving the low-temperature reaction came from light, a mechanism chemists could just about live with. But later he found that the reaction continues in the dark for hundreds of hours, suggesting that it was the stirring, not any energy from light, which helping the process. The quicker the container is stirred, the more hydrogen and oxygen are produced, Professor Domen reported. The researchers believed that the mechanical energy is converted to chemical energy without first being converted to thermal energy. This is the first example of mechanical energy being converted into chemical energy by catalysis, Professor Domen said. The researchers admitted that they don't know how it works, saying that less than five per cent of the energy from stirring appears to end up splitting water, producing a small amount of hydrogen and oxygen gas. But Professor Domen thought that he can improve the yield by learning more about how the reaction works. If we can increase the efficiency by an order of magnitude, then it may be possible to think about practical applications, he said.

DEBUG:simuser.search.interfaces.pyterrier:raw text: PROJECT TO IGNITE TINY THERMONUCLEAR EXPLOSIONS IS $1 BILLION OVER BUDGET     The big laser, which would be the most powerful ever built, had won congressional approval despite a construction cost of $1.2 billion and another $1 billion for research and development.    The key to this remarkable success, the physicist said, could be found in its threefold attraction to science and society. When the project was completed in 2004, its 192 laser beams would converge on a tiny fuel pellet, crushing and heating it until fusion reactions among its atoms began spewing out nuclear energy.    Those experiments would allow bomb makers to study the physics of nuclear weapons without exploding them, helping to assure the reliability of the nation's nuclear stockpile. They would also let engineers explore the possibility of commercial power plants based on this type of ``laser fusion,'' and they would offer scientists the chance to probe matter under conditions never before created in a laboratory.    After using those advantages to help score a victory for the project, called the National Ignition Facility, or NIF, the scientist directing the project told the conference, ``I see how hard it is to get a billion dollars.''    Participants listened with a mixture of envy and admiration to the man they knew as Campbell. Many were deeply dispirited by recent revelations of sky-high costs, technical questions and an overoptimistic sales message that would soon bring congressional wrath, and its budget ax, down on another titanic fusion project, this one based on powerful magnetic fields and called the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor.    Now, after a series of plot twists, the fabulous laser could face a similar fate. Events since that conference have damaged Livermore's credibility, derailed scientists' careers and perhaps threatened the nation's ability to safeguard its nuclear stockpile. Campbell even turned out not to have the Princeton Ph.D. that his peers assumed he had.    But in an ominous echo of his words in Madison, NIF will cost at least $1 billion more than originally expected. If the project survives, it may have reached its nadir on Sept. 7, when project officials were denounced on the floor of the Senate.    As negotiations between the House and Senate for the fiscal 2001 budget conclude, lawmakers must now decide whether to move about $100 million to NIF from other activities that safeguard the stockpile. The reallocation, which has been requested by the Energy Department, would more than double the Clinton administration's original request for the project and save it for the time being.    Saying that its scientists simply underestimated the complexity of building the laser, laboratory officials dismiss all accusations that technical problems were intentionally covered up. Still, the plunge in the project's political stock has been breathtaking.    ``It looked as if they had all the answers, and they were moving on the project,'' said Dr. Dale M. Meade, head of advanced fusion concepts at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, who attended the Madison meeting and who specializes in the sort of fusion that the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor might have produced. ``And since that time, the roof has fallen in on them.''    Even so, Dr. George H. Miller, a former nuclear weapons designer, who is now associate director for NIF programs at Livermore, argues that the laser is the only vehicle for scientists to study the high temperatures and densities of matter that occur in an exploding nuclear weapon _ except, of course, in actual nuclear tests, which the nation has not conducted since declaring a moratorium on them in 1992.    ``NIF is one of the major experimental facilities that we were lacking when we ended nuclear testing,'' Miller said. The purpose of the laser, he said, is to ``allow us to maintain our nuclear deterrent, and to maintain it in a condition that is safe and reliable _ but do it without nuclear testing.''

Experts say that this valuable isotope of helium might become the source of nuclear energy in the 21st century. The geologists said they identified three factors that influence the concentration of the gas. The first is the age of rock: helium-3 should be concentrated in old soils, since they have been exposed to the solar wind for much longer. The second factor is the type of rock: titanium-containing minerals, principally ilmenite, are particularly effective at trapping helium-3. The last factor is the strength of the solar wind: places where it is strongest will accumulate more helium-3. Based on the above three factors, the geologists have deduced that the best places possible to find helium-3 are the Mare Tranquillitatis and the Oceanus Procellarum on the near side of Moon, and the Tsiolkovskiy crater and the Mare Orientale on the far side. According to their estimates, there is about a million tons of helium-3 on the Moon as a whole, compared with an estimated 20 tons in the Earth's deep interior. Researchers say a nuclear fusion reactor exploiting the fusion of helium-3 and deuterium would generate very few neutrons. This has the great advantage of not making the containment vessel radioactive, as happens in a conventional tritium-deuterium fusion reactor.

DEBUG:simuser.search.interfaces.pyterrier:raw text: `JUST SIX NUMBERS': GETTING DOWN TO EARTH WITH THE ASTRONOMICAL     Famous cosmology books that offer to explain the universe to the astronomically inept like myself have always ended up disappointing me. Stephen Hawking's ``Brief History of Time'' may have been the least understood best seller of all time. Steven Weinberg's ``First Three Minutes'' didn't sell as well as Hawking's book, but it competed with it in the difficult-to-wrap-your-mind-around sweepstakes. In light of that, I opened Martin Rees' ``Just Six Numbers: The Deep Forces That Shape the Universe,'' another astronomical overview for laymen, with some trepidation.    I needn't have. Rees' book is not easy; portions of it are even quite elusive. Still, it manages to be both a deep and an accessible book, and it answers a lot of the questions produced by natural wonderment.    The main idea of ``Just Six Numbers'' is that the universe is amazingly fine-tuned, and that if certain basic features were mathematically just a little bit different, we wouldn't be here, and neither would much else in the present universe. The force that holds the atomic nucleus together _ Rees' epsilon _ is one example, since, if it were just a bit larger or just a bit smaller, there would be no stars. Or, if the force of gravity were only slightly different, the universe would never have come into existence. Rees, an English cosmologist who holds the title of astronomer royal at Cambridge University, explains why these various numbers account for the universe as it formed over the last 10 to 12 billion years _ and he gives us some sense of what will happen to it in the future (a prediction based on another of his six numbers).    Most compelling, Rees also shows the deep and powerful connections between ourselves and everything else, the way our existence and the nature of the universe are part of one consistent picture. Perhaps it is obvious to some that if the Andromeda Galaxy weren't there, neither would we be, but to me that revelation brought a mystical, almost spiritual frisson. We are, Rees tells us, quite literally made of stardust. ``We cannot understand our origins without the cosmic context,'' he writes at the beginning of his cosmological-mathematical-philosophical rumination. If you apply yourself at something more than a casual level to his nontechnical, layman-friendly prose, you can pretty much understand what he means even when the concepts get, as it were, pretty stratospheric.    Rees answers basic questions like this: Why could we exist only in a very big universe? If the universe weren't something on the order of 10 billion light years across, life on earth would be impossible. This is because it took some 4.5 billion years for human life to develop here on earth from the original single cell organisms, and it took just as long for the earliest stars to have produced the materials that make up our life.    ``The very hugeness of our universe, which seems at first to signify how unimportant we are in the cosmic scheme, is actually entailed by our existence!'' Rees exclaims. ``The expanse of space is not an extravagant superfluity; it's a consequence of the prolonged chain of events, extending back before our solar system formed, that preceded our arrival on the scene.''    Rees then gives a capsule history of cosmic formation, showing how the original element, hydrogen, transmuted into all of the others, up to the biggest, most complex naturally occurring one, uranium. ``Supernovae have created the `mix' of atoms that the earth is made of and that are the building blocks for the intricate chemistry of life,'' Rees writes. When they exploded, they showered the universe with the debris that, eons later, ended up in the gaseous swirl that, eons after that, formed the sun and the planets of our solar system. This cosmic history explains why there is a great deal of carbon and iron in the world but very little gold. It is because the elements in their natural state exist in the same proportions as they were created during the eventful life cycles of

DEBUG:simuser.search.interfaces.pyterrier:raw text: Researchers find new evidence of water on the moon As much as 10 billion metric tons of water may be frozen in soil near the moon's poles, according to new data from a spacecraft orbiting the moon.    If that much water is there _ more than 10 times previous estimates _ it might one day be enough to build a moon village or to fuel rocket ships cruising even deeper into space, experts say.    ``Our data is very clear _ there is an abundance of hydrogen at both lunar poles, and we interpret that to mean there is water there,'' said Alan Binder, chief scientist for the Lunar Prospector spacecraft now orbiting the moon. ``There is at least one billion tons of water, but there could be as much as 10 billion tons.''    That, said Binder, is enough to build a colony on the moon's surface and to operate a rocket service station for journeys beyond.    ``We knew from the Apollo missions that we could go to the moon and build a base there, but we would have to take our water and fuel with us,'' Binder said.    The deposits of water or hydrogen, he said, are ``an enabling resource. You could build a colony without it, but this really makes it a lot simpler.''    In addition to sustaining life in such a colony, water also can be used for rocket fuel by breaking it into its constituent chemicals _ hydrogen and oxygen. Propellant for the main engines on the space shuttle, for instance, is hydrogen and oxygen.    Paul Spudis, a researcher at the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston, called the discovery significant.    ``We've debated for 30 years whether or not there is ice on the moon, and now this shows there is,'' Spudis said.    Spudis was on the science team of an earlier lunar mission _ the Clementine spacecraft _ that found radar indications of water on the lunar south pole. Now, he said, two different research methods have confirmed the presence of lunar water.    ``This makes colonizing the moon a lot more attractive,'' said Ed Weiler, a space scientist at NASA. ``I think before we colonize to Mars we need to colonize the moon for practice, so from that perspective this is a major discovery.''    Binder, head of the U.S. Lunar Research Institute, and researchers from the Los Alamos National Laboratory, both in California, report their findings from the Lunar Prospector spacecraft Friday in the U.S. journal Science.    Lunar Prospector was launched in January and has spent months orbiting the moon, gathering signals with four instruments.    The craft found water or hydrogen deposits with a device that measures the energy, or speed, of neutrons. Neutrons form when radiation from the sun strikes the moon's surface. They bounce around in the soil, then out into space. The energy or speed of the neutrons is affected by the chemistry of the soil.    By measuring the ratio of intermediate-speed neutrons to the fast and slow neutrons, the researchers were able to determine that hydrogen is present in the lunar soil, Binder said.    Ice is signaled at both poles, but about 50 percent more appears to be around the north pole, the researchers said.    Binder and other researchers said the most logical form for that hydrogen to take is as a constituent of water. And since the moon is so cold, the water is certain to be frozen solid.    All the deposits are in patches within craters that never see sunlight. Temperatures there are constantly about minus-250 degrees F (minus-156C), said Binder. This keeps the ice in place ``virtually forever,'' he said. The data suggest the ice is in layers, covered with up to 18 inches of soil.    Even more ice could be in layers below two feet of soil, said Binder.    Harvesting the ice would involve digging it up and thawing it, using solar reflectors. A chemical process then could separate hydrogen and oxygen.    ``The only trick would be to build equipment that could work in those extremely cold temperatures,'' said Binder.    Comets smashing into the moon over millions of years probably deposited the water, Binder and Spudis said.    An impacting c

Scientists are fine-tuning an invention that may eventually replace not only those fallible batteries but even the recharger.    The invention is the fuel cell, a device that may one day sit neatly inside your mobile phone or laptop. It uses the reaction of hydrogen and oxygen to generate a continuous stream of electricity for days on end with no help whatsoever from a battery.    Fuel cells were once seen as future power sources for cars, buses and power stations, but inventors are now proposing them for the subkilowatt world of portable electronics. They may soon come to the aid of soldiers, police officers and even everyday commuters who are weary of the inconvenience of their battery packs, rechargers and spare AAs.    Some experts say the latest fuel cells may provide a power source that weighs far less, and lasts far longer, than any battery on the market, in part because of their efficient use of hydrogen.    ``Fuel cells have a simply amazing ability to extract energy from the hydrogen atom,'' said Dr. Christopher Dyer, a senior member of the technical staff at Motorola Labs in Tempe, Ariz., who is the inventor of a fuel cell designed for use in portable electronic devices.    The principle of every hydrogen-based fuel cell is that when hydrogen is joined to oxygen, forming water, energy is produced. The energy takes the form of electricity and some waste heat. The byproducts, depending on the source of the hydrogen, are a bit of water vapor and, often, carbon dioxide, which is vented from the fuel cell.    Give the fuel cells enough hydrogen, plus the oxygen that is provided free in the atmosphere, Dyer said, and they could power devices like cell phones for days, weeks or even months. The hydrogen that drives these small marvels will probably be provided by methanol, a compound commonly known as wood alcohol that contains hydrogen, Dyer said.    ``A liter of methanol should provide enough electricity to run a laptop for more than a week,'' Dyer said. ``A lithium ion battery of comparable volume has a tenth of that energy.'' Lithium ion batteries, commonly used in laptops, each provide about three hours of energy.    Fuel cells have another advantage besides a high energy output, Dyer said. They can be replenished quickly, unlike batteries, which require a slow recharging. Dyer imagines that owners of cell phones, laptops and pagers will someday refuel their devices by occasionally slipping in a new ampul of methanol.    ``Methanol is inexpensive,'' Dyer said. ``Ampuls of it could be bought from a supermarket.''    Fuel cells are not new devices, although the intense recent interest in them is. They were demonstrated in the 19th century and deployed more than a century later to power NASA's space vehicles. But the internal processing required to produce that continuous stream of electricity high in the sky proved too expensive for daily applications.    That is changing now, as engineering advances have gradually lowered costs. At the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency in Arlington, Va., Robert Nowak, a program manager, said research sponsored by the agency would aid the overladen American soldiers who routinely carry 20 to 30 pounds of batteries on their missions.    ``Fuel cells begin to look very attractive when you consider what you need in the equivalent battery power to run a computer, radio and other gear soldiers must often take with them,'' he said.    But Nowak has not entirely banished batteries from the fuel cells his agency has helped to develop. Like many people in the field, he supports a hybrid, or dual, system that uses both a battery and a small fuel cell. The battery provides peaks of power when needed, and the fuel cell keeps the battery recharged.    ``In principle this means you will only add fuel to the cell from time to time,'' Nowak said. ``The battery will supply any transient power that exc

The findings of the Northwestern University research team led by   Scott Barnett are reported in today's edition of the science  journal Nature.  Department of Energy experts had mixed reactions to the study.   One was skeptical that the experiment, done in a controlled  laboratory setting, could be applied to daily use.  Fuel cells are an alternative power source for cars, power   plants and individual buildings. In a fuel cell, gas and oxygen  react chemically to produce electricity, water, heat -- and  virtually no pollutants.  Utilities and auto makers are pouring millions of dollars into   researching fuel cells as pollution concerns rise. But while the  technology is ready, it is still too expensive for practical use.  One type of fuel cell that shows promise in power plants is the   solid-oxide cell. It runs best on pure hydrogen, which is usually  converted from a natural gas like methane before being injected  into the cell.  Fuel cells powerful enough for power plants run at high   temperatures and can easily convert the natural gas into hydrogen  by recycling their own heat and steam. Smaller fuel cells -- perhaps  big enough to power a single home -- don't produce enough steam to  do that and need costly external converters.  Cutting out the conversion step would make the smaller fuel   cells cheaper.  ``If you could eliminate that extra hardware and just put   natural gas into your fuel cell, you'd be that much closer to  making this a commercial reality,'' Barnett said.  In previous experiments, cells cracked and became caked with   carbon at higher temperatures, and at lower temperatures, the cells  did not produce much electricity.  Barnett was able to make a fuel cell in a lab work at a lower   temperature by using cerium oxide. Cerium oxide, also found in  catalytic converters, makes the methane react quickly.  The success at a lower temperature is significant, said John   Turner, a senior scientist at the Energy Department's National  Renewable Energy Laboratory. Lower temperatures put less strain on  the components, meaning cheaper parts could be used, he said.  But another DOE expert said Barnett's experiment was too limited   to determine whether the process would be simpler.  ``He has not done it on a large enough scale under realistic   operating conditions to draw the conclusions he's drawing,'' said  Michael Krumpelt, manager of the fuel cell program at the Argonne  National Laboratory outside Chicago.

If it can be repeated on a large scale, the finding would make   it cheaper to produce a type of fuel cell that may one day be  common as a low-pollution power source for buildings.  The findings of the Northwestern University research team led by   Scott A. Barnett are reported in Thursday's edition of the science  journal Nature.  Department of Energy experts had mixed reactions to the study.   One was skeptical that the Northwestern experiment, done in a  controlled laboratory setting, could be applied to daily use.  Fuel cells are an alternative power source for cars, power   plants and even individual buildings. In a fuel cell, gas and  oxygen react chemically to produce electricity, water, heat -- and  virtually no pollutants.  Utilities and auto makers are pouring millions of dollars into   researching fuel cells as pollution concerns rise. But while the  technology is ready, it is still too expensive for practical use.  One type of fuel cell that shows promise in power plants is the   solid-oxide cell. It runs best on pure hydrogen, which is usually  converted from a natural gas like methane before being injected  into the cell.  Fuel cells powerful enough for power plants run at high   temperatures and can easily convert the natural gas into hydrogen  by recycling their own heat and steam. Smaller fuel cells -- perhaps  big enough to power a single home -- don't produce enough steam to  do that and need costly external converters.  Cutting out the conversion step would make the smaller fuel   cells cheaper.  ``If you could eliminate that extra hardware and just put   natural gas into your fuel cell, you'd be that much closer to  making this a commercial reality,'' Barnett said.  In previous experiments, cells cracked and became caked with   carbon at higher temperatures, and at lower temperatures, the cells  did not produce much electricity.  Barnett was able to make a fuel cell in a lab work at a lower   temperature by using cerium oxide. Cerium oxide, also found in  catalytic converters, makes the methane react quickly.  The success at a lower temperature is significant, said John   Turner, a senior scientist at the Energy Department's National  Renewable Energy Laboratory. Lower temperatures put less strain on  the components, meaning cheaper parts could be used, he said.  But another DOE expert said Barnett's experiment was too limited   to determine whether the process would be simpler.  ``He has not done it on a large enough scale under realistic   operating conditions to draw the conclusions he's drawing,'' said  Michael Krumpelt, manager of the fuel cell program at the Argonne  National Laboratory outside Chicago.

DEBUG:simuser.search.interfaces.pyterrier:raw text: WORLD MOVING SLOWLY TOWARD ENERGY FREE OF CARBON     Even as the world's expanding population and economy increase atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide that scientists say are warming the earth, the global energy system is moving steadily away from the carbon-rich fuels whose combustion produces the gas.    Experts say that atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide may be double those of the pre-industrial era by the end of the next century. But they also say the levels would be much higher except for a trend toward lower-carbon fuels that has been going on for more than 100 years, but has been largely unnoticed except by a small band of energy specialists.    The question now, they say, is whether the trend can be accelerated enough to stave off or lessen what many scientists believe is a potentially disruptive global warming.    For nearly a century and a half, fuels with high amounts of carbon have progressively been replaced by those containing less. First wood, which is high in carbon, was eclipsed in the late 19th century by coal, which contains less. Then oil, with a lower carbon content still, dethroned King Coal in the 1960s.    Now analysts say that natural gas, lighter still in carbon, may be entering its heyday, and that the day of hydrogen _ providing a fuel with no carbon at all, by definition _ may at last be about to dawn.    As a result, the experts estimate, the world's economy today burns less than two-thirds as much carbon per unit of energy produced as it did in 1860. In the United States, they estimate, the trend toward lower-carbon fuels combined with greater energy efficiency has, since 1950, reduced by about half the amount of carbon spewed out for each unit of economic production.    But because economic growth and population growth have been so rapid over the decades, overall atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide have steadily risen, to the point that the concentrations may well have doubled by the year 2100. Mainstream scientists say that this much carbon dioxide could warm the earth, on average, by 3 to 5 degrees Fahrenheit. By comparison, that is about half as much as it has warmed since the depths of the last ice age 18,000 to 20,000 years ago. A change of this magnitude would likely have widespread consequences for the world's climate, weather and human life.    Now, as representatives of 150 governments meet in Bonn, Germany, in the latest round of global talks on measures to further reduce carbon-dioxide emissions, analysts both in and out of industry say that the next quarter-century is shaping up as a period of technological and economic ferment offering a chance to accelerate the trend toward a low-carbon economy and, eventually, a no-carbon one.    In Bonn, the delegates are trying to work out the details of an agreement forged two years ago in Kyoto, Japan, that could speed up the trend. Their work is not expected to be finished for at least a year, and the Kyoto agreement still must be ratified by a sufficient number of countries after that.    However that may turn out, ``the decarbonization of the energy system is the single most important fact to emerge from the last 20 years of analysis'' of the system, said Dr. Jesse Ausubel, an expert on energy and climate at Rockefeller University in New York City. He predicts that this evolution will produce a carbon-free energy system by the end of the 21st century.    Among some recent signs of the trend are these:    _ The federal Energy Information Administration reported last week that emissions of carbon dioxide by the United States had increased by an average of 1.37 percent a year in the 1990s _ only about half the 2.6-percent rate of growth in economic production. Analysts say the discrepancy is evidence that the economy is being decoupled from carbon.    _ The agency reported this month that the same is generally true in China, the biggest consumer and producer of coal in the world, where coal production has been reported to be dropping lately. ``China has dispelled a commonly held notion th

It's called the Ballard fuel cell, an electrochemical device converts hydrogen and air directly into electricity to run electric motors _ such as those in cars.    There are no nasty byproducts: Its emission is water pure enough to drink.    And there is no need for a slow recharging period after use. The Ballard cell is simply refueled with compressed hydrogen when it runs low.    If the skeptic in you is wondering where these cars with Ballard fuel cells are and where this compressed hydrogen will come from, consider this: DaimlerChrysler has a prototype car on the road in Germany and plans to put fuel cell cars on the market by 2004, along with Toyota and General Motors.    Shell, Texaco and Arco are working on developing the fuel infrastructure with compressed hydrogen necessary to run these cars.    Sound too good to be true? Considering that it was developed by a few scientists and engineers working for next to nothing in a little Canadian town, such an energy source does seem almost unbelievable.    Which makes for a terrific book, written by journalist Tom Koppel.    ``The Ballard fuel cell promises nothing less than to solve some of the world's worst air pollution problems,'' he writes. ``Yet, it all began with a handful of people working on shoestring budgets for a tiny Canadian company, Ballard Power Systems, in a little-known city of North Vancouver.''    Development and implementation of the Ballard fuel cell is discussed in Koppel's book, ``Powering the Future: The Ballard Fuel Cell and the Race to Change the World'' (John Wiley &AMP; Sons, 276 pages).    Geoffrey Ballard, a citizen of Canada and the United States through his parents, did not set out to find an environmentally friendly energy source, Koppel writes. Ballard became interested in the idea when he was director of research for the newly formed conservation office of the Army during the energy crisis of 1973.    Ballard quickly realized that conservation was not a practical means to solve air pollution problems or U.S. dependence on foreign oil. Instead, a cleaner energy source had to be discovered, he decided.    So Ballard quit his well-paid job to start a company to create such an energy source. Tight money forced Ballard and his wife and children to start a restaurant to finance his dream, Koppel writes as he deftly chronicles the ups and downs of such an entrepreneurial effort.    ``In short, taking the Ballard fuel cell to where it is today took inspiration, perspiration, and a heavy dose of serendipity,'' he writes.    Interestingly, as the company began to succeed, so did its stock. Now 35 percent owned by DaimlerChrysler and Ford, Ballard Power Systems stock is up tenfold in the past three years. Daimler and Ballard also agreed to create a separate company called Ballard Automotive that would be owned jointly and would market the fuel cells and fuel cell engines made by DBB.    Although Ballard is a millionaire several times over, money may be the least of his interests.    As he told students graduating from the University of Victoria, British Columbia: ``Do not be patient. All things to do not come to those who wait. Challenge the normal. Question conventional wisdom. ... Dare to be in a hurry to change things for the better.''    Ballard was in a hurry, and his urgency may help us all breathe a little better.

The new energy source is needed because of dwindling supplies of fossil fuels, such as coal and gas, The Indonesian Observer daily Wednesday quoted the ministry as saying. Agus Hartanto, head of the ministry's Technological Research Department, said Tuesday that the new energy source is highly efficient and environment friendly. We estimate that all petroleum fields here will be exhausted by 2020 and gas fields by 2040. This is the reason why we are trying to introduce fuel cell, he said. Research indicates that fuel cell has a lot of competitive advantages. It is highly efficient when converted into electric energy, its gaseous emissions are low, which is good news for the environment, and it is highly flexible, which means it can be used in engines that run on fuels such as hydrogen, methanol, methane, propane, butane and natural gas. According to the ministry, fuel cell is like a type of battery. It is made from various elements and compounds, all of which can be found in Indonesia. fuel cell has not yet been introduced in Indonesia, but new technology has been developed in advanced countries on how to produce it and use it in public transport. We plan to start using it here by 2003 or 2004, said Agus.

DEBUG:simuser.search.interfaces.pyterrier:raw text: A LEADING ALTERNATIVE TO NUCLEAR TESTS FALTERS    Since late August, an effort to build the world's largest laser has suffered a series of embarrassments that have tarnished the project's reputation and undermined its role as leading justification for a ban on nuclear tests.    Now Energy Secretary Bill Richardson says the entire project and its management may have to be restructured, amid soaring cost overruns. And at least one senator has raised questions about whether tiny nuclear explosions to be triggered by the lasers would violate the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.    In the National Ignition Facility, or NIF, as the project is known, powerful lasers would be used to create conditions similar to those in nuclear weapons, allowing scientists to study the reliability of the nation's nuclear stockpile without tests. The lasers, under construction at the Energy Department's Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California, would crush and heat pellets of nuclear fuel with 192 converging beams, generating a rapid release of fusion energy.    That release would create conditions similar to those created by nuclear weapons, allowing scientists to study their properties. Government scientists say that the laser project is a crucial component of the nation's effort to ensure the safety and reliability of its aging nuclear stockpile without actually testing the weapons in nuclear explosions.    Beyond its applications to weapons, moreover, physicists hope that NIF will help them understand the behavior of materials under extreme conditions and explore the possibility that nuclear fusion could be used for the peaceful generation of power.    But NIF, originally estimated to cost $1.2 billion, has been plagued by scheduling delays, technical problems and cost overruns that could go as high as a third of that figure. Its former director, E. Michael Campbell, took a leave of absence in August after questions arose about his academic credentials and announced last week that he was resigning from the laboratory. And even though $800 million has been spent and construction has been under way since 1997, unhappiness in Congress with the overruns means the project faces the threat of cancellation. In the latest blow, a letter to Richardson in late October, Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, questioned whether such experiments themselves might violate the ``zero yield'' provision in Article I of the treaty, which would prohibit any nuclear test of any size. Successful experiments on NIF would release the energy equivalent of about 15 pounds of TNT in an extremely small fraction of a second within a contained vessel.    ``It is troubling that we are planning to ignite thermonuclear explosions at NIF that may violate the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty's ban on nuclear explosions,'' Harkin said in a statement on the letter, citing the administration's pledge not to test while continuing to seek ratification of the treaty, which he also supports.    Asked about the letter, officials at the State Department and the Energy Department said that laser fusion experiments of lower power had always been granted special exemptions during negotiations for test ban treaties, including the latest one.    ``I think it's a fair question that deserves an answer,'' John Holum, senior adviser to the secretary of state for arms control and international security, said of the issue Harkin had raised. Holum, who helped negotiate the test ban treaty, added that during negotiations with other parties to the treaty, ``we specifically carved out that activity as something we expected to continue under a zero yield treaty.''    But the brevity of the Senate's debate on the beleaguered treaty precluded a full discussion of such points, Holum said. The Senate refused to ratify the treaty in October but the Clinton administration still supports the treaty. While the treaty has little chance of passage next year, it is likely to be a campaign issue.    More serious consequences for the program could emerge from Richardson's recent finding that co

But all three agree that high-energy physics is facing an uncertain long-term future.    And although American particle physicists will continue to do trail-blazing research, the directors agreed, hundreds of American scientists have already moved to European laboratories and more will certainly follow.    The three retiring administrators _ Dr. Burton Richter of the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, or SLAC, in California; Dr. John Peoples Jr. of the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, known as Fermilab, in Illinois, and Dr. Christopher Llewellyn Smith, a Briton, of the European Laboratory for Particle Physics, known as CERN, near Geneva, agreed in interviews that the field faced enormous obstacles.    The immediate prospects for particle physics seem as exciting as ever. But the expense of building new high-energy machines runs to billions of dollars, and the era of giant particle accelerators may be approaching its twilight.    Machines that smashed subatomic particles together at energies like that of the Big Bang greatly expanded the horizons of physicists, cosmologists and philosophers in the past few decades, and in the near future they are likely to answer some intriguing questions.    Some examples: What is it that endows all matter with mass? Is there an underlying framework in the universe that ties together gravity with the other forces of nature? Do supposedly fundamental particles like quarks and leptons actually have internal structure? What is the mechanism that created more matter than antimatter in the universal creation event, so that enough matter was left over after the mutual annihilation to build the universe?    Physicists hope that answers to these and other puzzles will emerge from the handful of accelerator laboratories working at the frontiers of physics. But the big question is whether the world's governments are willing to spend the money for such knowledge.    Existing accelerator projects are maintaining the research momentum in the United States. Both SLAC and Fermilab, which have been upgrading their accelerators, are still making important discoveries.    But in 2005, a proton accelerator with a circumference of 17 miles, the Large Hadron Collider, is to begin operating at CERN. From then on, particle physicists agree, the center of high-energy research will shift to Europe.    Because the retiring directors have presided over a critical period of accelerator physics, colleagues regard their passing as bench marks.    Richter, 67, will leave the directorship of SLAC on Aug. 31 after 15 years as chief. While in his 30s, he pioneered the development of colliding-beam accelerators, in which opposing beams of particles slam into each other head-on, creating showers of debris and new particles.    In 1974, using beams of electrons and antielectrons, or positrons, Richter discovered a particle that came to be called Psi/J. It contained two quarks possessing a previously unknown flavor called charm. For this discovery, Richter and Dr. Samuel C.C. Ting of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology shared the 1976 Nobel Prize in Physics.    Peoples, 66, director of Fermilab, will retire on June 30 after 28 years there, 10 as director. Peoples directed the development of a source of antiprotons for use in the colliding beams of Fermilab's gigantic Tevatron accelerator.    In the past few years his main concern has been building a new main injector for the Tevatron, which will soon increase the flow of particles in the opposing beams from a trickle to torrents. The more particles a beam contains the greater the likelihood of collisions with particles in the opposing beam _ collisions that yield discoveries.    The Tevatron is the world's highest energy particle accelerator, and when protons collide with antiprotons inside its

Timothy A. Kral of the University of Arkansas said that a   methane-making, oxygen-hating microbe ``grows just fine and dandy''  in a simulated Martian environment that could not support most  forms of life on Earth.  Kral, who is reporting on his research today at the national   meeting of the American Society for Microbiology, said he and a  colleague, Curtis Bekkum, created an environment in culture dishes  that closely mimics the environment of Mars.  The dishes contained no oxygen, but were bathed in carbon   dioxide and hydrogen gases. The soil in the experiment resembles  what is known about Martian dirt, with no organic nutrients and  only a small trace of water.  ``We make the assumption that there is liquid water beneath the   surface,'' said Kral. Many planet experts believe Mars once had  great amounts of water and that traces of it still remain beneath  the surface.  Into this mix, the researchers placed a group of microbes called   methanogens, a type of bacteria that on Earth lives in places where  there is no oxygen, such as deep under the ground or around sea  floor vents. Some types of methanogens even live in the stomachs of  cows, where they help digest grass.  All of these types of microbes, he said, use nitrogen and   hydrogen to make methane, a natural gas that can be used as fuel.  To determine whether the bacteria lived in the simulated Martian   environment, Kral said he measured the amount of methane produced  inside the sealed culture dishes.  ``It made methane just like it does on Earth,'' he said. ``It   grows just fine in the Martian conditions.''  Although the experiment is far from the final answer, Kral said   the fact that the microbes thrived ``cautiously increases our  belief that life on Mars is possible, or at least it was  possible.''  Kral said the experiment also raises the possibility that the   microbes could be used to cause a change in the planetary climate  of Mars.  ``If man were to go to Mars someday and introduce life, this   might be the form of life that would grow there,'' he said. ``If  you were going to try to create an Earthlike conditions there,  putting this type of organism on Mars might be the thing to start  it.''  Kral said colonies of methanogens would give off methane gas   that could help change the climate and temperature of Mars. The  planet surface now is very cold; but if methane collected in the  atmosphere, it eventually could create a greenhouse effect, he  said.  ``Methane is a greenhouse gas, which means you could warm up the   planet,'' he said. Greenhouse gases allow sunlight to hit the  planet's surface, but prevent the solar heat from escaping back  into space.  Methane also could provide the energy for a human colony on   Mars, said Kral. The gas can be used as fuel and could even be  processed into a rocket propellant.  NASA has been studying the idea of one day sending a   methane-producing robot spacecraft to Mars, Kral said. Using  hydrogen brought from Earth and carbon dioxide from the Martian  atmosphere, it would be possible to make and store methane, he  said. The fuel then would be available when people are eventually  sent to Mars.  ``They could use the methane to rocket themselves back to   Earth,'' he said.  Methanogen microbes, in theory, also could be used on Mars to   make methane and provide the energy needed for a human colony  there, Kral said.

The microbe, said Timothy A. Kral of the University of Arkansas,   ``grows just fine and dandy'' in a simulated Martian environment  that would kill most every other forms of Earth life.  Kral, who is reporting on his research Wednesday at the national   meeting of the American Society for Microbiology, said he and a  colleague, Curtis Bekkum, created an environment in culture dishes  that closely mimics the environment of Mars.  The dishes contained no oxygen, but were bathed in carbon   dioxide and hydrogen gases. The soil in the experiment resembles  what is known about Martian dirt, with no organic nutrients and  only a small trace of water.  ``We make the assumption that there is liquid water beneath the   surface,'' said Kral. Many planet experts believe that Mars once  had great amounts of water and traces of it still remain beneath  the surface.  Into this mix, the researchers placed a group of microbes called   methanogens, a type of bacteria that on Earth lives in places where  there is no oxygen.  Kral said the microbe comes from a family of organisms that   lives on Earth deep under the ground or around sea floor vents.  Some types of methanogens even live in the stomach of cows where  they help digest grass.  All of these types of microbes, he said, use nitrogen and   hydrogen to make methane, a natural gas that can be used as fuel.  To determine if the bacteria lived in the simulated Martian   environment, Kral said he measured the amount of methane produced  inside the sealed culture dishes.  ``It made methane just like it does on Earth,'' he said. ``It   grows just fine in the Martian conditions. In fact, it grew fine  and dandy.''  Although the experiment is far from the final answer, Kral said   the fact that the microbes thrived ``cautiously increases our  belief that life on Mars is possible, or at least it was  possible.''  Kral said the experiment also raises the possibility that the   microbes could be used to cause a change in the planetary climate  of Mars.  ``If man were to go to Mars someday and introduce life, this   might be the form of life that would grow there,'' he said. ``If  you were going to try to create an Earthlike conditions there,  putting this type of organism on Mars might be the thing to start  it.''  Kral said that colonies of methanogens would give off methane   gas that could help change the climate and temperature of Mars. The  planet surface now is very cold; but if methane collected in the  atmosphere, it eventually could create a greenhouse effect, he  said.  ``Methane is a greenhouse gas, which means you could warm up the   planet,'' he said. Greenhouse gases allow the sunlight to hit the  planet surface, but prevent the solar heat from escaping back into  space.  Methane also could provide the energy for a human colony on   Mars, said Kral. The gas can be used as fuel and could even be  processed into a rocket propellant.  NASA has been studying the idea of one day sending a   methane-producing robot spacecraft to Mars, said Kral. Using  hydrogen brought from Earth and carbon dioxide from the Martian  atmosphere, it would be possible to make and store methane, he  said. The fuel then would be available when people are eventually  sent to Mars.  ``They could use the methane to rocket themselves back to   Earth,'' he said.  Methanogen microbes, in theory, also could be used on Mars to   make methane and provide the energy needed for a human colony  there, said Kral.

Everyone was exposed to toxic fumes and explosive flammable materials during the work. The first A-bomb was detonated in northwest China in October, 1964. At the end of 1960, scientists He Zuoxiu, Yu Min, and Huang Zuqia from the Institute of Atomic Energy, were asked to start the research and experimentation of the first hydrogen bomb. All they had to work with were some tables, chairs, several rulers and a blackboard, but they were not discouraged. More scientists and experts, including Zhou Guangzhao, Peng Yuanwu, and Deng Jiaxian, joined in after they finished their A-bomb research. Nuclear weapons are crucial for ensuring national security. As a young and big country, China could not survive without its own nuclear weapons. We are quite willing to labor for the cause of our motherland, said Yu Min, a world-renowned theoretical physicist. These men made a great breakthrough in the study of hydrogen bomb theory in October 1965, and the first H-bomb exploded on June 17, 1967. It took the United States more than seven years to invent the first A-bomb and make strides in the H-bomb theory, while Britain, four and a half years, and the former Soviet Union, four years. China spent just 26 months on the entire project, an extraordinary feat in the eyes of the world.

A team from India's Bhabha Atomic Research Center (BARC) based in Bombay (Mumbai) observed bursts of neutrons -- uncharged particles present in the nucleus of an atom -- during lightning discharges. Dome bursts contained as many as a billion neutrons. Such neutrons are usually released in nuclear reactions. Lightning discharges in the air are already known to carry currents of several tens of kilo amperes, high energy X-rays and gamma rays. The scientists say they have detected neutrons indicating the occurrence of nuclear reactions during lightning. Their findings were reported in the latest issue of the Indian Journal of Radio and Space Physics. The neutrons are probably produced when hydrogen ions (natural hydrogen is present in the form of water) collide with air (containing nitrogen and oxygen) or with trees (containing carbon) or even lightning arresters (containing copper), the scientists say.

DEBUG:simuser.search.interfaces.pyterrier:raw text: SCIENCE NOTES AND NEWS     Bouncing Buckyball    To the list of remarkable properties of those single-molecule spheres of carbon atoms known as buckyballs can be added another: They bounce.    Scientists at the University of California at Berkeley and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory have controlled the movement of a buckyball by making it the centerpiece of a tiny transistor. (Buckyballs consist of 60 carbon atoms and are more formally called buckminsterfullerenes, in honor of the inventor of the geodesic dome, which has the same kind of structure.)    In a typical transistor, like those found by the millions on a computer chip, a voltage from a gate electrode controls the current that flows between two other electrodes, known as the source and drain, across a semiconducting material. In the Berkeley transistor, a buckyball sits between the source and drain electrodes, and the current flows one electron at a time.    Depending on the energy of the electron, it will either be reflected from the buckyball (thus, the transistor is ``off'') or it will hop across to the other electrode (the transistor is ``on,'' allowing current to flow). And at certain energies, the researchers report in Nature, when the electron hops across, it starts the buckyball bouncing between the electrodes.    The researchers suggest that this coupling between the electron's energy and the movement of the buckyball may have eventual applications in very precise control of electron flow in molecular-scale devices. In the meantime, bouncing buckyballs may be a curiosity, but perhaps not a surprising one. After all, a buckyball's structure of 12 pentagons and 20 hexagons is just like that of a classic soccer ball.    Tiniest Fullerene    A sphere of 60 carbon atoms is not the smallest fullerene possible. That distinction belongs to one made up of 20 atoms arranged in 12 pentagons, with no hexagons. (Those who paid attention in school know that this structure is called a dodecahedron.)    The problem with this fullerene was that no one had ever seen it. There were even doubts that it could exist, given the strain caused by the high degree of curvature of such a sphere.    Those doubts have now disappeared, thanks to work by chemists in Germany and the United States, who report in Nature that they have produced the smallest fullerene, although only in its gas phase and only fleetingly.    The researchers made the molecule using dodecahedrane, which has the right 20-carbon structure as its core but comes with hydrogen atoms attached. By gently stripping off the hydrogen atoms in a two-step process, they were able to produce the fullerene.    El Nino's Child: Cholera    El Nino has been blamed for a many things, from destruction of million-dollar hillside homes in California to shrinking marine iguanas on the Galapagos Islands.    Now, researchers from Cornell and the universities of Maryland, Barcelona and London have come up with a new reason to curse El Nino: They have linked it to cholera outbreaks in Bangladesh.    Using mathematical models and data on cholera cases collected over 18 years at a hospital in Dhaka, Bangladesh, the researchers analyzed the role of climate and previous levels of the disease on outbreak patterns. They found that cholera reached a peak every 3.7 years over the 18-year period, the same frequency as El Nino events, in which warming waters in the eastern Pacific disrupt weather patterns worldwide.    Cholera is caused by a bacterium that thrives in plankton in brackish water and in estuaries. The researchers, in a report in Science, suggest that warming of these waters caused by El Nino-related atmospheric changes increases bacteria levels and the risks of human contamination. They note there is an 11-month lag between an El Nino and a rise in cholera cases, which makes sense given that it takes time for the ocean warming in the eastern Pacific to bring about climate changes in South Asia.

DEBUG:simuser.search.interfaces.pyterrier:raw text: COMPANY PLANS FUEL CELLS FOR THE HOME BY 2000  Plug Power LLC says it has developed a cleaner, cheaper and more reliable way of getting electricity into the average home.    Plug Power announced it expects to bring a $3,000 dishwasher-sized power source that can supply all the electricity needed to run the average home by 2000.    Environmentalists and government energy-policy architects attending Wednesday's announcement agreed the fuel-cell technology is a good idea. They like the way fuel cells can produce electricity in a clean, contained process that doesn't generate air pollution the way coal-fired plants do, and that is also more efficient in generating power.    ``We are very interested in promoting this technology not only to consumers, but to municipalities around the state,'' said Daniel R. Mackay, representative of the New York Conservation Education Fund.    The idea behind fuel-cell technology is to take a common fuel, such as natural gas or propane and convert that into hydrogen gas. Early models are starting with hydrogen gas.    Hydrogen molecules are actually split into electrons and protons, with the electrons providing the power that can be converted into electricity for the home. The protons left over react with oxygen in the air and create water, which is emitted from the fuel cell as exhaust. Thin membranes are used as a sort of staging for the whole process.    ``It never stops to boggle my mind that a little Saran Wrap-type material can give you 300 to 400 amps of power, and your average toaster uses 15 amps of power,'' said William Ernst, vice president and technical director of the Latham, N.Y.-based Plug Power.    Fuel cells are manufactured to match the specific energy needs of different categories of consumers. Plug Power's first product will produce 7,000 watts of power, more than enough to handle the energy demands of a 2,000 square-foot home, according to the company.    Already, a modest brick-faced ranch belonging to a company employee is using a demonstration model fuel cell now.    Company employees admitted visitors to the home Wednesday to show how computers, televisions, kitchen appliances, lights and air conditioners can all be powered at the same time from the fuel cell.    Because the electricity is actually produced right on the home site with a delivered fuel such as natural gas or propane from a home tank, it doesn't have to be transmitted through power lines and poles that can be felled in storms.    Plug Power said the power produced by a fuel cell could be 20 percent cheaper than that provided by major utility companies.    In addition, heat expended by the fuel cell can be used to heat water in the home.    Plug Power President Gary Mittleman said he expected utility companies to distribute the systems to residential customers when the first product, the Plug Power 7000, comes onto the market in 2000.    Utility companies may own the product, install it on customer premises and charge for the electricity produced, he said. As the market evolves, customers might buy their own models, perhaps even from appliance dealers.    Other companies also are trying to produce this technology and to get into related markets. Some companies, for instance, are focused solely on fuel cells for cars.    Connecticut-based Onsi Corp. produces fuel cells for commercial buildings that require more power.    GE Power Systems distributes power-generation units for small industrial units, and so goes after a different segment of the power market, according to a spokeswoman.    So far, Plug Power is well-positioned to be the leader in the U.S. residential market, said Jean M. Redfield, president of DTE Edison Electric, which is one of Plug Power's two corporate parents.    Plug Power also has its eye on markets in China, Latin America and other countries where some regions lack extensive power-grid systems, executives said, as well as industrialized nations that are grappling with air-pollution problems.

This was revealed by Padmanabha Krishnagopala Iyengar, former chairman of the Indian Atomic Energy Commission and one of the prominent scientists involved in the design of the country's first nuclear bomb. There was so much euphoria after the first successful nuclear test, it would have been the best time for testing the hydrogen device, Iyengar told newsmen here in an informal chat early this week at the conference on The Role of Nuclear Energy in Sustainable Development, the PTI said. Some government advisers warned the then prime minister, Indira Gandhi, of adverse international reactions. One of them said that Air India would not be able to fly its planes because it would be denied spare parts, the PTI quoted Iyengar as saying. According to Iyengar, the hydrogen test could have pushed India closer to being declared a weapon power instead of being placed in the current situation where it is neither here nor there.

DEBUG:simuser.search.interfaces.pyterrier:raw text: A giant radioactive souffle is rising toward the top of a million-gallon tank of nuclear waste buried in the desert near Richland, Wash.    Whipped up unexpectedly by a pump that was supposed to dissipate pockets of hydrogen gas, the waste has smothered one tube for vapor sampling, threatens other instruments and could eventually overflow, according to officials of the Department of Energy and the contractor in charge of the tank, Lockheed Martin Hanford Corp. They are rushing to pump some of the waste into another tank, possibly within a month.    In May, workers stopped the growth, at least temporarily, by lancing the crust with high-pressure water jets, but the hole they made is beginning to close.    ``I don't make any claims about this tank,'' said Donald Oakley, a retired environmental expert from Los Alamos National Laboratory, hired by the Energy Department as an outside consultant. ``I'm not convinced anyone understands the chemistry and physics involved in this crust.''    At the Washington State Department of Ecology, Mike Wilson, manager of the nuclear waste program, said that before the crust was lanced, engineers were predicting the waste would reach the top of the tank this fall. ``It was `The Blob' kind of thing,'' he said.    The 20-year-old tank, called SY-101, is buried just under the surface at the Hanford nuclear reservation, 20 miles from Richland, a city of about 32,000 people. The tank produces unwanted hydrogen as radiation fields bombard organic chemicals that were added years ago in what officials now say was a mistaken strategy to reduce the waste's volume.    Until six years ago, the hydrogen was emitted in huge releases that official studies call burps, causing ``waste-bergs,'' chunks of waste floating on the surface, to roll over.    With the tank belching thousands of cubic feet of gas at roughly 100-day intervals, Energy Department officials were afraid that at some point it would burp during a lightning storm and cause an explosion. ``Under certain conditions, you could rupture the tank,'' said Leo Duffy Jr., who was the Energy Department's chief environmental official during the Bush administration. ``You'd have a challenge on your hands in the state of Washington,'' he said.    An explosion would spread radioactive material into the environment, experts say.    In retrospect, the gassy eructations were the good old days.    To reduce the chance of fire or explosion, the Energy Department ordered installation of a huge pump in July 1993 to break the hydrogen into tiny bubbles, which engineers hoped would then rise to the surface like carbon dioxide fizzing out of a soft drink.    For a time that worked. But engineers theorize that the crust started to toughen because it no longer rolled over from time to time, and it prevented the hydrogen from coming to the surface. In December 1997, the crust began to rise, even though virtually nothing was being added to the tank.    The waste's surface climbed from about 403 inches above the bottom of the tank to 435 inches at its peak, before workers lanced it, with each inch representing almost 3,000 gallons. That level was 13 inches above the maximum specified for the tank's operation. By Friday, the waste had risen again to 432 inches. The tank is protected by a double shell, but the waste is within 2 feet of the level at which the outer shell ends.    ``We were getting awfully close, closer than we wanted to be,'' said Dr. Carolyn Huntoon, assistant secretary of energy for environmental management.    The crust also grew downward, and could eventually threaten the intake nozzle of the mixer pump. Experts say that if it clogged the pump, the hydrogen would begin accumulating at the bottom again and burping to the surface, but the crust that would then roll over would be four times bigger than it was before the pump was installed. And the vapor space at the top of the tank would be far smaller, making it easier to reach a hydrogen concentration that would support a fire or explosion.    ``The roll

But the top 11 floors of the sleek glass exterior are unusual.    The building's fashionable, light-blue skin contains an array of electricity-generating solar panels.    Dig a little deeper, and you'll find a bank of giant fuel cells lurking on the fourth floor, silently turning natural gas into power. Four Times Square is its own freestanding environmentally friendly electric utility.    ``As soon as corporate dealmakers and the general public understand the value of these kinds of buildings, they're going to insist on them,'' predicts Bob Fox, the building's lead architect.    Since Edison's first lightbulb, an increasing number of people have tied their energy fulfillment needs to the grid of interconnected power lines. Now the trend is reversing, and do-it-yourself power is taking off.    Local blackouts and Y2K anxieties have home owners and office managers alike worrying about a power-grid failure.    At the same time, freestanding energy sources are getting cleaner, cheaper and prettier. They can even be money-savers.    Thirty states now require utilities to use net metering, which allows consumers who generate their own power to cut their energy bills by selling back any excess.    Soon, many buildings could sport solar cells on the roof, natural-gas turbines and fuel cells in the basement and a link to a wind turbine up the hill.    Some of the most dramatic changes have popped up in solar power, long dismissed as visually unappealing and impractically expensive.    Architects who once shunned bulky blue solar panels are marveling at solar cells incorporated discreetly into the surface of roofing shingles, windows, skylights and wall facades.    Misawa Homes of Japan, that nation's largest home builder, recently showed off its spare, modernist Eco Energy House, which turns its solar accoutrements into elegant design elements.    In the United States, President Clinton has launched the Million Solar Roofs Initiative to get solar-energy tiles on the tops of 1 million buildings by 2010.    Meanwhile, prices keep dropping. Two decades of engineering sweat have brought solar electricity costs down to an average of 20 cents per kilowatt-hour.    In sunny cities like San Diego, an equivalent flow of conventional electricity during peak daytime hours can cost as much as 28 cents, says Nancy Bacon, senior vice president of Energy Conversion Diversion in Troy, Mich. At night, solar homes in San Diego can switch to power from the local utility.    First Solar in Toledo, Ohio, is starting to grow transparent solar cells directly onto glass panes during their manufacture, at a total cost only slightly higher than that of conventional glass.    Each day, a typical glassmaker rolls out 600 tons of panes for use in buildings. If just one plant were converted for making solar glass following First Solar's technique, the glass it produced would generate about 1 gigawatt of power a year, says Gary Dorer, the company's vice president of technology.    ``That's almost 10 times more than today's total solar-power production worldwide,'' he says.    Fuel cells could also generate compact, do-it-yourself power. The cells generate electricity by combining hydrogen _ usually drawn from a fuel like natural gas or methanol _ with oxygen, launching chemical reactions that spark a current. They work silently and cleanly.    Four Times Square uses the cells for only a fraction of its total power needs, but in other settings they could pull much heavier duty. A basement fuel cell working in tandem with solar cells on a house's roof could churn out all the necessary local energy, rain or shine.    ``From a tactical standpoint, it's a beautiful combination,'' says Thomas Hoff, head of Clean Power Research in Napa, Calif.

DEBUG:simuser.search.interfaces.pyterrier:raw text: NUCLEAR SITE IS BATTLING A RISING TIDE OF WASTE  A giant radioactive souffle is rising toward the top of a million-gallon tank of nuclear waste buried in the desert near Richland, Wash.    Whipped up unexpectedly by a pump that was supposed to dissipate pockets of hydrogen gas, the waste has smothered one tube for vapor sampling, threatens other instruments and could eventually overflow, according to officials of the Department of Energy and the contractor in charge of the tank, Lockheed Martin Hanford Corp. They are rushing to pump some of the waste into another tank, possibly within a month.    In May, workers stopped the growth, at least temporarily, by lancing the crust with high-pressure water jets, but the hole they made is beginning to close.    ``I don't make any claims about this tank,'' said Donald Oakley, a retired environmental expert from Los Alamos National Laboratory, hired by the Energy Department as an outside consultant. ``I'm not convinced anyone understands the chemistry and physics involved in this crust.''    At the Washington State Department of Ecology, Mike Wilson, manager of the nuclear waste program, said that before the crust was lanced, engineers were predicting the waste would reach the top of the tank this fall. ``It was `The Blob' kind of thing,'' he said.    The 20-year-old tank, called SY-101, is buried just under the surface at the Hanford nuclear reservation, 20 miles from Richland, a city of about 32,000 people. The tank produces unwanted hydrogen as radiation fields bombard organic chemicals that were added years ago in what officials now say was a mistaken strategy to reduce the waste's volume.    Until six years ago, the hydrogen was emitted in huge releases that official studies call burps, causing ``waste-bergs,'' chunks of waste floating on the surface, to roll over.    With the tank belching thousands of cubic feet of gas at roughly 100-day intervals, Energy Department officials were afraid that at some point it would burp during a lightning storm and cause an explosion. ``Under certain conditions, you could rupture the tank,'' said Leo Duffy Jr., who was the Energy Department's chief environmental official during the Bush administration. ``You'd have a challenge on your hands in the state of Washington,'' he said.    An explosion would spread radioactive material into the environment, experts say.    In retrospect, the gassy eructations were the good old days.    To reduce the chance of fire or explosion, the Energy Department ordered installation of a huge pump in July 1993 to break the hydrogen into tiny bubbles, which engineers hoped would then rise to the surface like carbon dioxide fizzing out of a soft drink.    For a time that worked. But engineers theorize that the crust started to toughen because it no longer rolled over from time to time, and it prevented the hydrogen from coming to the surface. In December 1997, the crust began to rise, even though virtually nothing was being added to the tank.    The waste's surface climbed from about 403 inches above the bottom of the tank to 435 inches at its peak, before workers lanced it, with each inch representing almost 3,000 gallons. That level was 13 inches above the maximum specified for the tank's operation. By Friday, the waste had risen again to 432 inches. The tank is protected by a double shell, but the waste is within 2 feet of the level at which the outer shell ends.    ``We were getting awfully close, closer than we wanted to be,'' said Dr. Carolyn Huntoon, assistant secretary of energy for environmental management.    The crust also grew downward, and could eventually threaten the intake nozzle of the mixer pump. Experts say that if it clogged the pump, the hydrogen would begin accumulating at the bottom again and burping to the surface, but the crust that would then roll over would be four times bigger than it was before the pump was installed. And the vapor space at the top of the tank would be far smaller, making it easier to reach a hydrogen concentration that

DEBUG:simuser.search.interfaces.pyterrier:raw text: FIRM'S `SNIFFER' UNITS FRAGRANT WITH POTENTIAL Five years ago, over frankfurters and beer at a hot dog stand, aerospace consultants David Haberman and David Walker decided to take a chance.    The pair had learned of a technology developed at Sandia National Laboratory in New Mexico and available for commercialization that used an air-sniffing computer chip to detect hydrogen gas. Believing hydrogen would play a growing role in industry, and that existing sensors were too expensive and bulky to keep pace, Walker and Haberman created DCH Technology Inc. to bring the technology to market.    The rest, as they say, is history.    Well, not quite. After five years, the Valencia-based company's three standard-bearer products are starting to gain acceptance. But so far, DCH has generated little in the way of sales, with 1998 revenues of $215,000 and a net loss of more than $4 million. The company's stock, which peaked as high $8.25 following its initial public offering in 1996, closed Friday at $1.    Still, Walker and Haberman say they are confident of the firm's prospects. ``We have no debt, the founders remain in control of the company and our products are quite good,'' said Haberman, DCH's chairman and vice president of planning.    At least a few others agree. James Stock's Stock Tips, a Las Vegas-based investor newsletter, declared the company was ``farther along than they've ever been to meeting their corporate goals'' and said it may be one of the market's best-kept secrets.    At the heart of the DCH game plan is the sensor chip itself. Developed at Sandia, a U.S. Department of Energy research lab, it consists of a thin layer of palladium nickel alloy sandwiched on top of an integrated circuit. When it comes into contact with hydrogen atoms, even at minute levels, the alloy spits protons directly into the integrated circuit's logic cells.    Using that same basic technology, DCH has developed a hand-held device for hunting down leaks, a model for installation on hydrogen-powered devices, and a version for use in permanent locales where hydrogen might seep out, such as at a nuclear power plant or waste-treatment center. Together, the three applications have a potential market of $200 million, the company estimates.    By outsourcing the manufacturing of the sensors to industrial giant Allied Signal, DCH has managed to keep its staff and capital investments down. The company's staff of 11 consists primarily of engineers working to refine the sensor and develop new applications.    Haberman and Walker, meanwhile, have been working to establishing relationships with a bevy of blue chip names they hope will result in 1999 sales of between $3 million and $4 million. A DCH sensor flew aboard a NASA space shuttle mission last year to test the device's extraterrestrial applications. Westinghouse recently certified the technology for use at a Russian nuclear power plant it is retrofitting. And Northrup Grumman Corp. is using DCH products in its metallurgy division. Other customers include Ford Motor Co., Lockheed Martin Defense Systems and the U.S. Naval Medical Research Institute.    Still, the fact remains that demand for hydrogen sensors of any sort is limited. While the element is a key ingredient in the fuel cells that environmentalists believe will one day power cars, hydrogen sensor sales currently total in the thousands worldwide, not millions. But if just two or three companies opted to include DCH devices on a broad basis -- say, in every fuel-cell car Ford produces -- it would mean a windfall for the company, Haberman said.    With increased sniffing of DCH by investors and customers alike, Haberman said things look positive. ``We've been distinctly poor at communications . . . but the neat part is the phone keeps ringing'' from potential customers, he said. ``It just seems like everything's clicking and coming together.''

Physicists, who among other things invented the World Wide Web, have been quick to realize that their lexicon is no longer too obscure for pop songs.    ``The language is so lyrical, and I think it lends itself to poetry,'' said Lynda Williams, also known as the Physics Chanteuse.    ```Boson, get it on,''' she continued, referring to a species of subatomic particle. ``You know, everything rhymes.''

Physicists, who among other things invented the World Wide Web, have been quick to realize that their lexicon is no longer too obscure for pop songs.    ``The language is so lyrical, and I think it lends itself to poetry,'' said Lynda Williams, also known as the Physics Chanteuse.    ```Boson, get it on,''' she continued, referring to a species of subatomic particle. ``You know, everything rhymes.''    Other thriving acts, like the Chromatics, an a cappella group, and Les Horribles Cernettes, a doo-wop band from Geneva, harmonize about everything from gamma rays to quarks to quantum theory.    Will the Cernettes' ``Liquid Nitrogen'' hit the Top 40? Probably not. But then again, maybe audiophiles should reserve space in their collections for a coming invasion of warbling scientists.    _ By JAMES GLANZ    (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)Williams, who teaches introductory physics and astronomy at San Francisco State University, recently released a CD titled ``Cosmic Cabaret,'' a sort of greatest hits collection.

Hundreds of participants from North America, South America and Europe will hear scientists, business leaders and government officials assess the role of biomass as a leading energy source in the next century, said the U.S. Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) Thursday. In California, whose biomass energy is the largest in the world, several major commercial biomass and bioenergy demonstration projects are supported by the California Energy Commission. According to NREL, the U.S. vision is to spur the growth of a domestic biomass industry to produce power, fuels and chemicals from crops, trees and waste. One goal is to make a ton of biomass compete with a barrel of imported oil. NREL director Richard Truly said earlier this week that America must invest in its energy future now. Otherwise, the nation could face supply shortage and fall behind of foreign competitors. The United States now imports more than half of its oil at a cost of 52 billion U.S. dollars annually. Truly said that U.S. policy and research and development decisions should recognize that worldwide energy demand will outstrip the supply of fossil fuels in coming decades. Laboratory scientists have made great strides in learning how to produce environmentally friendly hydrogen from sunlight and water and how to store it. Progress also has been made in bioenergy, the use of plants to produce fuels, chemicals and other products. But Truly said that this progress is at risk. Without a commitment to to bring those technologies to market, he said, the science will go wasted.

DEBUG:simuser.search.interfaces.pyterrier:raw text: FUEL CELL WILL SUPPLY POWER TO N.Y. TEST HOUSE  For the first time, an energy technology called a fuel cell will supply all the power to a suburban house, another sign that fuel cells are on the verge of acceptance as an economical alternative to traditional energy sources.    The idea of fuel cells _ which convert liquid fuel into electricity through a chemical reaction rather than combustion _ has been around for more than 100 years. But until recently, fuel cells were so expensive that it was practical only for NASA's specialized use on space missions. But the cells being tested now are powerful, flexible and reliable enough to work as an affordable earth-bound energy source.    On Wednesday, a team of engineers will cut off the electricity the local utility company provides to a brick ranch-style house in Latham, N.Y., and switch on a back-porch component that looks more like a home central air-conditioning unit than the small chemical plant it really is.    Developments in the past few weeks include the first commercial sale of a fuel cell for remote power (to the New Jersey Department of Transportation, for a traffic warning sign) and the first street-ready car powered by a fuel cell (built by students at Humboldt State University in California). And in April, Ford put $420 million into Ballard Power Systems, a fuel cell company in Vancouver, B.C., in which Daimler-Benz already has a major investment.    Officials at the Energy Department, which is helping to pay for the test in Latham, say they have high hopes that within a few years thousands of homes will be drawing electric power from fuel cells powered by natural gas or propane, cutting pollution and consuming less fuel than conventional energy production.    ``In the last year, we've seen significant breakthroughs,'' said Energy Secretary Federico Pena in a telephone interview. ``We're going to see fuel cells in homes, cars and other uses much sooner than we had predicted.''    Dan Reicher, the assistant secretary for energy efficiency and renewable energy, said, ``The launch of a fuel-cell-powered house is up there with the introduction of the electric refrigerator, the room air-conditioner and the fluorescent light.''    What has made fuel cells more practical has been improvements in the gossamer-thin components, which look like plastic food wrap or aluminum foil, that are used to turn a basic chemical reaction _ the combination of oxygen and hydrogen to make water _ into the basis of an energy revolution.    The heart of the fuel cell being used in house in Latham and being studied for use in automobiles is called a proton-exchange membrane. When a hydrogen atom _ one proton and one electron _ is pressed against that membrane, the proton passes through and the electron is left behind. That creates a positive charge on one side of the membrane and a negative charge on the other; wire them together, and the result is a flow of electricity.    Jonathan Leonard, the program supervisor for fuel cells at California's South Coast Air Quality Management District, one of many government agencies eagerly watching the research, said: ``Splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen is a simple process that takes electricity. Combining them to make water and electricity, well, you don't get much simpler than that. I don't think there are many doubters.''    Certainly not Michael Walsh, a mechanical engineer who is a consultant to the company running the Latham test, Plug Power, and who lives in the house five days a week with, among other devices, a stereo, a personal computer and a clock radio that wakes him in the morning. They will operate the same, whatever the electricity source, he said, and people inside the house ``won't know whether we are running on the grid or not.''    But for all the breakthroughs, fuel cells are still much too expensive for everyday use. The car companies, which would probably be the biggest users of an efficient fuel cell, say that they still cost roughly 100 times more per horsepower than an inter

DEBUG:simuser.search.interfaces.pyterrier:raw text: ELUSIVE SUBATOMIC PARTICLE HAS MASS, SCIENTISTS REPORT In what colleagues hailed as a historic landmark, 120 physicists from 23 research institutions in Japan and the United States announced on Friday that they had found the existence of mass in a notoriously elusive subatomic particle called the neutrino.    The neutrino, a particle that carries no electric charge, is so light that it was assumed for many years to have no mass at all. After Friday's announcement, cosmologists will have to confront the possibility that much of the mass of the universe is in the form of neutrinos. The discovery will also compel scientists to revise a highly successful theory of the composition of matter known as the Standard Model.    Word of the discovery had drawn some 300 physicists here to discuss neutrino research. Among other things, they said, the finding of neutrino mass might affect theories about the formation and evolution of galaxies and the ultimate fate of the universe. If neutrinos have sufficient mass, their presence throughout the universe would increase the overall mass of the universe, possibly slowing its present expansion.    Others said the newly detected but as yet unmeasured mass of the neutrino must be too small to cause cosmological effects. But whatever the case, there was general agreement here that the discovery will have far-reaching consequences for the investigation of the nature of matter.    Speaking for the collaboration of scientists who discovered the existence of neutrino mass using a huge underground detector called Super-Kamiokande, Dr. Takaaki Kajita of the Institute for Cosmic Ray Research of Tokyo University said that all explanations for the data collected by the detector except the existence of neutrino mass had been essentially ruled out.    Dr. Yoji Totsuka, leader of the coalition and director of the Kamioka Neutrino Observatory where the underground detector is situated, 30 miles north of here in the Japan Alps, acknowledged that his group's announcement was ``very strong,'' but said, ``We have investigated all other possible causes of the effects we have measured and only neutrino mass remains.''    Dr. John Bahcall, a leading neutrino expert and astrophysical theorist at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., said in an interview that there had been many claims in recent years of the discovery of neutrino mass by other groups. ``But this one is by far the most convincing,'' he said. ``Besides the strong evidence they have found, this team has a magnificent track record of discoveries.''    But because the elusive particles cannot be seen, the evidence that they have mass is indirect.    Under the Standard Model of matter, neutrinos come in three types or ``flavors.'' The data gathered by the Super-Kamiokande team during the two years the detector has operated indicate that at least one of these three ``flavors'' can ``oscillate'' into one of the other flavors as it travels along at nearly the speed of light. According to the theories of quantum mechanics, any particle capable of transforming itself in this way must have mass.    Study of the neutrino particle has been glacially slow since its existence was hypothesized in 1931 by the Austrian physicist Wolfgang Pauli as a way to explain the mysterious loss of energy in certain nuclear reactions. The particle was finally discovered in 1956 by two physicists at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, Dr. Frederick Reines (who was awarded a Nobel Prize for the discovery) and the late Dr. Clyde Cowan.    But understanding of the particle since then has been acquired painfully slowly, because neutrinos have no electric charge and rarely interact with any kind of matter. A neutrino so rarely collides with an atom of ordinary matter that a typical neutrino can easily penetrate a one-light-year thickness of lead _ some six trillion miles _ without hindrance.

So begins Dr. Jesse L. Greenstein's remembrance of a paper he had first published in the July 1, 1964, issue of The Astrophysical Journal concerning the likely energy source of the distant, shockingly luminous objects called quasars.    The paper and remembrance appear in a new, 1,283-page compendium of what have been judged the 53 most important papers to appear in The Astrophysical Journal and The Astronomical Journal in the 20th century.    Affectionately known as Ap.J. and A.J., the journals are the most respected and important in astronomy. They have chronicled astronomy's journey from the turn-of-the-century debate over whether the Milky Way made up the entire cosmos to the present view that Earth's galaxy is one obscure smudge of stars and gas hurtling apart from billions of others in the wake of the Big Bang.    With each paper there is an accompanying article placing the original contribution in context and bringing its implications up to date. Some of the accompaniments are by original authors, some by astronomers of more recent vintage.    Dr. Jeremiah P. Ostriker of Princeton, for example, comments on an October 1937 paper by Dr. Fritz Zwicky of the California Institute of Technology that provided the first evidence that the universe might be full of a strange kind of ``dark matter'' _ a mysterious substance that still baffles astronomers.    That date, notes Ostriker in his comment, meant the original paper was published ``six months after my own birth, and so, no doubt, conceived before I was.''    The century's best were chosen by a panel of astronomers led by Dr. Donald E. Osterbrock of the University of California in Santa Cruz. Behind the exercise was more than a desire to hand out blue ribbons, according to Dr. Helmut A. Abt, who stepped down as editor in chief of Ap.J. last year, after nearly 30 years in the job.    ``Some people are tempted to think that most of the important results were derived in the past decade or two,'' Abt wrote in the introduction to the volume. But, he went on with a veteran's measured ire, ``it is sometimes surprising to discover how many basic results were obtained many years ago.''    One early debate involved the size of the universe. Astronomers knew that a crucial clue lay in the nature of what they called the spiral nebula, of which a prominent example was an object called Messier 31 in the constellation Andromeda. Were they wisps of gas and dust in the cozy confines of the Milky Way or ``island universes,'' meaning whole galaxies themselves, lying far away?    In 1925, the astronomer Edwin Hubble set that question to rest in a paper in Ap.J. titled ``A Spiral Nebula as a Stellar System, Messier 31.'' Based on about 350 photographs taken with the 100-inch and 60-inch reflecting telescopes at Mount Wilson in California, the largest telescopes of the day, the paper showed that the nebula's spiral arms contained swarms of faint stars, including variable stars and novas, and that it was much too distant to be contained in the Milky Way.    ``This paper clearly ended all doubts that the spiral galaxies were extragalactic,'' wrote Dr. Arthur D. Code of the University of Wisconsin in a commentary. The finding also made it easier to swallow Hubble's next big discovery, in 1929, that all those other galaxies are rushing apart from one another _ the hallmark of the Big Bang that most astronomers now believe gave birth to the universe.    A whole series of papers explored starlight: how the energy of nuclear fusion reactions fuels the brilliance of stars and builds up heavier and heavier elements from the hydrogen, helium and other small change left over from the Big Bang.    When these stars explode as novas and supernovas, they spread those elements through the cosmos. Without the heavy ele

The doors clang shut, and the group plunges hundreds of stories down into the darkness _ No. 5 Shaft in South Africa's East Driefontein gold mine. The goal: to find living microbes living deep in the Earth.    Within moments the air becomes oppressively hot. This is one of the farthest-reaching excavations in the world, burrowing more than two miles toward the center of Earth.    At the bottom of the mine, radioactivity and heat from the planet's core raise the temperature of the stone in the tunnels to a searing 120 F, and the atmospheric pressure is double that on the surface.    Oxygen rarely exists naturally so far underground, and only a constant rush of forced air from the surface disperses poisonous methane and hydrogen seeping from the rock. Pumped-in jets of water help keep workers from slowly cooking to death.    Geologist T.C. Onstott, a Princeton professor, pulls a water bottle from his knapsack and takes a swig. To him, the heat and claustrophobia are merely aggravation. Real worry for the team of scientists, as well as the miners, centers on ``seismic events'' _ high-pressure cave-ins that kill.    It is difficult to obtain samples from wells that have not been contaminated by air or water from the surface. Onstott decided he had to find a way to visit the microbes himself. The mine he chose to explore is part of a sprawling manmade underworld started on a Sunday morning in 1886 when an Australian prospector found a gold-rich outcrop on the present site of Johannesburg.    Like a nose peeping out of the covers, that outcrop was just the start. Since then, three-quarters of the gold ever mined has come out of the region. The most recent shaft at East Driefontein took 15 years to excavate _ and that was just the vertical hole.    For his journey into this biosphere, Onstott rounded up an all-star crew of microbiologists. They included: Bill Ghiorse, who led Environmental Protection Agency research into subsurface bacteria that eat toxic waste; Duane Moser, a lab wizard and avid spelunker; Svetlana Kotelnikova, a Russian scientist working in Sweden; Mary DeFlaun of Envirogen, an environmental technology firm; and Jim Fredrickson, who has isolated many deep-bacteria cultures while working at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.    At East Driefontein, Onstott and his team would spend three months gathering samples at a depth where no microbe hunters had ventured before: The No. 5 Shaft bottoms out at 11,222 feet.    On this scouting mission, the elevator slowly comes to a halt at 6,120 feet and the researchers walk through a short tunnel to a second elevator that takes them to the mine's deepest diggings. At the bottom, the group boards a miniature train for a half-mile ride through the dark as a giant air pipe roars overhead.    The train stops at a dark hole in the wall: the stope, or mining face. The passage dips down at a steep angle; in many sections the ceiling is only three feet high.    The stope swarms with miners. Drills, saws and jackhammers roar so loudly that hand signals must be used. Amid the pandemonium, the scientists find their objective: a black coal-like vein interwoven with round stones and sparkly filaments.    This mineral-rich seam is dubbed the carbon leader. Often no more than a finger wide, sandwiched in a mass of ancient quartzite, the carbon leader is heavily laced with uranium and holds an extraordinary concentration of gold.    No one is certain how the carbon leader formed. It could be the remains of either algae that settled on an ancient sea bottom or oil that shot through a crack underground. In any case, the rock formation is loaded with carbon compounds potentially nutritious to microbes.    Strong evidence that microbes could survive in an even more

KENDALL, 72, DIES; HUNTED DOWN QUARK     Dr. Henry Way Kendall, one of three physicists who shared a Nobel Prize for confirming that tiny particles called quarks were the basic building blocks of matter, died on Monday while on an underwater photography shoot in Wakulla Springs State Park, south of Tallahassee, Fla. He was 72 and lived in Sharon, Mass.    The local authorities reported that Kendall, an experienced diver and underwater photographer, had joined a team from National Geographic magazine but was working by himself before his body was found a few feet from shore. An autopsy was being performed.    Kendall was also known for his work with the Union of Concerned Scientists, an advocacy group that he helped found in 1969 and led as chairman since 1973.    Kendall and his colleagues won the 1990 Nobel Prize in Physics for experiments that confirmed the existence of quarks, the infinitesimally tiny packets of energy that make up protons and neutrons, which were once thought to be matter's fundamental particles. Dr. Richard E. Taylor, a Canadian professor at Stanford University, and Dr. Jerome I. Friedman, a fellow scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, were recognized with Kendall.    Their work from 1967 to 1973 validated what had been hypothesized independently in the early 1960s by Dr. Murray Gel-Mann and Dr. George Zweig at the California Institute of Technology. Gell-Mann named these elusive particles ``quarks'' on a whim, borrowing the word from James Joyce's ``Finnegan's Wake.''    Kendall, Taylor and Friedman, who first met as graduate students at Stanford, conducted their research at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center using a two-mile-long particle accelerator able to boost beams of electrons to an energy of 22 billion electron-volts. They directed the beams at targets containing liquid hydrogen.    The purpose was to achieve a special kind of collision that occurs when electrons hit protons (which constitute the nuclei of hydrogen) at certain energies. Initial results were ambiguous. But as the three fine-tuned their instruments, the results clearly showed that both protons and neutrons contained hard, electrically charged, point-like particles corresponding to the quarks foretold in theory.    That confirmation allowed physicists to proceed confidently with developing what is known as the standard model theory of matter. The Nobel Prize panel applauded their feat as a ``breakthrough in our understanding of matter.''    In his role with the Union of Concerned Scientists, Kendall opposed President Ronald Reagan's ``Star Wars'' anti-missile project, and he challenged the concept that such a system could defend American cities from nuclear attack.    Kendall consistently warned of the dangers of nuclear weapons, space-based arsenals and radiation leaks from nuclear power generators. His organization also studied the greenhouse effect, a warming of the earth's climate as a result of emissions of heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide. Kendall helped to brief President Clinton on the subject.    Kendall, who was born in Boston, graduated from Amherst College in 1950 and received a Ph.D. in nuclear physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1955. He was a National Science Foundation Fellow at MIT at the time. He lectured at Stanford before joining the MIT faculty in 1961, rose to full professor in 1967 and was named as the J.A. Stratton Professor of Physics in 1991.    His research interests covered nucleon structure, high-energy electron scattering, and meson and neutrino physics. He was a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the recipient of the 1981 Leo Szilard Award of the American Physical Society and a 1982 Bertrand Russell Society Award.    Kendall is survived by a brother, John, also of Sharon.

But two  scientists predict the collision will uncover only a concrete-like  layer of dry soil.  NASA researchers plan to smack the Lunar Prospector craft into a   crater on the moon's South Pole on July 31, the final day of the  lunar orbiter's $63 million, 18-month-long mission to study the  moon at close range.  Experts believe water ice may be locked in the frigid soil of   the deep, constantly shaded crater and that roiling energy of the  satellite's 3,800 mph impact will free a cloud of water vapor.  The search for water may be a key to further lunar exploration.   Water can be chemically reduced to hydrogen and oxygen, which can  be used as a rocket fuel. Also, the oxygen could be used as a  breathable gas. The presence of water would reduce the need for  fuel and oxygen resupply from Earth of a lunar base.  But Von R. Eshleman and George A. Parks, researchers at Stanford   University, say in a letter to the journal Science that Lunar  Prospector is more apt to collide with a concrete-like mineral  inside the crater than ice.  ``We don't believe that crater is paved like a roadway, but we   do believe the soil may be chemically very much like concrete,''  Eshleman said in an interview.  If there is water on the moon, Eshleman said, it is probably in   the form of hydrous, or water-containing, mineral crystals.  Hydrous minerals do contain H2O, but it is so tightly bound   chemically to the crystals that it would take temperatures up to  1,500 degrees to break those bonds and extract useful water, he  said.  Eshleman agrees with National Aeronautics and Space   Administration scientists that if there is any water on the moon --  a highly uncertain possibility -- it probably is in the soils in  deeply shaded craters at the lunar poles. But once the water got  trapped there, he said, the water very likely combined with the dry  lunar soil to form the crystal minerals.  David Goldstein, a University of Texas researcher who first   suggested smashing the moon with the Lunar Prospector, conceded  that some lunar water may be chemically locked in minerals, but he  thinks there also might be ice.  ``We think the chances of there being free water there is about   10 percent,'' he said.  Goldstein said the energy released by the Lunar Prospector's   crash into the moon will vaporize ice, but not separate water from  the minerals.  ``In a half cubic meter of soil, the crash will raise the   temperature by about 400 degrees Kelvin (about 720 degrees F),''  said Goldstein, far less than the 1,500 degrees F needed to extract  the water from a concrete-like crystal.  This means that if any water is detected from the collision, it   probably came from ice, not from hydrous minerals, said Goldstein.  Lunar Prospector was launched Jan. 6, 1998, and has spent 18   months orbiting the moon. It used instruments to map the lunar  surface, plot the moon's geology and search for water.  Data from the spacecraft suggested the presence of hydrogen, a   key component of water, but could not detect water itself. Radar  signals from an earlier spacecraft, called Clementine, suggested  that water ice might be present at the cold lunar poles. And still  another study, using Earth-bound instruments, detected a group of  craters at the lunar poles that are constantly shaded from the sun,  the sites thought the most likely to contain ice.  The craft will smash into one such shaded crater at about 5:52   a.m. EDT on July 31.  ``We selected that day because the funding for Lunar Prospector   runs out on Aug. 1,'' said Goldstein, a member of the spacecraft  science team. ``We thought this would be a good way to end the  mission and still get some science.''  Controllers will order Lunar Prospector to fire its braking   rockets, Goldstein said, and if all goes well the craft will  approach the surface at a

Stars are being born as well as dying, said Dr. Nolan Walborn, an astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, but the rate varies greatly from galaxy to galaxy.    One mission of the Hubble Space Telescope is to observe star-formation regions, he said.    Stars form from huge clouds of dust and gas. If a cloud begins to contract because of its own gravity, its interior heats up as gravitational energy is converted to heat energy, reaching millions of degrees, and nuclear reactions begin that change one element into another, releasing energy.    The pressure tends to expand the cloud back out, Walborn said, but eventually equilibrium is reached. ``That is what a star is,'' he said, ``a mass of gas at equilibrium between gravity's inward pressure and outward pressure from nuclear reactions.''    A star has a finite lifetime because it is burning fuel. For 90 percent of its life, it burns hydrogen into helium. When the hydrogen is used up, the pressure decreases, but gravity never disappears, so the star contracts until the temperature climbs again, this time reaching hundreds of millions of degrees, while reactions convert helium to carbon and oxygen. The star can then remain stable for a briefer time. Eventually the star dies, when the reactions only consume energy but do not produce it.    &QL;

In studies at the University of Montana, researchers developed   antibodies in mice that attacked HIV, the virus that causes AIDS,  just as the virus was in the process of fusing with target cells.  A report on the study was being published today in the journal   Science.  This fusion process, the researchers said, exposed HIV molecules   that are not open to attack at other times in the infection cycle.  These molecules were then injected into laboratory mice. The   injected mice, which had been genetically manipulated to respond to  HIV, made antibodies against the fusion molecules.  When tested in laboratory dishes against actual samples of HIV,   the mouse antibodies were able to neutralize 23 of 24 strains of  the virus.

Now chemists have taught single molecules of this plastic a more impressive trick _ how to snatch and store energy from light in the way that plants do.    The researchers, based as the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, are aiming to build a new breed of cheap polystyrene-based batteries. They say the batteries could be used to provide power for anything from cars to cellphones.    The project is part of continuing efforts by Tom Meyer and his colleagues at Los Alamos to find simple materials that can mimic the complex chemistry of photosynthesis, which allows plants to store energy from sunlight in chemical bonds.    The first step in photosynthesis is the absorption of a photon-a particle of light-by an antenna composed of the green pigment chlorophyll. This energy is then used to propel electrons around the chemical bonds of the molecules involved in the reaction, ultimately stripping electrons from water to make oxygen, and adding them to carbon dioxide to create energy-rich sugars.    Meyer's team had already managed to recreate each of these steps separately, using different synthetic molecules that work in conjunction with an atom of the metal ruthenium. In his latest experiments, he decided to link these molecules on a polymer backbone.    ``Because polystyrene polymers are so widely used, their chemistry is very well understood,'' he says. ``So it was an obvious choice for the backbone.''    To test out the new molecule, the researchers zapped a solution of it with a laser. As they had hoped, some side chains containing the ruthenium antennas were able to absorb the light energy and pass it along the polymer chain. When the energy reached another type of ruthenium complex, it was able to do some chemical work, pushing an electron to a different part of the complex. Mobilizing electrons in this way is what batteries do-supplying electrons from an anode that can be drawn around a circuit and back towards its cathode.    Michael Wasielewski, a photosynthetic chemist at Northwestern University in Chicago, thinks Meyer's choice of polymer was the key.    ``All the right properties are there,'' he says. ``And we already have robust manufacturing technology to work with polystyrene. It's a nice piece of work.''    Because polystyrene derivatives are inexpensive to create, Meyer thinks his polymer holds great promise for a wide array of devices _ such as solar-powered fuel cells that pull electrons from water to create hydrogen fuel or to generate an electric current.    For now, his team's main aim is to increase the efficiency with which the molecules convert energy, which is now hovering around 15 percent.    ``There's a lot of hard work ahead, but you have to expect that,'' he says. ``After all, it took natural photosynthesis more than a billion years to evolve.'' &QL;   &UR; (This article is excerpted from New Scientist, a weekly science and technology magazine based in London.) &LR;  &QC;

The goal: to find living microbes living deep in the Earth.    Within moments the air becomes oppressively hot. This is one of the farthest-reaching excavations in the world, burrowing more than two miles toward the center of Earth.    At the bottom of the mine, radioactivity and heat from the planet's core raise the temperature of the stone in the tunnels to a searing 120 F, and the atmospheric pressure is double that on the surface.    Oxygen rarely exists naturally so far underground, and only a constant rush of forced air from the surface disperses poisonous methane and hydrogen seeping from the rock. Pumped-in jets of water help keep workers from slowly cooking to death.    Geologist T.C. Onstott, a Princeton professor, pulls a water bottle from his knapsack and takes a swig. To him, the heat and claustrophobia are merely aggravation. Real worry for the team of scientists, as well as the miners, centers on ``seismic events'' _ high-pressure cave-ins that kill.    It is difficult to obtain samples from wells that have not been contaminated by air or water from the surface. Onstott decided he had to find a way to visit the microbes himself. The mine he chose to explore is part of a sprawling manmade underworld started on a Sunday morning in 1886 when an Australian prospector found a gold-rich outcrop on the present site of Johannesburg.    Like a nose peeping out of the covers, that outcrop was just the start. Since then, three-quarters of the gold ever mined has come out of the region. The most recent shaft at East Driefontein took 15 years to excavate _ and that was just the vertical hole.    For his journey into this biosphere, Onstott rounded up an all-star crew of microbiologists. They included: Bill Ghiorse, who led Environmental Protection Agency research into subsurface bacteria that eat toxic waste; Duane Moser, a lab wizard and avid spelunker; Svetlana Kotelnikova, a Russian scientist working in Sweden; Mary DeFlaun of Envirogen, an environmental technology firm; and Jim Fredrickson, who has isolated many deep-bacteria cultures while working at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.    At East Driefontein, Onstott and his team would spend three months gathering samples at a depth where no microbe hunters had ventured before: The No. 5 Shaft bottoms out at 11,222 feet.    On this scouting mission, the elevator slowly comes to a halt at 6,120 feet and the researchers walk through a short tunnel to a second elevator that takes them to the mine's deepest diggings. At the bottom, the group boards a miniature train for a half-mile ride through the dark as a giant air pipe roars overhead.    The train stops at a dark hole in the wall: the stope, or mining face. The passage dips down at a steep angle; in many sections the ceiling is only three feet high.    The stope swarms with miners. Drills, saws and jackhammers roar so loudly that hand signals must be used. Amid the pandemonium, the scientists find their objective: a black coal-like vein interwoven with round stones and sparkly filaments.    This mineral-rich seam is dubbed the carbon leader. Often no more than a finger wide, sandwiched in a mass of ancient quartzite, the carbon leader is heavily laced with uranium and holds an extraordinary concentration of gold.

Substantial financial marketing and organizational resources are currently being devoted to fuel cell technology, driving the nascent market from approximately 40 million U.S. dollars in 1999 to over 10 billion dollars by 2010, said the report from Allied Business Intelligence, a U.S. technology research think-tank. The report examined the U.S. and global markets for the leading fuel cell technologies producing from 50 watts to 30 megawatts, including phosphoric acid, proton exchange membrane, alkaline, molten carbonate, solid oxide and zinc-air. In the United States, the report said, a number of companies are beginning to release products, and many of the market entrants are backed by large international energy and power production equipment firms. Although power from early fuel cells costs more than power from other generators, a number of applications can be identified in which price is not the key determinant, the report said. Markets for reliable power and quality power are potential areas of use for the technology, as are applications involving industrial waste hydrogen, wastewater treatment gas and agribusiness animal waste gas. According to the research, regions of the United States with high power rates or no grid access are being targeted by companies that produce low power fuel cells. These systems can use natural gas and propane to provide the electricity, hot water and building heat for single family homes and small businesses. The market will expand into power supplies for vacation homes and cabins, remote villages and islands, telecommunications relay towers, industrial plants, military bases and more.

India had come a long way since it conducted its first nuclear test in 1974 as the country's scientists had been working on the data base to improve the design of nuclear weapons and modernize them, he said. Kalam, who is also chief of Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO), said that the required data have been obtained through the five nuclear tests in May this year for carrying out simulation for future development by the scientists and technologists. The country had several super computers in various research institutions including the Atomic Energy Commission and there would be no hurdle on this score, he added. India by signing the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) would not face any difficulties in its nuclear weapons program since the country has generated the desired data from its recent nuclear tests. We are capable of conducting underground sub-critical tests after signing the CTBT, if necessary, he said. From the scientific and technical angle, it is our considered view that no further nuclear tests are necessary and subscribing to the CTBT would not create difficulties for our nuclear status, he added.

They said the equipment uses only 0.93 kilowatts/hour to make one cubic meter of hydrogen gas -- believed to be the lowest figure in the world. Before the equipment was invented, the researchers here were using about 8 kilowatt/hour to turn out one cubic meter of hydrogen. However, local hydrogen producers noted that large-scale production of hydrogen with this equipment will still be quite costly. About 26 to 36 billion yuan (3.1 to 4.3 billion US dollars) is needed to build a coastal plant with daily capacity of 100 million cubic gas based on this technology. Moreover, the research team was reported to have developed even more sophisticated equipment which used only 0.0093 kilowatt/hour to produce one cubic meter of hydrogen, but scientists said that there are too many difficulties involved and the cost of making such equipment and accessories is prohibitive. Virtually pollution-free hydrogen is expected to replace other conventional fuels in the coming century. The research outcome is expected to be published on the Internet shortly.

(AP) -- The Army will be ''cleaner and greener'' when it begins testing cleaner-burning alternative fuels for the National Energy Technology Laboratory this fall, a scientist says.    Under a formal agreement the two agencies were expected to sign today, the Army will equip its fleet of Humvees, tanks and Jeeps with special instruments to monitor how the fuels burn, then send that data back to the lab.    The Army was targeted in part because of its impact on air pollution: It has some 250,000 vehicles worldwide, said Diane Hooie, senior adviser in the lab's Strategic Center for Natural Gas.    The agreement gives the lab a testing ground and, eventually, a buyer for both battery-like fuel cells and liquid fuels made from coal, oil, natural gas and waste products from landfills and sewage-treatment plants.    The Department of Energy has four research programs with multiple projects under way at the lab to develop fuels that burn with little or no emissions.    The alternative fuels are safe and stable, Hooie said, but significantly more expensive than gasoline and diesel because they are not yet mass-produced.    The Army will try various fuels on 100 vehicles at a time for several years. If the fuels are compatible with existing pumps and engines, their use would be expanded.    The lab has about 1,200 employees in Morgantown and Pittsburgh, and nearly $70 million of its annual $482.5 million budget goes toward research on alternative fuels and fuel cells.    Fuel cells operate like batteries, generating electrochemical power from a hydrogen-rich source like natural gas, methanol or sewage waste, Hooie said. The anodes and cathodes that in a normal battery actually supply the power in a fuel cell simply facilitate it.    ''It's quiet, there's no waste and there are no moving parts,'' Hooie said.    Some fuel cells are already commercially available but not yet widely used. They have potential applications in luxury vehicles and for long-haul truckers, who could use them for auxiliary power as they rest.  AP-NY-05-18-00 0346

DEBUG:simuser.search.interfaces.pyterrier:raw text: JUPITER'S STORY WEATHER IS LIKE EARTH'S, ONLY MORE SO     The weather on Jupiter seems always stormy. Lightning flashes deep in the enveloping gas clouds. Eddies of atmospheric turbulence bob along the margins of jet streams, feeding energy into titanic, long-lived whirlpools.    Thunderheads tower more than 30 miles above surrounding clouds, and new observations reveal that moist heat rising in these stormy updrafts probably supplies the energy driving most Jovian weather.    Scientists analyzing photographs taken by the Galileo spacecraft, orbiting the largest planet in the solar system, have concluded that this moist convection of thunderstorms on Jupiter is similar to that on Earth _ only more so _ but is generated by heat from a completely different source: from deep in the planet, not from sunlight.    Other scientists said the new findings, reported in the current issue of the journal Nature, appeared to solve the mystery of how Jupiter gets the energy for such a constantly stormy weather system, although many questions remain unanswered.    A team of astronomers led by Dr. Peter J. Gierasch of Cornell University found the most telling evidence in images, from visible and infrared light, of the south equatorial belt, a region west of Jupiter's Great Red Spot, a seemingly permanent storm in the southern hemisphere.    Lightning was visible there before dawn. A few hours later, a cluster of huge Earthlike storms developed there. The scientists estimated that the vertical transport of heat by such storms corresponded to the flux generated by the planet's internal heat source.    ``We therefore conclude that moist convection is a dominant factor in converting heat flow into kinetic energy in the Jovian atmosphere,'' Gierasch's group wrote.    In another report, a group led by Dr. Andrew P. Ingersoll of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena said the lightning preceding the storms was a critical clue indicating the presence of large amounts of water in the deep clouds. Nothing else, they noted, could condense at depths of as much as 60 miles below the upper layer of the atmosphere.    ``So we can use lightning as a beacon that points to the place where there are rapidly falling raindrops and rapidly rising air columns _ a source of energy for the eddies,'' Ingersoll explained. ``The eddies, in turn, get pulled apart by shear flow and give up their energy to these large-scale features. So ultimately, the Great Red Spot gets its energy and stays alive by eating these eddies.''    On Earth, violent storms like hurricanes and cyclones are fueled by the warm ocean. The water is heated by sunlight, which drives all terrestrial weather. But Jupiter is 5 times farther from the Sun than is Earth and sunlight is only 4 percent as strong there as on Earth, not enough to generate the observed tempests.    Scientists have long assumed that Jupiter's internal heat somehow churns the thick atmosphere. Because of the heat reservoir of highly compressed hydrogen at its core, the planet generates nearly 70 percent more heat than it absorbs from the Sun. But how did that heat rise from the depths to drive Jovian weather?    Moist convection had been proposed as the mechanism, said Dr. Alvin Seiff of the Ames Research Center in Mountain View, Calif., but there was no firm evidence until now.    In an accompanying journal article, Seiff said the new research represented ``a notable advance in our knowledge of Jupiter's weather by demonstrating that moist convection occurs and transports significant amounts of energy.''    But he said, ``Much work remains for us to gain a broad description of Jupiter's fluid behavior.'' One remaining uncertainty is what circulation is like deeper below the outer layers of the planet's thick clouds.

DEBUG:simuser.search.interfaces.pyterrier:raw text: EARTH MAY HAVE LONG-LOST SISTERS  Several Earth-like planets, created billions of years ago during the formation of our solar system, may be wandering in deep space harboring conditions that could sustain some form of life, according to a new theory proposed by a prominent planetary scientist.    These orphan worlds, ejected from the solar system by gravitational forces during its tumultuous beginnings, may have retained atmospheres rich in molecular hydrogen even as they were flung into the dark void of interstellar space, said Dr. David J. Stevenson, a professor of planetary science at the California Institute of Technology.    The rogue planets, instead of being cold, icy masses meandering among the stars as some astronomers have believed, could be warm bodies with dense, insulating atmospheres that trap enough volcanic heat to sustain water oceans and some types of simple life forms, he said in an interview.    ``The idea of Earth-sized bodies being ejected when the solar system formed is not new,'' Stevenson said, ``But instead of being uninteresting frozen balls of barren matter, I am proposing that they could have acquired a dense atmosphere and maintained it to act as an insulating blanket to sustain Earth-like temperatures in the absence of sunlight.''    The idea that life could exist in such seemingly inhospitable conditions has been bolstered in recent years by the discovery of a variety of unusual creatures living in lightless, sulfurous environments at the ocean floor, warmed by heat from undersea vents. These discoveries have fueled speculation that life might exist elsewhere in the universe, though possibly in forms that would seem strange to ordinary humans.    Stevenson described his theories in the current issue of the journal Nature. Stevenson said that if planetary systems around other stars formed in similar ways, then there could be billions of such interstellar planets flung into space. If life can develop and be sustained without sunlight on these planets, he wrote, ``it is conceivable that these are the most common sites of life in the universe.''    Stevenson said his idea of dark, life-sustaining planets moving among the stars is drawn from linking several accepted concepts of planetary theory and his own calculations. ``This is just an idea, but it comes together plausibly,'' he said.    Dr. Jack J. Lissauer, a specialist in planet formation at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Ames Research Center in California, said Stevenson's idea is an ``interesting'' one that extends earlier work by numerous other scientists. ``David Stevenson put all these parts together and has raised the possibility of something that is really far out, but not ridiculous,'' he said, ``It makes some sense.''    Dr. Alan P. Boss, a solar system specialist at the Carnegie Institution of Washington's Department of Terrestrial Magnetism, said the new theory ``is a logical extension of what people have proposed for a long time about the early solar system.''    When the solar system was formed about 4.5 billion years ago from primal gases and dust coming together, Boss said, the process produced multiple cores that tried to become planets near the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn. Some of these bodies became parts of the giant planets when drawn in by their gravity, he said, while others passed nearby and were flung away in a slingshot effect that propelled them out of the solar system.    This process was responsible for knocking about a trillion small bodies out of the infant solar system, causing them to form a giant sphere of debris in deep space that surrounds the sun and its planets. This debris, called the Oort cloud, is believed to be the source of most comets that enter the solar system.    ``If the Oort cloud was formed by many small bodies being knocked out of the solar system, it is not a great leap to imagine losing a few Earth-sized bodies the same way,'' Boss said.    According to Stevenson, there were about a half-dozen Earth-like planets in Jupite

The 51-percent state-owned company notified the Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate of plans to build the plant, to be called HydroKraft, pending approval by government agencies.    The company said if it receives the proper approvals in 1999, construction of the plant would be completed during 2002 and production startup would occur in early 2003.    Earlier this year, the company announced a new technology that would allow it to use clean-burning hydrogen to generate electricity. The hydrogen for the plant would be extracted from natural gas.    Norsk Hydro, a major petroleum producer, now says studies have shown the proposal to be economically viable. It also said the plant's carbon dioxide emissions would be 90 percent lower than plants using natural gas.    Norway is the world's second-largest oil exporter, and also produces vast amounts of natural gas from its offshore fields. Virtually all of the country's electricity now comes from hydroelectric plants.    Under the company's plans, natural gas, air and water would be mixed to produce hydrogen, nitrogen and carbon dioxide.    Norsk Hydro wants to build the plant at Karmoey, an island about 500 kilometers (300 miles) west of Oslo.

 indonesia studies new alternative energy source 


jakarta, september 6 (xinhua) -- the indonesian government is
considering developing a new source of energy, known locally as"
fuel cell," the research and technology ministry said.


the new energy source is needed because of dwindling supplies
of fossil fuels, such as coal and gas, the indonesian observer
daily wednesday quoted the ministry as saying.


agus hartanto, head of the ministry's technological research
department, said tuesday that the new energy source is highly
efficient and environment friendly.


"we estimate that all petroleum fields here will be exhausted
by 2020 and gas fields by 2040. this is the reason why we are
trying to introduce fuel cell," he said.


research indicates that fuel cell has a lot of competitive
advantages. it is highly efficient when converted into electric
energy, its gaseous emissions are low, which is good news for the
environment, and it is highly flexible, which means it can be used
in engines that run on fuels such as hydrogen, methanol, methane,
propane, butane and natural gas.


according to the ministry, fuel cell is like a type of battery.
it is made from various elements and compounds, all of which can
be found in indonesia.


"fuel cell has not yet been introduced in indonesia, but new
technology has been developed in advanced countries on how to
produce it and use it in public transport. we plan to start using
it here by 2003 or 2004," said agus."

 researcher makes cheaper fuel cell 


	a researcher says he has made an experimental fuel cell that is  
simpler than others because it runs on natural gas instead of pure 
hydrogen. 


	if it can be repeated on a large scale, the finding would make  
it cheaper to produce a type of fuel cell that may one day be 
common as a low-pollution power source for buildings. 


	the findings of the northwestern university research team led by  
scott a. barnett are reported in thursday's edition of the science 
journal nature. 


	department of energy experts had mixed reactions to the study.  
one was skeptical that the northwestern experiment, done in a 
controlled laboratory setting, could be applied to daily use. 


	fuel cells are an alternative power source for cars, power  
plants and even individual buildings. in a fuel cell, gas and 
oxygen react chemically to produce electricity, water, heat -- and 
virtually no pollutants. 


	utilities and auto makers are pouring millions of dollars into  
researching fuel cells as pollution concerns rise. but while the 
technology is ready, it is still too expensive for practical use. 


	one type of fuel cell that shows promise in power plants is the  
solid-oxide cell. it runs best on pure hydrogen, which is usually 
converted from a natural gas like methane before being injected 
into the cell. 


	fuel cells powerful enough for power plants run at high  
temperatures and can easily convert the natural gas into hydrogen 
by recycling their own heat and steam. smaller fuel cells -- perhaps 
big enough to power a single home -- don't produce enough steam to 
do that and need costly external converters. 


	cutting out the conversion step would make the smaller fuel  
cells cheaper. 


	``if you could eliminate that extra hardware and just put  
natural gas into your fuel cell, you'd be that much closer to 
making this a commercial reality,'' barnett said. 


	in previous experiments, cells cracked and became caked with  
carbon at higher temperatures, and at lower temperatures, the cells 
did not produce much electricity. 


	barnett was able to make a fuel cell in a lab work at a lower  
temperature by using cerium oxide. cerium oxide, also found in 
catalytic converters, makes the methane react quickly. 


	the success at a lower temperature is significant, said john  
turner, a senior scientist at the energy department's national 
renewable energy laboratory. lower temperatures put less strain on 
the components, meaning cheaper parts could be used, he said. 


	but another doe expert said barnett's experiment was too limited  
to determine whether the process would be simpler. 


	``he has not done it on a large enough scale under realistic  
operating conditions to draw the conclusions he's drawing,'' said 
michael krumpelt, manager of the fuel cell program at the argonne 
national laboratory outside chicago."

"fuel cell may be the future `battery' 



   the next time the batteries in your laptop or cell phone conk
out at the most inconvenient moment, take heart.


   scientists are fine-tuning an invention that may eventually
replace not only those fallible batteries but even the recharger.


   the invention is the fuel cell, a device that may one day sit
neatly inside your mobile phone or laptop. it uses the reaction of
hydrogen and oxygen to generate a continuous stream of electricity
for days on end with no help whatsoever from a battery.


   fuel cells were once seen as future power sources for cars,
buses and power stations, but inventors are now proposing them for
the subkilowatt world of portable electronics. they may soon come
to the aid of soldiers, police officers and even everyday commuters
who are weary of the inconvenience of their battery packs,
rechargers and spare aas.


   some experts say the latest fuel cells may provide a power
source that weighs far less, and lasts far longer, than any battery
on the market, in part because of their efficient use of hydrogen.


   ``fuel cells have a simply amazing ability to extract energy
from the hydrogen atom,'' said dr. christopher dyer, a senior
member of the technical staff at motorola labs in tempe, ariz., who
is the inventor of a fuel cell designed for use in portable
electronic devices.


   the principle of every hydrogen-based fuel cell is that when
hydrogen is joined to oxygen, forming water, energy is produced.
the energy takes the form of electricity and some waste heat. the
byproducts, depending on the source of the hydrogen, are a bit of
water vapor and, often, carbon dioxide, which is vented from the
fuel cell.


   give the fuel cells enough hydrogen, plus the oxygen that is
provided free in the atmosphere, dyer said, and they could power
devices like cell phones for days, weeks or even months. the
hydrogen that drives these small marvels will probably be provided
by methanol, a compound commonly known as wood alcohol that
contains hydrogen, dyer said.


   ``a liter of methanol should provide enough electricity to run a
laptop for more than a week,'' dyer said. ``a lithium ion battery
of comparable volume has a tenth of that energy.'' lithium ion
batteries, commonly used in laptops, each provide about three hours
of energy.


   fuel cells have another advantage besides a high energy output,
dyer said. they can be replenished quickly, unlike batteries, which
require a slow recharging. dyer imagines that owners of cell
phones, laptops and pagers will someday refuel their devices by
occasionally slipping in a new ampul of methanol.


   ``methanol is inexpensive,'' dyer said. ``ampuls of it could be
bought from a supermarket.''


   fuel cells are not new devices, although the intense recent
interest in them is. they were demonstrated in the 19th century and
deployed more than a century later to power nasa's space vehicles.
but the internal processing required to produce that continuous
stream of electricity high in the sky proved too expensive for
daily applications.


   that is changing now, as engineering advances have gradually
lowered costs. at the defense advanced research projects agency in
arlington, va., robert nowak, a program manager, said research
sponsored by the agency would aid the overladen american soldiers
who routinely carry 20 to 30 pounds of batteries on their missions.


   ``fuel cells begin to look very attractive when you consider
what you need in the equivalent battery power to run a computer,
radio and other gear soldiers must often take with them,'' he said.


   but nowak has not entirely banished batteries from the fuel
cells his agency has helped to develop. like many people in the
field, he supports a hybrid, or dual, system that uses both a
battery and a small fuel cell. the battery provides peaks of power
when needed, and the fuel cell keeps the battery recharged.


   ``in principle this means you will only add fuel to the cell
from time to time,'' nowak said. ``the battery will supply any
transient power that exc"

journal nature. 


	department of energy experts had mixed reactions to the study.  
one was skeptical that the experiment, done in a controlled 
laboratory setting, could be applied to daily use. 


	fuel cells are an alternative power source for cars, power  
plants and individual buildings. in a fuel cell, gas and oxygen 
react chemically to produce electricity, water, heat -- and 
virtually no pollutants. 


	utilities and auto makers are pouring millions of dollars into  
researching fuel cells as pollution concerns rise. but while the 
technology is ready, it is still too expensive for practical use. 


	one type of fuel cell that shows promise in power plants is the  
solid-oxide cell. it runs best on pure hydrogen, which is usually 
converted from a natural gas like methane before being injected 
into the cell. 


	fuel cells powerful enough for power plants run at high  
temperatures and can easily convert the natural gas into hydrogen 
by recycling their own heat and steam. smaller fuel cells -- perhaps 
big enough to power a single home -- don't produce enough steam to 
do that and need costly external converters. 


	cutting out the conversion step would make the smaller fuel  
cells cheaper. 


	``if you could eliminate that extra hardware and just put  
natural gas into your fuel cell, you'd be that much closer to 
making this a commercial reality,'' barnett said. 


	in previous experiments, cells cracked and became caked with  
carbon at higher temperatures, and at lower temperatures, the cells 
did not produce much electricity. 


	barnett was able to make a fuel cell in a lab work at a lower  
temperature by using cerium oxide. cerium oxide, also found in 
catalytic converters, makes the methane react quickly. 


	the success at a lower temperature is significant, said john  
turner, a senior scientist at the energy department's national 
renewable energy laboratory. lower temperatures put less strain on 
the components, meaning cheaper parts could be used, he said. 


	but another doe expert said barnett's experiment was too limited  
to determine whether the process would be simpler. 


	``he has not done it on a large enough scale under realistic  
operating conditions to draw the conclusions he's drawing,'' said 
michael krumpelt, manager of the fuel cell program at the argonne 
national laboratory outside chicago."

 army to test clean fuels  
by vicki smith


   morgantown, w.va. (ap) -- the army will be ''cleaner and
greener'' when it begins testing cleaner-burning alternative fuels
for the national energy technology laboratory this fall, a
scientist says.


   under a formal agreement the two agencies were expected to sign
today, the army will equip its fleet of humvees, tanks and jeeps
with special instruments to monitor how the fuels burn, then send
that data back to the lab.


   the army was targeted in part because of its impact on air
pollution: it has some 250,000 vehicles worldwide, said diane
hooie, senior adviser in the lab's strategic center for natural
gas.


   the agreement gives the lab a testing ground and, eventually, a
buyer for both battery-like fuel cells and liquid fuels made from
coal, oil, natural gas and waste products from landfills and
sewage-treatment plants.


   the department of energy has four research programs with
multiple projects under way at the lab to develop fuels that burn
with little or no emissions.


   the alternative fuels are safe and stable, hooie said, but
significantly more expensive than gasoline and diesel because they
are not yet mass-produced.


   the army will try various fuels on 100 vehicles at a time for
several years. if the fuels are compatible with existing pumps and
engines, their use would be expanded.


   the lab has about 1,200 employees in morgantown and pittsburgh,
and nearly $70 million of its annual $482.5 million budget goes
toward research on alternative fuels and fuel cells.


   fuel cells operate like batteries, generating electrochemical
power from a hydrogen-rich source like natural gas, methanol or
sewage waste, hooie said. the anodes and cathodes that in a normal
battery actually supply the power in a fuel cell simply facilitate
it.


   ''it's quiet, there's no waste and there are no moving parts,''
hooie said.


   some fuel cells are already commercially available but not yet
widely used. they have potential applications in luxury vehicles
and for long-haul truckers, who could use them for auxiliary power
as they rest.

 &ht;   


 &ur; (distributed by the new york times special features) &lr;  &qc;

   (undated) _ it looks increasingly likely that the eventual
replacement for the internal-combustion engine in motor vehicles
will be the fuel cell.


   this is a device that reacts hydrogen and oxygen together to
release electrical energy. environmentalists like it, because its
exhaust is water. and, after some initial hesitation, the world's
car makers are now investing heavily in turning it into a practical
reality.


   the latest prototype comes from general motors. the archly named
hydrogen1 is a third of the size of the company's previous version,
yet it produces about 60 percent more power _ 80 kilowatts, the
equivalent of an average 1,600cc engine _ and gm's researchers
estimate its thermal efficiency at somewhere between 53 percent and
67 percent.


   in other words, up to two-thirds of the energy in hydrogen1's
fuel is ultimately channelled to the vehicle's wheels. that is
nearly four times more than the best gas-engined vehicles.


   the car maker claims to have achieved several other significant
breakthroughs with hydrogen1.


   it can operate at temperatures as cold as -40degreesc. even in
such conditions, it takes less than 30 seconds to boost itself into
operation, compared with five minutes or more for existing fuel
cells.


   but it is its compactness that really makes it look a plausible
predecessor to a production version.


   the fuel cell and hydrogen-storage system in the previous
prototype took up not only the engine compartment of an opel
zafira, but the vehicle's trunk and half the rear seat as well.


   hydrogen1 squeezes most of its hardware under the hood, while
raising the floor of the trunk by a modest 10cm (2.5 inches) and
the rear seat by 4cm. and the fuel tank, which holds enough
hydrogen to drive the car some 600km (400 miles), is the same size
as an ordinary gas tank.


   this environmental (and, potentially, commercial) paragon is not
the result of some startling breakthrough. it is, rather, the sum
of a lot of humdrum engineering refinements.


   these include simpler pipework, miniaturized electronics and a
better understanding of the ``envelope'' of operating conditions
that a commercially available vehicle must be able to tolerate.


   the previous prototype was found to be overdesigned. by paring
things back to match capabilities to requirements, a smaller,
cheaper fuel cell becomes possible.

"engineering studies


   some scientists and engineers have argued that fusion energy is
inherently impractical because a fusion reactor costing billions of
dollars would quickly wear out. the flood of very high-energy
neutrons produced by hydrogen fusion penetrates metal and disrupts
its crystalline structure, causing it to expand and become
dangerously brittle. if the neutron bombardment were to reach the
metal wall of a reactor's vacuum chamber, the entire chamber could
eventually collapse, destroying the reactor.


   most of the latest reactor plans call for capturing the neutrons
in a metal ``blanket'' (probably made of lithium) surrounding the
hot plasma fuel. the neutrons would heat the blanket, and this heat
would be transferred to a steam boiler to power a conventional
turbine. the lithium blanket and some other internal components of
the reactor would wear out in a few years, but could be
periodically removed and replaced at relatively modest cost. the
main part of the reactor would be spared. &ql;


   inertial confinement


   besides compressing and igniting fusion fuel magnetically, the
fusion reactions could also be ignited by an implosion as in
hydrogen bombs.


   in an inertial confinement reactor, the mixture of deuterium and
tritium fuel is encapsulated as a thin frozen coating on the inside
of tiny plastic hollow spheres. for each shot, a sphere is encased
in a metal ``hohlraum,'' a chamber about the size of a pencil
eraser placed at the focus point of 192 powerful lasers.


   when the lasers hit the hohlraum, it emits a blast of x-rays
that vaporize and compress the fuel sphere it encloses, imploding
the sphere and raising the temperature of the fuel inside it to the
ignition point, 100 million degrees celsius or so. during the brief
fusion reaction that ensues, the immense energy it produces is
absorbed by a surrounding metal ``blanket,'' which transfers heat
to a steam-powered electric generating plant.


   this will be the basis of the $1.2 billion national ignition
facility under construction at lawrence livermore national
laboratory in california. because experiments using the machine
will help to monitor the combat readiness of america's arsenal of
nuclear weapons, part of its financing comes from the department of
energy weapons program. &ql;


   z pinch


   a variant of inertial confinement fusion called a ``z pinch'' is
under development at sandia national laboratories in albuquerque,
n.m.


   this device would implode little thermonuclear fuel capsules
like those the livermore laboratory is developing, but without
lasers. instead, scientists have invented a cylindrical array of
very fine tungsten wires and a gigantic capacitor, a device that
can store and instantaneously discharge huge electric charges.


   when the sandia capacitor is fired, it sends a current of 20
million amperes through the fine wires in the z pinch, and the
wires are converted into super-hot plasma. the plasma is driven
inward upon itself by the huge magnetic field produced by the
sudden current. the collision of the imploding plasma generates a
gigantic x-ray pulse and this, it is hoped, can implode fuel
capsules to reach ignition.


   the z pinch and a more powerful successor planned by sandia, the
x-1, will not ignite a sustained reaction but should produce a
pulse of fusion."

"inventor's impatience may help the world breathe easier



   help may be on the horizon to fight severe air pollution in big
cities under federal pressure to clean up their act.


   it's called the ballard fuel cell, an electrochemical device
converts hydrogen and air directly into electricity to run electric
motors _ such as those in cars.


   there are no nasty byproducts: its emission is water pure enough
to drink.


   and there is no need for a slow recharging period after use. the
ballard cell is simply refueled with compressed hydrogen when it
runs low.


   if the skeptic in you is wondering where these cars with ballard
fuel cells are and where this compressed hydrogen will come from,
consider this: daimlerchrysler has a prototype car on the road in
germany and plans to put fuel cell cars on the market by 2004,
along with toyota and general motors.


   shell, texaco and arco are working on developing the fuel
infrastructure with compressed hydrogen necessary to run these
cars.


   sound too good to be true? considering that it was developed by
a few scientists and engineers working for next to nothing in a
little canadian town, such an energy source does seem almost
unbelievable.


   which makes for a terrific book, written by journalist tom
koppel.


   ``the ballard fuel cell promises nothing less than to solve some
of the world's worst air pollution problems,'' he writes. ``yet, it
all began with a handful of people working on shoestring budgets
for a tiny canadian company, ballard power systems, in a
little-known city of north vancouver.''


   development and implementation of the ballard fuel cell is
discussed in koppel's book, ``powering the future: the ballard fuel
cell and the race to change the world'' (john wiley &amp; sons, 276
pages).


   geoffrey ballard, a citizen of canada and the united states
through his parents, did not set out to find an environmentally
friendly energy source, koppel writes. ballard became interested in
the idea when he was director of research for the newly formed
conservation office of the army during the energy crisis of 1973.


   ballard quickly realized that conservation was not a practical
means to solve air pollution problems or u.s. dependence on foreign
oil. instead, a cleaner energy source had to be discovered, he
decided.


   so ballard quit his well-paid job to start a company to create
such an energy source. tight money forced ballard and his wife and
children to start a restaurant to finance his dream, koppel writes
as he deftly chronicles the ups and downs of such an
entrepreneurial effort.


   ``in short, taking the ballard fuel cell to where it is today
took inspiration, perspiration, and a heavy dose of serendipity,''
he writes.


   interestingly, as the company began to succeed, so did its
stock. now 35 percent owned by daimlerchrysler and ford, ballard
power systems stock is up tenfold in the past three years. daimler
and ballard also agreed to create a separate company called ballard
automotive that would be owned jointly and would market the fuel
cells and fuel cell engines made by dbb.


   although ballard is a millionaire several times over, money may
be the least of his interests.


   as he told students graduating from the university of victoria,
british columbia: ``do not be patient. all things to do not come to
those who wait. challenge the normal. question conventional wisdom.
... dare to be in a hurry to change things for the better.''


   ballard was in a hurry, and his urgency may help us all breathe
a little better.

"company plans fuel cells for the home by 2000 



   lathan, n.y. _ plug power llc says it has developed a cleaner,
cheaper and more reliable way of getting electricity into the
average home.


   plug power announced it expects to bring a $3,000
dishwasher-sized power source that can supply all the electricity
needed to run the average home by 2000.


   environmentalists and government energy-policy architects
attending wednesday's announcement agreed the fuel-cell technology
is a good idea. they like the way fuel cells can produce
electricity in a clean, contained process that doesn't generate air
pollution the way coal-fired plants do, and that is also more
efficient in generating power.


   ``we are very interested in promoting this technology not only
to consumers, but to municipalities around the state,'' said daniel
r. mackay, representative of the new york conservation education
fund.


   the idea behind fuel-cell technology is to take a common fuel,
such as natural gas or propane and convert that into hydrogen gas.
early models are starting with hydrogen gas.


   hydrogen molecules are actually split into electrons and
protons, with the electrons providing the power that can be
converted into electricity for the home. the protons left over
react with oxygen in the air and create water, which is emitted
from the fuel cell as exhaust. thin membranes are used as a sort of
staging for the whole process.


   ``it never stops to boggle my mind that a little saran wrap-type
material can give you 300 to 400 amps of power, and your average
toaster uses 15 amps of power,'' said william ernst, vice president
and technical director of the latham, n.y.-based plug power.


   fuel cells are manufactured to match the specific energy needs
of different categories of consumers. plug power's first product
will produce 7,000 watts of power, more than enough to handle the
energy demands of a 2,000 square-foot home, according to the
company.


   already, a modest brick-faced ranch belonging to a company
employee is using a demonstration model fuel cell now.


   company employees admitted visitors to the home wednesday to
show how computers, televisions, kitchen appliances, lights and air
conditioners can all be powered at the same time from the fuel
cell.


   because the electricity is actually produced right on the home
site with a delivered fuel such as natural gas or propane from a
home tank, it doesn't have to be transmitted through power lines
and poles that can be felled in storms.


   plug power said the power produced by a fuel cell could be 20
percent cheaper than that provided by major utility companies.


   in addition, heat expended by the fuel cell can be used to heat
water in the home.


   plug power president gary mittleman said he expected utility
companies to distribute the systems to residential customers when
the first product, the plug power 7000, comes onto the market in
2000.


   utility companies may own the product, install it on customer
premises and charge for the electricity produced, he said. as the
market evolves, customers might buy their own models, perhaps even
from appliance dealers.


   other companies also are trying to produce this technology and
to get into related markets. some companies, for instance, are
focused solely on fuel cells for cars.


   connecticut-based onsi corp. produces fuel cells for commercial
buildings that require more power.


   ge power systems distributes power-generation units for small
industrial units, and so goes after a different segment of the
power market, according to a spokeswoman.


   so far, plug power is well-positioned to be the leader in the
u.s. residential market, said jean m. redfield, president of dte
edison electric, which is one of plug power's two corporate
parents.


   plug power also has its eye on markets in china, latin america
and other countries where some regions lack extensive power-grid
systems, executives said, as well as industrialized nations that
are grappling with air-pollution problems.


   plug power is a joint vent"

 princeton researches fusion energy 


	plainsboro, n.j. (ap) -- scientists using the country's newest  
experimental nuclear reactor believe they're gaining ground in 
their efforts to develop a safe and inexhaustible power source for 
the next century -- fusion energy. 


	the national spherical torus experiment, or nstx, at the  
princeton university plasma physics laboratory in this central new 
jersey suburb already is impressing both officials supporting 
fusion research funding and the physicists and engineers working on 
the nationwide collaboration. 


	``the nstx is an enormous example of the potential'' of the  
technology, energy secretary bill richardson said recently. ``it 
brings us closer to the reality of fusion energy.'' 


	fusion, the process that powers the sun, involves slamming  
special forms of tiny hydrogen atoms together at very high 
temperature and pressure in a plasma, a hot mass of electrically 
charged gas similar to the substance inside a fluorescent light 
bulb. 


	proponents say harnessing the power released when the atoms fuse  
will one day provide a clean energy source far safer than today's 
commercial nuclear fission reactors, which split apart large, 
radioactive atoms. the fuel, hydrogen atoms removed from water, is 
plentiful. in addition, the fusion process can't cause a 
``meltdown'' reaction and doesn't contribute to air pollution, acid 
rain or the greenhouse effect. 


	laboratory director robert j. goldston said the radioactivity  
produced by a fusion reactor is 100,000 times less than in an 
equivalent fission reactor. 


	fossil fuel supplies are expected to run low in 50 years, and  
many scientists hope fusion will be a major energy source before 
then. 


	``in the year 2100, either we're going to be real toasty and  
under water (from flooding induced by global warming), or we're 
going to have a completely different energy system,'' goldston 
said. 


	but perfecting the technology to control a self-sustaining  
``burn'' of nuclear fuel will take decades and cost hundreds of 
millions of dollars. meanwhile, physicists across the country say 
progress has been slowed in recent years by the federal 
government's inadequate financial commitment: just $27 million 
annually for the nstx project and $227 million a year for the 
country's entire fusion research program. 


	``magnetic fusion research is eminently worthwhile because it  
solves an energy problem,'' yet it's not a high priority for the 
government, said patrick diamond, a university of california-san 
diego physics professor whose research focuses on turbulence in 
reactor plasmas. 


	limiting that turbulence, which quickly cools down the  
multimillion-degree plasma and stops the fusion process, is one of 
the biggest challenges to physicists and a major focus of the nstx 
team. 


	diamond and his princeton colleagues are particularly worried  
that, under pressure from congress, the administration has reduced 
participation in a planned international collaboration on the next 
generation of reactor to basically consulting with scientists in 
russia, japan and a european consortium. 


	the only u.s. facility for the project was shut last year and  
there is no funding for the collaboration in the proposed budget 
for fiscal year 2000. 


	the physicists worry this country could end up paying for rights  
to use the technology, rather than being able to sell it to 
less-developed nations. 


	given washington's push for smaller, cheaper reactors, the  
compact nstx is particularly attractive, compared to the 
gymnasium-sized fusion reactor it replaced here, goldston said. 


	the tokamak fusion test reactor was shut down two years ago  
after 15 years of breakthrough experiments that included producing 
a record-setting 10.7 million watts of power, about 100 million 
times the level reactors were able to generate in the 1970s. 


	but the tokamak reactor would cost nearly 15 times as much to  
build today as the $24 million nstx, which uses much of the same 
peripheral equ"

"quest to tame energy of stars revives 



   plainsboro, n.j. _ in its heyday it was a palace among physics
laboratories, with an enviably fat budget, ample support staff and
the prestige that comes to research institutions working at the
cutting edge in solving global problems. but today, the princeton
plasma physics laboratory, still a leader in hydrogen fusion
research, is so short of cash that it can no longer afford even a
receptionist.


   however, a dry spell of discouragements and spending cuts for
fusion research may be ending. with their backs to a financial
wall, specialists in the field are banding together to pursue the
elusive goal of harnessing thermonuclear fusion, the process that
drives the sun and hydrogen bombs.


   leaders in the field say the new spirit calls for lean,
selective financing of small-scale experiments as well as the large
ones that have dominated the field's history, increased cooperation
between long-standing competitors, and a lot of patience.


   proponents of hydrogen fusion, the joining together of hydrogen
nuclei to produce useful energy, have suffered too many
frustrations over the years to hope for too much too soon. fusion
energy will not come tomorrow. but it could become a reality in the
mid-21st century, believers say, and slow the carbon dioxide
pollution of the atmosphere by the burning of fossil fuels _ a
problem that may be leading to disastrous global warming.


   pressed by tight budgetary constraints imposed by congress,
competing fusion laboratories have begun sharing and coordinating
their research to a greater extent than ever and have drafted
guidelines for allocating their limited resources as they would an
investment portfolio, giving major financing to the most promising
projects but gambling some funds for high-risk but potentially
fruitful experiments.


   next month fusion scientists and engineers from around the world
will hold a meeting in snowmass, colo., to discuss all the devices
and proposals currently on the table. it will be the first meeting
of its kind, according to its co-chairman, dr. michael e. mauel of
columbia university, and it signals a growing realization that if
fusion energy is ever to become a reality it will require global
cooperation rather than endless competition between nations and
individual laboratories.


   the main obstacle to accelerated research fusion, many
scientists say, is the disincentive created by low fossil fuel
prices.


   ``right now,'' said dr. robert j. goldston, director of the
princeton plasma physics laboratory in new jersey, ``a bottle of
table water costs more than a bottle of gasoline. but cheap oil
won't last forever, and in any case, the burning of fossil fuels
may be contributing to global warming. fusion, which could produce
enormous amounts of energy at reasonable cost with only negligible
amounts of radioactive waste and no pollution of the atmosphere,
may be our only practical alternative to fossil fuels.''


   no one doubts that hydrogen fusion can be achieved. huge pulses
of fusion power have already been generated by experimental fusion
reactors in the united states and europe. the trouble is that until
now, conventional generating plants have had to supply more energy
to kindle a thermonuclear pulse than the pulse itself produces.


   no one has yet been able to squeeze thermonuclear fuel tightly
enough and long enough to ignite a self-sustaining fusion reaction.


   in the sun, energy is produced when hydrogen nuclei fuse to
produce helium, a heavier element. but for hydrogen nuclei to
overcome their mutual electrostatic repulsion and get close enough
to fuse, they must have very high velocities, that is to say, they
must be very, very hot.


   scores of different reactor designs have been built, tested and
abandoned over the years, most of which belong to one of two main
categories: magnetic confinement, the squeezing of plasma by
magnetic fields; and inertial confinement, the squeezing of hot gas
by the implosion of miniature hydrogen bombs.

 cuba looks to hydrogen fuel research 


havana, april 23 (xinhua) -- cuban authorities have formed a
special group to stimulate research on the use of hydrogen as
fuel that could be used in place of petroleum in the next century.


hydrogen is the most abundant element on the planet and its
combustion does not contaminate the atmosphere since it only
produces steam, dr. vito quevedo, the chief of the national
program for the development of sustainable energy sources, said
today.


the group for studying hydrogen as a renewable energy source
will collate all the work being done in the country to speed up
research, he added.


during the first stage of research, the group will seek all the
information available worldwide on the practical uses of hydrogen.

"systems designed to hold a homemade sun 



   scientists have developed a variety of devices and systems in
which they hope to be able to compress hydrogen to the densities
and temperatures needed to sustain thermonuclear fusion reactions.
among them are these: &ql;


   tokamaks


   tokamaks, reactors that are shaped like doughnuts and occupy
large buildings, are chambers from which air has been removed and
into which is injected a diffuse plasma of hydrogen isotopes,
especially mixtures of deuterium and tritium. the plasma, a hot,
electrically charged gas, is compressed within the doughnut by two
sets of magnetic fields, one in which the magnetic field circles
the doughnut the long way around and the other in which the
magnetic field lines run the short way around the doughnut tube.


   by varying the geometry and strength of the fields, they can be
adjusted to produce a uniform compressive force on the plasma. but
even with uniform compression, turbulence and instabilities develop
in a tokamak's plasma, cooling it and enormously complicating the
goal of achieving sustained fusion.


   to ignite fusion, the compressed plasma in a tokamak must be
raised to the temperature of the sun, and various strategies have
been developed for this. part of the necessary heating is achieved
simply by compressing the plasma. another technique involves
passing an electric current through the plasma, thus heating it in
the same way electricity heats a toaster wire.


   heating can also be achieved by ducting microwave energy into
the plasma, and another technique heats the plasma by shooting
beams of neutral particles into it from an accelerator. once fusion
is initiated, helium ions (also called alpha particles) produced by
the fusion of hydrogen nuclei transfer their energy to the plasma
and help to heat it.


   dozens of tokamaks have been built and tested in many countries.
although the united states withdrew from a project called the
international thermonuclear experimental reactor _ a huge tokamak
the planning for which has already consumed $1 billion _ russia,
europe and japan are continuing some work on the machine. but
prospects for financing the project to completion seem bleak.


   meanwhile, the largest existing tokamaks continue to produce
impressive fusion pulses. the joint european torus in england
achieved a record for fusion power in a burst of 20 million watts. &ql;


   spherical torus machines


   these are similar to tokamaks, in that they compress plasma fuel
within toruses using interlocking magnetic fields. but they have
much thinner cores than ordinary tokamaks, giving them a shape more
similar to that of an apple than a doughnut. their more or less
spherical shape permits more efficient compression of plasma than
can be achieved in a conventional tokamak.


   a small spherical torus built and tested in britain has already
proved to have a very high ratio of plasma compression to magnetic
field strength. improving this ratio is a major goal of all
magnetic confinement fusion devices.


   the princeton plasma physics laboratory has built a somewhat
larger spherical torus reactor that is scheduled to begin an
experimental program in august. scientists believe that this type
of reactor, with a tight magnetic field passing through its core,
may be able to compress plasma and reach fusion conditions more
cheaply than is possible with conventional tokamaks.


   princeton's national spherical torus experiment will not achieve
fusion, but it will allow operators to experiment with a wide
variety of conditions. &ql;


   stellarators


   like tokamaks, these are more or less doughnut shaped, but their
magnetic fields are designed to shape the compressed plasma into a
warped helix with many kinks. unlike a tokamak, a stellarator need
not be perfectly symmetrical. its configuration is believed to
control plasma turbulence more efficiently than does a tokamak. oak
ridge national laboratory and the princeton laboratory hope to get
federal financing next year to build a small stellarator of
advanced design. &ql"

jet broke the world record for power fusion on october 31, by

it also broke the world record for the ratio of fusion power
produced to the net input power with 0.65 in the same experiment.


"almost the same results were obtained twice within two hours,
that means the experiment can be repeated," he added.


the former record was created by jet on september 22 when
output power peaked at 12.9 megawatts and the ratio of fusion
power produced to the net input power was 0.6.


if the ratio is above 1, the fusion will not only be maintained
by the energy it releases, but also output net energy.


in november 1991, for the first time, controlled fusion power
was produced by jet with output power peaking at 1.7 megawatts. in
november, 1994, the u.s. tokamak fusion test reactor has produced
10.7 megawatts of fusion power at a ratio of 0.28.


jet, based at abingdon, oxfordshire, britain, is seen as the
largest and most successful fusion experiment in the
world. construction began in 1978 and the project has been

"inventor's device may cut auto emissions 



   it's no bigger than a beer mug, but the simple device developed
in daniel cohn's lab at the massachusetts institute of technology
has the potential to make significant reductions in the already
drastically-improved emissions from ordinary cars.


   cohn, who has been working on the concept since 1993, last month
won an innovation award from discover magazine for the patented
device, which cleans up emissions by producing pure hydrogen that
is added to the engine's fuel mixture. this allows the engine to
burn cooler and leaner (that is, with more air in the mix).


   the device is quite simple: fuel enters a chamber, mixes with
air, and then is zapped with electricity. that creates a plasma _
an electrically-charged gas _ which then causes carbon from the
fuel to join with oxygen from the air. this leaves a mixture of
carbon monoxide and hydrogen, both of which can be burned up by the
engine.


   ``it's well known that hydrogen improves the environmental
qualities'' of a conventional engine, said cohn, who is director of
mit's plasma science and fusion center. the hard part has always
been producing the hydrogen.


   although the first tests of the device connected to a
conventional engine are just beginning at the us department of
energy's oak ridge national laboratory, calculations based on lab
tests of the device by itself show that it should reduce nitrogen
oxide emissions _ a major component of smog _ by 90 percent. ``a
number of major car companies have talked to us,'' he said, ``both
us and foreign.'' but he said it would not be appropriate to name
the companies at this early stage of discussions.


   ``the principle of what he's talking about is sound and
attractive,'' said daniel sperling, director of the center for
advanced automotive research at the university of california at
davis. but, he said, there are some unanswered questions, such as:
how cheaply can it be manufactured, and what kind of maintenance
issues might it encounter?


   but an even bigger question, sperling said, is how much need
there is for such a device in the first place. since new cars _ and
especially the newer cars coming in the next few years _ are
already vastly cleaner than their predecessors, ``the demand for a
device of this kind is not nearly as great as 10 years ago.''


   the progress _ which sperling attributes in large part to strict
regulations such as california's air-quality rules _ has been far
greater than virtually anyone expected. ``the new cars, for all
practical purposes, are zero-emitting,'' he said. ``it's
extraordinary what they've done.''


   cohn agrees that the new cars are much cleaner, but points out
that the major companies are still spending hundreds of millions of
dollars in a quest for even cleaner cars. also, some trucks and
buses _ where much greater improvements are needed because their
larger engines produce more emissions _ run on conventional
spark-ignition engines, and thus could use the new device.


   besides offering cleaner emissions during ordinary operation,
said cohn, with his device the engine can be set to run on
virtually pure hydrogen during startup _ the period when the
greatest emission of pollutants usually occurs, because the car's
catalytic converter has not yet warmed up to its operating
temperature. those startup emissions would be drastically reduced
by such a system, he said. already, volvo has been working on a
different technique for providing pure hydrogen to the engine
during this startup period.


   ``this device could greatly reduce air pollution from cars,
trucks, and buses, using present internal combustion technology,
without a major increase in costs and without any inconvenience to
the driver,'' cohn said.


   but that's just one of the potential benefits of the device,
cohn said in an interview. dubbed the ``microplasmatron,'' it could
also allow a variety of unconventional or unrefined fuels _
including natural gas, diesel, and even ordinary vegetable oil _ to
be used in car engines. that's because it is es"

"world moving slowly toward energy free of carbon 



   even as the world's expanding population and economy increase
atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide that scientists say
are warming the earth, the global energy system is moving steadily
away from the carbon-rich fuels whose combustion produces the gas.


   experts say that atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide may be
double those of the pre-industrial era by the end of the next
century. but they also say the levels would be much higher except
for a trend toward lower-carbon fuels that has been going on for
more than 100 years, but has been largely unnoticed except by a
small band of energy specialists.


   the question now, they say, is whether the trend can be
accelerated enough to stave off or lessen what many scientists
believe is a potentially disruptive global warming.


   for nearly a century and a half, fuels with high amounts of
carbon have progressively been replaced by those containing less.
first wood, which is high in carbon, was eclipsed in the late 19th
century by coal, which contains less. then oil, with a lower carbon
content still, dethroned king coal in the 1960s.


   now analysts say that natural gas, lighter still in carbon, may
be entering its heyday, and that the day of hydrogen _ providing a
fuel with no carbon at all, by definition _ may at last be about to
dawn.


   as a result, the experts estimate, the world's economy today
burns less than two-thirds as much carbon per unit of energy
produced as it did in 1860. in the united states, they estimate,
the trend toward lower-carbon fuels combined with greater energy
efficiency has, since 1950, reduced by about half the amount of
carbon spewed out for each unit of economic production.


   but because economic growth and population growth have been so
rapid over the decades, overall atmospheric concentrations of
carbon dioxide have steadily risen, to the point that the
concentrations may well have doubled by the year 2100. mainstream
scientists say that this much carbon dioxide could warm the earth,
on average, by 3 to 5 degrees fahrenheit. by comparison, that is
about half as much as it has warmed since the depths of the last
ice age 18,000 to 20,000 years ago. a change of this magnitude
would likely have widespread consequences for the world's climate,
weather and human life.


   now, as representatives of 150 governments meet in bonn,
germany, in the latest round of global talks on measures to further
reduce carbon-dioxide emissions, analysts both in and out of
industry say that the next quarter-century is shaping up as a
period of technological and economic ferment offering a chance to
accelerate the trend toward a low-carbon economy and, eventually, a
no-carbon one.


   in bonn, the delegates are trying to work out the details of an
agreement forged two years ago in kyoto, japan, that could speed up
the trend. their work is not expected to be finished for at least a
year, and the kyoto agreement still must be ratified by a
sufficient number of countries after that.


   however that may turn out, ``the decarbonization of the energy
system is the single most important fact to emerge from the last 20
years of analysis'' of the system, said dr. jesse ausubel, an
expert on energy and climate at rockefeller university in new york
city. he predicts that this evolution will produce a carbon-free
energy system by the end of the 21st century.


   among some recent signs of the trend are these:


   _ the federal energy information administration reported last
week that emissions of carbon dioxide by the united states had
increased by an average of 1.37 percent a year in the 1990s _ only
about half the 2.6-percent rate of growth in economic production.
analysts say the discrepancy is evidence that the economy is being
decoupled from carbon.


   _ the agency reported this month that the same is generally true
in china, the biggest consumer and producer of coal in the world,
where coal production has been reported to be dropping lately.
``china has dispelled a commonly held notion th"
