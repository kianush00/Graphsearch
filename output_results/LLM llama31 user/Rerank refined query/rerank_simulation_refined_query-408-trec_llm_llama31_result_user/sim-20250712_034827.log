DEBUG:simuser.search.interfaces.pyterrier:raw text: 1999-04-02 05:14:41   usa   Deadly Hurricane Season Predicted  Tropical storms and hurricanes killed thousands last year, and a top forecaster says the 1999 Atlantic  hurricane season could be just as deadly.  ``The odds strongly favor us entering a new era for storms,''   William Gray, a Colorado State University weather forecaster, said  Thursday at the National Hurricane Conference.  Gray predicted the Atlantic hurricane season this year could   match the 14 tropical storms and 10 hurricanes that killed at least  10,000 people last year, mostly by Hurricane Mitch in Honduras.  Cyclical changes making Atlantic waters warmer and saltier are   behind the upswing in storm activity, Gray said. The same  conditions have not been seen since the late 1960s.  The 1999 season will have 14 named storms and nine hurricanes,   four of them major, Gray predicted. ``That's a very active  season,'' he said.  Florida could experience severe damage sometime in the near   future because of the upswing in the number of storms and because  more people are living in storm-prone areas.  ``We're going to be seeing a $50 billion-, $70 billion-, $100   billion-damage storm,'' Gray said. ``Florida is a sitting duck.''  Over the last 30 years, an average of about 10 tropical storms   have occurred annually, and five or six have reached hurricane  strength.  The hurricane season begins June 1 and lasts through Nov. 30.   Gov. Jeb Bush said at the conference that he would work to   improve hurricane evacuation routes and maintain tougher building  codes.  ``We have a responsibility to make sure people can escape when   they are asked to do so,'' he said.  Tropical storm and hurricane names selected for 1999 for the   Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico and Carribean are Arlene, Bret, Cindy,  Dennis, Emily, Floyd, Gert, Harvey, Irene, Jose, Katrina, Lenny,  Maria, Nate, Ophelia, Philippe, Rita, Stan, Tammy, Vince and Wilma.

The 1999 season will have 14 named storms and nine hurricanes,   four of them major, predicted Colorado State weather forecaster  William Gray.  ``That's a very active season,'' said Gray, who was taking part   in the three-day National Hurricane Conference.  Last season, there were 14 tropical storms, including 10   hurricanes. The hurricane death toll in 1998 was at least 10,000,  mostly from Hurricane Mitch's damage in Honduras.  The hurricane season begins June 1 and lasts through Nov. 30.   Over the last 30 years, an average of about 10 tropical storms   have occurred annually, and five or six have reached hurricane  strength.

These cyclical  conditions haven't been seen since the late 1960s.  ``The odds strongly favor us entering a new era for storms,''   Gray said.  Despite the devastation wreaked by Hurricane Andrew in 1992,   Florida has been lucky during the past 25 years in that the state  has seen fewer than usual hurricanes, Gray said.  He said Florida could see more damage in the near future because   of the upswing in the number of storms and because more people are  living in storm-prone areas.  ``We're going to be seeing a $50 billion-, $70 billion-, $100   billion- damage storm,'' Gray said. ``Florida is a sitting duck.''

DEBUG:simuser.search.interfaces.pyterrier:raw text: FROM ARLENE TO ZELDA  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   FROM THE FORT WORTH STAR-TELEGRAM    What is a hurricane?    A hurricane is an intense tropical storm that has winds of 74 mph and higher, according to the National Hurricane Center.    These winds blow in a large spiral around a calm center, called the ``eye.'' The eye is 20-30 miles wide. In the Northern Hemisphere of the Earth, winds move counterclockwise around the eye. In the Southern Hemisphere, winds circulate clockwise.    Hurricanes develop over tropical ocean waters and many remain there. When a hurricane does approach land, skies begin to darken and winds strengthen. The hurricane begins driving water ahead of it in a storm surge or tidal wave that can be 20 feet at its peak. Hurricanes can also trigger tornadoes and floods.    How are hurricanes named?    The World Meteorological Organization has chosen an alphabetical list of names for tropical storms and hurricanes, and the list rotates every six years. That practice started in 1953. Names used for storms this year are the same that were used in 1993.    The names of tropical storms and hurricanes used to be all women's names until 1978 and '79. Now, men's names are alternated with women's.    Sometimes, when a hurricane is particularly destructive, the name is retired, which means the name can't be used for at least 10 years.    One such name was Hurricane Andrew, which struck Florida and Louisiana in 1992. The storm caused 54 deaths and up to $30 billion in damage.    To put that in context, the Galveston, Texas hurricane of 1900 (before hurricanes were named) caused 6,000 deaths, the most in U.S. history, according to the World Almanac and Book of Facts.    Where and when are most hurricanes in the United States?    Florida has the most hurricanes in the United States, the National Hurricane Center reports.    Other places vulnerable to hurricanes are the coasts along the Gulf of Mexico and the North Atlantic Ocean, from Texas to Maine.    The hurricane season is from June 1 to Nov. 30, and peak months are August and September.    Which hurricanes and tropical storms have formed in the Atlantic Ocean this year?    Arlene: This tropical storm formed on June 11 and spent its life at sea in the central Atlantic. Winds reached 65 mph.    Bret: This hurricane struck the Texas coast near Corpus Christi and Brownsville on Aug. 22. It had winds of 125 mph.    Cindy: This hurricane formed near the Cape Verde Islands west of the African country of Senegal but did not come ashore. On Aug. 28, it reached its peak intensity of 140 mph.    Dennis: This storm formed on Aug. 23, became a hurricane on Aug. 26 and reached 105 mph on Aug. 28. It moved up the southeast U.S. coast and struck the North Carolina coast on Aug. 30.    Emily: This tropical storm formed on Aug. 24 and reached wind speeds of 65 mph.    Floyd: This storm was upgraded to a hurricane on Sept. 10, reaching peak winds of 155 mph. Blowing from the Bahamas to the Carolinas to New England, it caused 60 deaths, immense flooding of roads and buildings, and mass road closures and power outages. Walt Disney World was closed for bad weather for the first time in its history.    Gert: Winds from this storm reached 130 to 145 mph on Sept. 17 and caused damage to structures and beaches in Bermuda. The hurricane weakened to a tropical storm on Sept. 23.    Harvey: This tropical storm formed in the Gulf of Mexico on Sept. 19 and dumped 10 inches of rain on south Florida.    What are this year's names for hurricanes?

(AP) - As Tropical Storm Gordon threatened to become a hurricane and strike Florida's Gulf Coast, Gov. Jeb Bush on Saturday activated emergency response teams.    State officials said they expect Gordon to be a Category 1 hurricane with winds of between 74 and 95 mph when it strikes land anywhere between Fort Myers and the Panhandle sometime late Sunday.    Rains of five inches or more are expected and coastal areas should anticipate a storm surge, said Joe Myers, the state emergency management director.    The National Hurricane Center issued a tropical storm warning Saturday that covered a 210-mile stretch from Bonita Beach just south of Fort Myers to the Suwanee River, about 100 miles north of Tampa.    Forecasters also issued a hurricane watch for a 400-mile stretch from Bonita Beach to the Panhandle town of Apalachicola. They said Gordon could reach hurricane strength by late Saturday.    A tropical storm warning means a storm with winds of between 39 and 73 mph is expected to hit an area within the next 24 hours. A hurricane watch means a storm with winds of 74 mph or greater could hit within the next 36 hours.    At 2 p.m. EDT, Gordon was located near latitude 24.1 north and longitude 86.1 west - about 345 miles southwest of Tampa. Its winds have increased from 65 to 70 mph, 4 mph below hurricane strength.    Two to five inches of rain are expected across portions of South Florida and the Keys on Saturday, forecasters said.    Saturday afternoon, counties along central Florida's Gulf Coast began recommending voluntary evacuation for residents in barrier islands and coastal or low lying areas.    Disaster officials in Hernando, Manatee and Pinellas counties told residents they should start packing, and that shelters would be opened Saturday evening. Other counties were awaiting later forecasts before deciding whether of advise their residents to evacuate.    The storm is even causing some concern on Florida's Atlantic coast - at Cape Canaveral, NASA considered Saturday moving space shuttle Discovery off its seaside launch pad and into it's hangar. Discovery is scheduled to blast off on a space-station construction mission on Oct. 5.    Gordon's affect is already being felt in Cuba and Mexico.    Heavy rains of seven to 10 inches affected parts of western Cuba early Saturday, and heavy rains were reported Friday on Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. That caused street flooding in the resort city of Cancun.    Meanwhile, tropical storm force winds struck Bermuda on Saturday as Hurricane Florence passed to the island nation's north, but the storm is not expected to score a direct hit.    Winds of 60 mph hit Bermuda early Saturday, but no damage was reported, the National Hurricane Center said.    At 10 a.m. EDT, Florence was 180 miles north of Bermuda and was moving to the northeast at 25 mph. Near its center, it still packed hurricane force winds of 75 mph, but those missed the island, forecasters said.    ''There was no structural damage. There was no flooding,'' said James Buxton, meteorologist with the Bermuda Weather Service. ''For a few hours, winds reached tropical storm force.''    Rip currents associated with Florence were blamed for at least three surf deaths Tuesday in North Carolina.    Meanwhile, a tropical depression that was sighted in the tropics early Saturday has been downgraded to a tropical wave because hurricane hunters could find no clear center of circulation.    However, the wave is still carrying 35 mph winds and gusts to tropical storm force in squalls are likely over parts of the Leewards later Saturday.    At 1 p.m. EDT, the wave was located about 230 miles east of Guadeloupe in the Leeward Islands and was moving west near 17 mph.    A tropical storm watch has been discontinued for the Leeward Islands.    On the Net:    National Hurricane Center: http://www.nhc.noaa.gov  AP-ES-09-16-00 1450

At 5 a.m. EDT, Hurricane Gert was 395 miles southeast of Bermuda   and moving to the northwest at nearly 13 mph. Its top sustained  winds had slowed slightly to 125 mph, but Bermuda remained under a  hurricane watch issued by the National Hurricane Center in Miami.  The storm was expected to make a gradual turn to the north, but   Bermuda residents began heading to grocery stores for supplies  Sunday.  ``It's a threat to Bermuda ... it's a strong storm,'' said   public safety minister Paula Cox.  The last time Bermuda suffered major damage from a hurricane was   in 1987, when Hurricane Emily hit the island, moved offshore, then  struck again.  By early today, the tropical depression circulating in the Gulf   of Mexico had become Tropical Storm Harvey, with top sustained  winds of nearly 45 mph.  A tropical storm watch was issued for much of Florida's western   coast, from the Suwanee River north of Cedar Key to Bonita Springs  north of Naples.  At 5 a.m. EDT, Harvey was 305 miles southwest of St. Petersburg   and not moving much. The storm was expected to pick up speed as it  moves to the northeast and forecasters warned that it could bring  several inches of rain to central Florida by Tuesday.  Harvey could come ashore north of Tampa, cross Florida on   Tuesday, then shoot into the Atlantic with 60 mph winds, hurricane  specialist Brian Jarvinen said.  In the Pacific, Hurricane Hilary made its debut Sunday off the   coast of Mexico but was expected to weaken. It was more than 200  miles southwest of Baja California, traveling to the northwest at  about 12 mph.

SCHMID, Associated Press Writer    WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hurricane season is fast approaching and the outlook isn't pretty.    Federal storm specialists predicted an above-average storm season Wednesday, calling for stronger, longer-lasting storms this year, and more of them.    Hurricane season officially begins June 1, and the outlook is for 11 tropical storms, seven of which will be hurricanes, three of them major.    ''This puts coastal areas and the Caribbean islands at a much higher risk of experiencing a tropical storm or hurricane,'' said D. James Baker, head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.    The forecast is similar to last year's, which was followed by a series of serious storms, including Hurricane Floyd, that caused massive evacuations along the Southeastern coast and then inundated North Carolina.    The La Nina cooling of water in the Pacific Ocean, the same condition that influenced the 1999 season, remains in place, Baker said.    ''For this reason we expect we'll have another major economic impact on the United States,'' he said.    ''It's not just about the number'' of storms, added Max Mayfield, director of the National Hurricane Center in Miami. ''What really counts is where they make landfall and how strong they are. Just one hurricane over your community makes it a very bad year.''    James Lee Witt, director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, stressed the importance of having a plan and being prepared for the storms. He cited community efforts, including Project Impact, which helps people strengthen their homes against storms of all types.    A poll the agency released Wednesday revealed that more than half of people vulnerable to hurricane damage don't prepare adequately because they underestimate their risk. Poll takers also concluded that many do little to protect their homes because they think the cost is much higher than it actually is. One-third of the homeowners do not have an evacuation plan.    More than 1,200 people from Massachusettes to Texas were questioned for the poll in April and May. The margin of error was plus or minus 3 percentage points.    Baker and Witt signed a memorandum pledging to work closely together to warn people of impending storms and help them prepare.    ''It doesn't matter how good the forecast is if people don't plan in advance,'' said Jack Kelly, director of the National Weather Service.    Last year's evacuations left thousands of people trapped on jammed highways for hours and the forecasters said that is a problem they hope to avoid in the future. Coastal areas subject to flooding need to be evacuated in storms, but not every place that merely expects wind damage, they said.    ''You flee from storm surge, you hide from wind,'' said Mayfield, calling on people to get storm shutters, build safe rooms and take other steps to prepare their homes.    The new outlook from the government forecasters echoes that of Bill Gray of Colorado State University, one of the few willing to make long-range storm predictions. For this season he also predicted 11 named storms.    Mayfield was picked last week to replace the retired Jerry Jarrell as director of the hurricane center.    Also last week a new weather satellite was launched that can be pressed into service this summer if needed. The $220 million GOES-L satellite had been delayed a year.    The forecasters rely on two Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites to monitor tropical storms and other severe weather. The East Coast's GOES-8, however, is a year beyond its design lifetime. Although still working, it could break down at any moment. GOES-L is a crucial backup.    While some climate experts have been blaming the increase in tropical storms in recent years on global warming, Gray says the trend is cyclical and not related to warming.    Asked about this Wednesday, Baker agreed. ''We don't see, at this point, a link between global warming and tropic

DEBUG:simuser.search.interfaces.pyterrier:raw text: HURRICANE FORECASTER PREDICTS ACTIVE STORM SEASON FOR '99  This year's hurricane season in the Atlantic is likely be ``very active'' with a chance of damaging storms striking Florida and the East Coast, a leading hurricane forecaster said Friday.    William Gray, an atmospheric scientist and hurricane expert at Colorado State University, predicted that in the hurricane year beginning June 1 there would be 14 tropical storms, with nine of them hurricanes.    Four of the hurricanes could be major, Category 3 or higher, meaning winds of at least 111 miles per hour on a scale of 1 to 5. Hurricanes have winds of at least 74 mph, and tropical storm warning are issued when winds reach 55 mph.    Gray discussed his forecast at the annual meeting of the National Hurricane Conference, an organization of hurricane experts.    Based on ``climate signals'' from stratospheric winds and warmer currents in the north Atlantic, Gray said the ``odds are'' that the 1999 hurricane season could look like that of last year, when there were 14 storms, 10 of them hurricanes, with three of them classified as major.    Gray said his hurricane-forecast record had been slightly better than a simple projection of climatological records since 1984.    From 1995 to 1998, there were 33 hurricanes, a record for a four-year period. That could signal a return to a cycle of high hurricane activity that lasts two or three decades, scientists at the meeting said. The last such cycle was seen in the 1940s and 1950s.    Gray also announced a new effort to estimate the sites where hurricanes would strike. His preliminary calculations show that Florida and the East Coast are 4.5 times more likely to get a major storm this year than in the 1970-1994 period. The odds of a major storm on the Gulf Coast are about the same as during that period, he said.    Christopher Landsea, a research meteorologist at the federal government's hurricane research division laboratory in Miami, said the 1970s and 1980s appeared to have been one of the periodic lulls.    ``We've been lucky,'' Landsea said. No major storm struck Florida from 1965 to 1992 when Hurricane Andrew caused $33 billion in damage. Since the 1960s, millions of people have moved to the Eastern coastline and built expensive homes, which will make storm damage much more costly, Landsea said.    In Southeast Florida, for example, the population of Dade and Broward counties has increased 600 percent between major storms. ``So it shouldn't come as a huge surprise that we have incredible damages now,'' Landsea said in an interview.    The possibility of more major storms striking the built-up coast ``scares me to death,'' said James Lee Witt, director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, who has been pushing pilot programs to hurricane-proof homes and remove as many as 500 homes from flood-prone areas. Hurricane damage in the United States last year totaled $7.3 billion.    (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)    The coastal situation is a ``time bomb,'' said Rade Musulin, a vice president of Farm Bureau insurance concern in Florida. Musulin said that many of the modern coastal houses were particularly vulnerable, built with large windows, vaulted ceilings and pools.    As the 1999 hurricane season approaches, experts are taking a number of initiatives to improve warnings to coastlines. The National Hurricane Center announced that it would issue gale warnings up to six hours earlier, or 24 hours, rather than the current 18.    Jerry Jarrell, the director of the center, also urged Florida to do something about ``the Key West problem,'' including the construction of a four-lane highway all the way from Key West. When Hurricane Georges, a Category II storm, struck last October, 30,000 people elected to stay on the Florida Keys. Computer models show that in a Category IV storm, Key West would be under water, Jarrell said. ``We would have massive casualties,'' he said.

The great storms from earlier this century are found only in fading snapshots, fading clippings, the fading memories of elderly survivors from a more sparsely developed Florida.    But if those storms were to strike today, they would hammer a Florida of 15 million people, gleaming megalopolises and coastlines packed shoulder-to-shoulder with luxury high-rises.    Adjusting for how Florida has changed, those storms would do damage on the order of Hurricane Andrew, an unnerving prospect for the future, hurricane researcher Christopher W. Landsea told the National Hurricane Conference on Friday.    Researchers studied the economic impact of the century's most ferocious storms as if they had hit the United States today. Adjusting for inflation, growth and increased property values, they found that seven of the 11 costliest storms and 13 of the top 30 were storms that hit Florida.    Topping the list: the great 1926 storm, which would cause an estimated $80 billion in damage today. It was almost as strong as Andrew and as big as Hugo. And unlike Andrew, which made landfall in Homestead, the 1926 hurricane hit downtown Miami head-on.    Andrew was second. It cost $26 billion when it hit in 1992. Just seven years later, its impact would be $36 billion, the study concluded.    The 1928 hurricane, which drowned up to 3,000 in the Glades, was ranked seventh, at $15 billion.    Meanwhile, Colorado State University hurricane soothsayer William Gray on Wednesday updated his annual forecast by saying he'll stick to his December prediction of 14 named storms _ tropical storms or hurricanes _ with nine of those becoming hurricanes, and four becoming major hurricanes, with winds of more than 111 mph. Gray never says where or whether storms will strike land, although he has said the odds of a hurricane hitting the U.S. East Coast, including all of Florida, is three times above normal this year.    Increasing awareness and preparation, better building codes and the advent of mass communications have dropped hurricane deaths from thousands per year at the turn of the century to 100 a year now, but property damages have risen sharply.    Despite that, people continue to migrate to America's coastline, especially Florida's, Landsea told weather researchers and emergency managers.    Applying his formula to history, Landsea contended the United States has a one-in-six chance of suffering a storm with more than $10 billion in damages, and every year, ``the stakes rise due to inexorable coastal population growth and development.''    Already about 110 million people _ nearly half of all Americans _ live in a 5-mile-wide coastal strip that accounts for only 10 percent of the nation's mass. It's expected to rise to three-fourths of Americans during the 21st century.    More people live in Miami-Dade and Broward counties, according to the 1990 census, than lived in all 109 coastal counties from Texas to Virginia in 1930, he said.    Major hurricanes make up only one-fifth of all tropical storms but account for 85 percent of the damage. And while peninsular Florida experienced seven major hurricanes from 1944 to 1950 and only three since, it is the increasingly-valuable property in their path that will mean more costly storms in the future, Landsea said.    ``We are causing hurricane disasters,'' he said. ``It is only a matter of time before the nation experiences a $50 billion or greater storm, with multibillion-dollar losses becoming more frequent.''    Landsea, a hurricane researcher at the South Florida-based Hurricane Research Division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, parent of the National Weather Service and the National Hurricane Center, conducted his research with Roger A.

The National Hurricane Center near Miami said a tropical storm warning for the region was appropriate because no hurricane-force winds were recorded anywhere in the three counties.    ``I can see why things are confusing to people,'' center director Jerry Jarrell said. ``We had a hurricane. There's no question about it. But you and I didn't get hurricane conditions. We got tropical storm conditions.''    Palm Beach County's emergency management director, Bill O'Brien, was more critical of himself than the hurricane center on Tuesday, saying his office opened shelters for people who didn't feel comfortable in their homes but in hindsight, should have encouraged mobile home evacuations.    ``I know those guys do the very best they can,'' O'Brien said of the hurricane center.    Jarrell said the storm's path shifted in those crucial hours on Friday because its eye reformed several times over land, each time moving to the east _ a phenomenon forecasters can't explain. He said such events occurred last year in several storms in the Gulf of Mexico, with the eye jumping as much as 75 miles over to the east. Jarrell said that's why tracking charts showed a steady track to the northeast even as the center continued to forecast a northern path.    ``If you're connecting the dots, it was'' heading north, Jarrell said. ``But if you're watching the eye, you're seeing it reform.''    Jarrell said that the strongest rains were farther east of center, and had the storm stayed on a path west of Lake Okeechobee, coastal Palm Beach County and the Treasure Coast would have received even more rain.    Jarrell also said a fire last month inside a weather computer in Maryland may have contributed to the less-than-exact forecast. The center made only two models a day instead of four, while other agencies' computers were available to do the other two models. Jarrell said that may have hampered the forecasting but it was early too say.    The center also suggested on Tuesday that employers consider sending employees home in a tropical storm warning instead of a hurricane warning.    ``It's just a meteorological distinction between 73 mph as a tropical storm and 74 mph as a hurricane,'' National Hurricane Center spokesman Frank Lepore said.    ``I guess that's natural,'' O'Brien said. ``People hear `hurricane' and they think anything from what we saw to Andrew. We have some strong storms on a routine basis in the summer that have tropical storm force winds.''    Gary Hines, senior vice president of the Business Development Board of Palm Beach County, said the idea of companies sending workers home in tropical storm warnings is ``worth the weather service presenting it to employers.''    Jarrell said the center doesn't want to get into the business of deciding when to open shelters, evacuate or order employees home.    ``Emergency management folks feel that is not our business,'' Jarrell said. ``We agree with that.''    Residents who suffered storm damage will base their insurance claims, and deductibles, on a hurricane strike, said Don Pride, spokesman for the Florida Department of Insurance.

Tropical Storm Gert was downgraded from a hurricane earlier   Thursday before it hit Canada's eastern coast with gale-force  winds. The boats were sunk and damaged in Newfoundland ports.  ``It was like something you watch in a horror movie,'' said   Albert Young, who watched a giant wave knock three men off the  wharf at St. Bride's, a tiny community on Newfoundland's Avalon  Peninsula.  One of the men was injured, said harbormaster Aloysius McGrath,   whose small office was leveled by water.  As the storm approached on Wednesday, some offshore oil rigs had   shut down, and evacuated nonessential staff to land.  Gert's outer bands were dropping light to moderately heavy   amounts of rain from Maine into eastern New Hampshire and  Massachusetts, and storm warnings remained in effect for coastal  Newfoundland.  The storm was moving northeast at about 30 mph, and was expected   to die out as it headed toward the north Atlantic, the U.S.  National Hurricane Center in Miami said.  Earlier in the week, the hurricane brushed Bermuda with the   outer edge of winds up to 110 mph, whipping up waves that smashed  seaside cottages and washed away prime stretches of beach.

(AP) - As Tropical Storm Gordon threatened to become a hurricane and strike Florida's Gulf Coast, Gov. Jeb Bush on Saturday activated emergency response teams.    State officials said they expect Gordon to be a Category 1 hurricane with winds of 74 to 95 mph when it strikes land anywhere between Fort Myers and the Panhandle sometime late Sunday.    Rains of five inches or more are expected and coastal areas could expect a storm surge, said Joe Myers, the state emergency management director.    The National Hurricane Center issued a tropical storm warning Saturday that covered a 210-mile stretch from Bonita Beach just south of Fort Myers to the Suwanee River, about 100 miles north of Tampa.    Forecasters also issued a hurricane watch for a 400-mile stretch from Bonita Beach to the Panhandle town of Apalachicola. They said Gordon could reach hurricane strength by late Saturday.    A tropical storm warning means a storm with winds of between 39 and 73 mph is expected to hit an area within the next 24 hours. A hurricane watch means a storm with winds of 74 mph or greater could hit within the next 36 hours.    At 10 a.m. EDT, Gordon was located about 355 miles southwest of Tampa, with winds of 65 mph, 9 mph below hurricane strength. Two to five inches of rain are expected across portions of South Florida and the Keys on Saturday, forecasters said.    Saturday afternoon, counties along central Florida's Gulf Coast began recommending voluntary evacuation for residents in barrier islands and coastal or low lying areas.    Disaster officials in Hernando, Manatee and Pinellas counties told residents they should start packing, and that shelters would be opened Saturday evening. Other counties were awaiting later forecasts before deciding whether of advise their residents to evacuate.    The storm is even causing some concern on Florida's Atlantic coast - at Cape Canaveral, NASA considered Saturday moving space shuttle Discovery off it's seaside launch pad and into it's hangar. Discovery is scheduled to blast off on a space-station construction mission on Oct. 5.    Gordon's affect is already being felt in Cuba and Mexico.    Heavy rains of seven to 10 inches affected parts of western Cuba early Saturday, and heavy rains were reported Friday on Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. That caused street flooding in the resort city of Cancun.    Meanwhile, tropical storm force winds struck Bermuda on Saturday as Hurricane Florence passed to the island nation's north, but the storm is not expected to score a direct hit.    Winds of 60 mph hit Bermuda early Saturday, but no damage was reported, the National Hurricane Center said.    At 7 a.m. EDT, Florence was 125 miles north of Bermuda and was moving to the northeast at 25 mph. Near its center, it still packed hurricane force winds of 75 mph, but those are expected to miss the island, forecasters said.    Rip currents associated with Florence were blamed for at least three surf deaths Tuesday in North Carolina.    Meanwhile, a third disturbance was sighted in the tropics.    A tropical depression with 35 mph winds was located about 260 miles east of Guadeloupe in the Leeward Islands and was moving west near 17 mph.    A tropical storm watch is in effect for the islands of Antigua, Anguilla, Barbuda, Montserrat, Nevis, St. Kitts, St. Maarten, Saba and St. Eustatius in the Leeward Islands.    Wind gusts to tropical storm force in squalls are likely over parts of the Leewards later Saturday.    On the Net:    National Hurricane Center: http://www.nhc.noaa.gov  AP-ES-09-16-00 1327

Eckels, also the county's director of emergency management, said 115-mph winds could be felt as far north as Conroe, Texas _ about 100 miles from the coast. The area surrounding the Clear Creek area of Houston, near the coast, would be under 22 feet of water, he added.    The estimates are part of a county study simulating what would happen if a category-five hurricane passed through Houston. No such hurricane has made landfall here.    ``It is a big concern that when a big hurricane comes toward this community, people will not take it seriously and will not understand the impact,'' Eckels said at the 2000 Houston/Galveston Hurricane Workshop in Pasadena, Texas.    Meanwhile, experts in Washington said Gulf Coast residents should brace for more hurricanes than the average season, possibly seven or more.    The average season brings 9.3 tropical storms, 5.8 of hurricane strength and 2.1 of intense hurricane strength.    Tropical storms form and receive names when their circulating winds reach 39 mph. They become hurricanes when their winds reach 74 mph and major hurricanes when winds reach 111 mph.    The hurricane season, which begins June 1 and ends Nov. 30, likely will bring stronger and longer-lasting storms than usual, including three or more ``major'' hurricanes with sustained winds over 110 mph, said scientists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.    ``It's not just about the number'' of storms, said Max Mayfield, director of NOAA's National Hurricane Center. ``What really counts is where they make landfall and how strong they are. Just one hurricane over your community makes it a very bad year.''    Last month, the Weather Research Center in Houston and hurricane expert William Gray at Colorado State University predicted a quiet season.    At the Pasadena workshop, experts addressed the possibility of a storm similar to the 1900 Galveston hurricane, which killed an estimated 8,000 people and remains the deadliest natural disaster in America.    Since that storm, Galveston has constructed a seawall and raised the grade of the island. &UR;    &LR; ``Think about all the people that have moved here,'' said Bill Read, meteorologist in charge at the Houston-Galveston National Weather Service. Read estimated as much as 30 percent of the Houston area's population did not live here when Hurricane Alicia made landfall in 1983.    Over the last decade, no hurricanes and only three tropical storms have affected the upper Texas coast. Many believe this relative quiet will cause people to become more relaxed in their hurricane preparations.    Chris Landsea, meteorologist at the NOAA's Hurricane Research Division, said in Pasadena that fault for much of the damage will fall on residents instead of Mother Nature.    ``I don't like to call it a natural disaster,'' Landsea said. ``We help make them.''    In Washington, NOAA officials expressed concern about a survey that shows people in hurricane-prone regions are largely ill-informed on the basics of hurricane preparation.    For example, most people do not know that flooding causes the majority of deaths during hurricanes and nearly half are unaware that homeowner's insurance does not cover flood damage, according to the May telephone survey of 1,037 people in several southern states, including Texas.

Since January 1, the Red Cross has responded to 239 disasters affecting 300,000 families in 41 states, Guam, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, serving 3.2 million meals and providing comfort to 200,000 people left homeless, it said. The organization spent 46 million dollars on disaster relief in 1997 and 71 million dollars in 1996. The Red Cross reported that it had spent more than 104 million dollars for recovery from September's Hurricane Georges, which damaged parts of the Florida Keys and then slammed into the Gulf Coast of Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama and north Florida. It spent 81.5 million dollars on Andrew, the second-most costly hurricane on record. The United States was struck by tornadoes and flooding in the first half of the year in many states in addition to Hurricane Georges. In February, massive flooding hit California and tornadoes struck Florida; in March, tornadoes swept southern Minnesota, Alabama and Georgia; in April and May, tornadoes brought disasters to Tennessee, Georgia, Alabama, Kentucky, Arkansas, North Carolina, South Dakota, Pennsylvania, New York, Minnesota and Wisconsin; while wildfires destroyed more than 200,000 hectares in Florida in June. In August, Hurricane Bonnie struck the coasts of North Carolina and Virginia, and Tropical Storm Charley touched down in Texas. In September, Tropical Storm Frances caused flooding in Louisiana and Texas. Florida was the state hit hardest by natural disasters in 1998 and the Red Cross set up 21 relief operations in the state, compared to Texas, which had 19; Georgia and New York had 14; and California had 13. The organization is continuing spending on relief for clean-up of damage from Georges in Puerto Rico; flood relief in Kansas and Texas; tornado relief in Oklahoma; and clean-up of damage from Hurricane Mitch, which struck the Florida Keys earlier this month.

SCHMID, Associated Press Writer    WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hurricane season is fast approaching and the outlook isn't pretty.    Federal storm specialists predicted an above-average storm season Wednesday, calling for stronger, longer-lasting storms this year, and more of them.    Hurricane season officially begins June 1, and the outlook is for 11 tropical storms, seven of which will be hurricanes, three of them major.    ''This puts coastal areas and the Caribbean islands at a much higher risk of experiencing a tropical storm or hurricane,'' said D. James Baker, head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.    The forecast is similar to last year's, which was followed by a series of serious storms, including Hurricane Floyd, that caused massive evacuations along the Southeastern coast and then inundated North Carolina.    The La Nina cooling of water in the Pacific Ocean, the same condition that influenced the 1999 season, remains in place, Baker said.    ''For this reason we expect we'll have another major economic impact on the United States,'' he said.    ''It's not just about the number'' of storms, added Max Mayfield, director of the National Hurricane Center in Miami. ''What really counts is where they make landfall and how strong they are. Just one hurricane over your community makes it a very bad year.''    James Lee Witt, director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, stressed the importance of having a plan and being prepared for the storms. He cited community efforts, including Project Impact, which helps people strengthen their homes against storms of all types.    Baker and Witt signed a memorandum pledging to work closely together to warn people of impending storms and help them prepare.    ''It doesn't matter how good the forecast is if people don't plan in advance,'' said Jack Kelly, director of the National Weather Service.    Last year's evacuations left thousands of people trapped on jammed highways for hours and the forecasters said that is a problem they hope to avoid in the future. Coastal areas subject to flooding need to be evacuated in storms, but not every place that merely expects wind damage, they said.    ''You flee from storm surge, you hide from wind,'' said Mayfield, calling on people to get storm shutters, build safe rooms and take other steps to prepare their homes.    The new outlook from the government forecasters echoes that of Bill Gray of Colorado State University, one of the few willing to make long-range storm predictions. For this season he also predicted 11 named storms.    Mayfield was picked last week to replace the retired Jerry Jarrell as director of the hurricane center.    Also last week a new weather satellite was launched that can be pressed into service this summer if needed. The $220 million GOES-L satellite had been delayed a year.    The forecasters rely on two Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites to monitor tropical storms and other severe weather. The East Coast's GOES-8, however, is a year beyond its design lifetime. Although still working, it could break down at any moment. GOES-L is a crucial backup.    While some climate experts have been blaming the increase in tropical storms in recent years on global warming, Gray says the trend is cyclical and not related to warming.    Asked about this Wednesday, Baker agreed. ''We don't see, at this point, a link between global warming and tropical cyclone activity,'' he said.    Tropical cyclones is another name for hurricanes, which are also called typhoons in some parts of the world.    Over the last three decades forecasters have gotten better at predicting where the storms will go, researchers Colin McAdie and Miles Lawrence report in the May issue of the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society.    They found that from 1970 to 1998 track forecast errors decreased by about 1 percent per year for the 24-hour forecast.    ''On a yearly basis, it's

Ileana doused the Baja resort towns of Los Cabos with rain, but ''nothing too severe,'' said Randy Lehr, the American manager of the Hacienda Beach Resort in Cabo San Lucas.    ''It looks like we got lucky, and the storm passed by to the south,'' Lehr said in a telephone interview. Guests at his hotel were warned to stay out of the ocean, and some whiled away the time playing pool.    The Mexican government declared a hurricane warning for Los Cabos and areas slightly north, as the storm's center whirled past about 50 miles south of the peninsula.    ''There hasn't been any damage so far, and the communications systems are working fine,'' Baja California state spokesman Juan Antonio Flores said.    Ileana, currently with winds of 70 mph, may strengthen to reach hurricane status, the National Hurricane Center in Miami reported.    Civil defense authorities in Los Cabos met to monitor the storm as it brushed by, moving west at about 12 mph. They had previously reported some outages in local telephone service due to the rains.    Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Beryl lumbered ashore on Mexico's northeast coast Tuesday, swirling into land over a sparsely populated stretch of coast about 110 miles south of the border cities of Brownsville, Texas, and Matamoros in Mexico.    The storm quickly weakened to tropical depression status as it dropped rain over northern Mexico, and the Mexican government discontinued most storm warnings for coastal areas.    The hurricane center reported Beryl could cause rainfall of 5 to 10 inches, but predicted the system would probably dissipate by Wednesday.    Beryl's winds had fallen to about 35 mph, and the weakening system was moving roughly west at about 9 mph.    Residents were evacuated from two low-lying fishing villages in the Gulf coast state of Tamaulipas and taken to improvised shelters at schools and a sports complex, the government news agency Notimex reported.    The National Weather Service canceled hurricane and tropical storm warnings for South Texas, where some heavy showers were reported.    Farmers in Texas said they hoped the thunderstorms would weaken the chokehold of a lingering drought. Showers were to continue throughout the day Tuesday and bring several inches of rain.    The storms also promised to refill dwindling reservoirs along the Rio Grande, National Weather Service forecaster Tim Speece said.    ''I'm not going to go out on a limb and say it'll end the drought, period,'' Speece said. ''But it'll definitely have an effect.''    ------    On the Net:    Hurricane Center: http://www.nhc.noaa.gov    Hurricane Central: http://www.weatherpoint.com/hc/home/0,1916,oso,00.html    Texas Department of Emergency Management: www.txdps.state.tx.us/dem    Storm 2000: http://www.gopbi.com/weather/storm  AP-NY-08-15-00 1543

Since the hurricane season began June 1, there were 12 tropical storms, eight of which became hurricanes, including and five major hurricanes _ Category 3 and higher. A Category 3 storm has winds of at least 111 miles per hour. This year's hurricanes claimed 76 lives, and cost about $4.3 billion in damages.    Last year, also an active hurricane season, there were 14 tropical storms, 10 of which became hurricanes, including three major hurricanes costing $7.3 billion.    Hurricane Floyd, which posed a serious threat to Florida and the Carolinas in September with winds up to 155 mph, killed 57 people and was the deadliest storm since Hurricane Agnes killed 122 people in 1972. Floyd ranked as the 20th deadliest U.S. hurricane in the century.    In October, Hurricane Irene battered Cuba and the Florida Keys with winds of 110 mph and caused the indirect deaths of eight people. Irene dumped torrential rains of up to 20 inches on Dade and Broward counties, causing urban flooding and $800 million in damage.    ``Hurricanes Floyd and Irene are cruel reminders that hurricanes can produce tragic loss of life and devastating economic disruption,'' Baker said.    The best predictor of hurricanes is the impact of El Nino and La Nina. El Nino is a disruption of ocean atmosphere systems in the Pacific Ocean resulting in warmer waters in the Pacific Ocean, while La Nina produces colder waters in the Pacific Ocean. As the colder waters of the Pacific Ocean shift, a change in the atmospheric winds occurs that generates the formation of hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean.    The annual average of hurricanes has increased over the past five years, said Jerry Jarrell, director of the National Hurricane Center. While officials have been largely successful in predicting hurricane tracks, they still lack the tools to forecast rapid changes in a hurricane's intensity.    Inland flooding remains the leading cause of hurricane deaths and damages. Jarrell said better education about hurricane flooding and reviews of evacuation routes is needed to reduce future hurricane devastation.

DEBUG:simuser.search.interfaces.pyterrier:raw text: REPEAT OF THE '38 HURRICANE WOULD BE MORE DAMAGING, LESS DEADLY  Nobody knew it was coming. The morning of Wednesday, Sept. 21, 1938, dawned to cloudy skies and a forecast of rain, but nobody had the slightest clue that New England was about to get walloped by a hurricane that for decades would rank as the most damaging storm in the nation's history.    In a few brief hours, some rivers reached record flood levels. A gust of wind at the Blue Hill Observatory in Milton was measured at 186 m.p.h.; for decades it was the second-highest wind speed ever recorded on this planet. Phone and electric lines _ 20,000 miles of them _ were knocked down, leaving seven-eighths of New England's homes without power. Nearly 100 bridges washed out, and almost 9,000 homes were destroyed. An estimated 275 million trees were snapped or uprooted. And more than 600 people perished in the blinding wind, rain, and waves.    New Englanders abruptly learned the hard way that hurricanes were not just a tropical concern.    Largely as a result, the region was far better prepared during large hurricanes that followed in the 40s and 50s, and today with improved satellite systems and computer analysis there would be enough warning to avert most of the loss of life from a similar storm. But the vast increase in development along the coast could make the physical damage even greater.    Although the storm was considered unprecedented in 1938, it turned out that New England had been hit before, and would be hit many times again _ though not in the 60 years since with such ferocity.    Far more people _ an estimated 6,000 _ had died in the famous Galveston flood of 1900, which was caused by a hurricane that originated in the same area off the coast of Africa; and the earthquake and fire that hit San Francisco in 1906 left more memorable images of destruction and ruin; but nothing short of war had ever caused as much devastation in this country as the hurricane of '38. And no storm on record anywhere in the world, up to that time, had caused so much damage.    Most weather forecasters at the time believed that hurricanes always veered out to sea before they could strike the New England coast, so even though this storm was being tracked as it moved rapidly northward _ much faster than most hurricanes do, sometimes at speeds exceeding 50 m.p.h. _ the official forecast from the National Weather Bureau, even that morning, made no mention of a hurricane. It was just a run-of-the-mill storm warning.    Kerry Emanuel, professor of meteorology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a specialist in hurricane modelling, says ``there was one renegade forecaster in Washington who thought it was going to hit New England, but nobody believed him.''    Charles Clark, acting chief of the Weather Bureau at the time, later explained that the forecasters ``could hardly have given any greater advance warning, for the tropical storm _ the worst in the history of the Northeast _ was a freak; it did not follow the usual pattern...''    Later analysis of historical records made it clear that the storm was not a freak. In fact, New England had suffered at least two equally devastating hurricanes: One in 1815, and, earlier, in 1635, soon after the Mayflower colonists arrived.    Governor William Bradford wrote about the storm of 1635, calling it ``such a mighty storm of wind &AMP; raine, as none living in these parts, either English or Indeans, ever saw.'' He described it, quite accurately, as resembling the ``Haurricanes'' of the West Indies. He wrote that it blew down many hundred thousands of trees, and that ``the signs and marks of it will remaine this 100 years in these parts where it was sorest.''    &UR;  &LR;  It was also described by Increase Mather as ``a most terrible storm ... whereby we were in as much danger, as I think ever people were.''    The great hurricane of 1815 was of similar scale, and by then the region had been substantially built up, so the damage was more devastating. John Farrar, a professor f

By MICHAEL NORTON    PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- Dumping drenching rains that caused dangerous flooding, Tropical Storm Debby stalked northern Haiti and forced thousands in Cuba to abandon homes as it pursued an erratic course that could threaten the Florida Keys.    Centered over northwest Haiti, Debby's winds dwindled from 75 mph Tuesday to 45 mph Wednesday and could weaken further over Cuba, forecasters said. But they warned the storm could produce battering waves, flash floods and mudslides -- and even strengthen again if it reaches the Gulf of Mexico.    The Florida Keys can expect a tropical storm warning or watch as early as Thursday morning, officials said.    ''The main concern right now is for the Keys -- not for a hurricane, but for a tropical storm,'' said Max Mayfield, director of the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami.    Taking no chances, officials on Wednesday ordered visitors to evacuate the Keys and shut down all schools.    Cuba evacuated at least 3,000 people, including Haitians at a refugee camp, from the eastern end of the island. Officials planned to evacuate thousands more -- including 700 tourists. Debby could dump up to 15 inches of rain over mountainous areas, and authorities predicted widespread flooding.    In northern Haiti, shantytown dwellers fled their homes on Turtle Island and huddled in shelters in driving rain. The storm flooded homes in Port-de-Paix and ripped tin roofs off shacks. Haiti's deforested mountains were clearly a worry.    ''We're especially afraid of heavy rain washing down from the mountains. ... We don't have any canals, and flooding will cause a lot of damage,'' said Smith Joseph, a journalist at private Radio Etincelle in Port-de-Paix.    He said high winds sank a boat in the harbor at the nearby coastal village of Carenage.    The Dominican Republic's emergency Civil Defense force said more than 700 people in towns and cities on the north coast were forced out of their homes by flooding.    At 11 p.m. EDT Wednesday, Debby was centered off the northwest tip of Haiti over the Windward Passage. It was moving west near 16 mph, headed for Cuba.    The storm should be over central Cuba by Thursday afternoon and then move into the Gulf of Mexico, where it was expected to turn north, brushing the west coast of Florida.    Debby was downgraded from hurricane status Wednesday when it lost force in the mountains of Hispaniola. Still, workers in the Dominican Republic evacuated dozens of people from riverside shacks and soldiers in the Bahamas deployed to several southern islands ahead of the storm.    As a minor hurricane on Tuesday, Debby caused little damage to Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and small northeast Caribbean islands. On Tuesday, a 78-year-old man died in a suburb of San Juan, Puerto Rico's capital, when he slipped from his roof while trying to dismantle an antenna.    ------    On the Net:    National Hurricane Center: http://www.nhc.noaa.gov    University of Puerto Rico's page: http://www.Upr.Clu.Edu/Nws  AP-NY-08-24-00 0118

Ileana doused the Baja resort towns of Los Cabos with rain, but ''nothing too severe,'' said Randy Lehr, the American manager of the Hacienda Beach Resort in Cabo San Lucas.    ''It looks like we got lucky, and the storm passed by to the south,'' Lehr said in telephone interview. Guests at his hotel were warned to stay out of the ocean, and some whiled away the time playing pool.    The Mexican government discontinued a hurricane warning for Los Cabos and areas slightly north after the storm's center whirled past 50 miles south of the peninsula.    ''There hasn't been any damage so far, and the communications systems are working fine,'' said Baja California state spokesman Juan Antonio Flores.    The storm, with winds of 70 mph, was churning out to sea at 10 mph.    Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Beryl lumbered ashore on Mexico's northeast coast Tuesday, swirling into land over a sparsely populated stretch of coast 110 miles south of the border cities of Matamoros and Brownsville.    The storm quickly weakened to tropical depression status as it dropped rain over northern Mexico, and the Mexican government discontinued most storm warnings for coastal areas.    The hurricane center reported Beryl could cause rainfall of 5 to 10 inches, but predicted the system would probably dissipate by Wednesday.    Beryl's winds had fallen to 35 mph, and the weakening system was moving roughly west at about 9 mph.    Authorities in the Mexican border state of Nuevo Leon evacuated about 1,500 people from low-lying areas near river beds Tuesday as the remnants of tropical storm Beryl approached the state capitol of Monterrey.    State civil defense officials said the evacuees would probably be able to return to their homes after a few hours, when the danger of flash flooding had decreased, the government news agency Notimex reported.    It rained intermittently Tuesday in Monterrey. The city is vulnerable to flash flooding because of insufficient storm drains.    The U.S. National Weather Service canceled hurricane and tropical storm warnings for South Texas, where some heavy showers were reported.  AP-NY-08-16-00 0005

The storm, which had degraded to a tropical storm Thursday night, again became a Hurricane Friday, unleashing intense winds and heavy rains directly onto the shore. On Virginia Beach, shop and hotel windows were blown out. Small trees and limbs lay along the sides of the road. It also lifted the roof off some houses and businesses. By late Friday afternoon, the storm again was downgraded to a tropical storm when winds dropped below hurricane-force to 110 kilometers per hour. The storm was 424 kilometers south-southwest of Nantucket Island in Massachusetts and moving to the northeast at 23 kph. Tropical storm warnings were in effect from Watch Hill, Rhode Island, to Plymouth, Massachusetts. Bonnie landed East Coast of the United States on Wednesday night with 185 kph winds, downing trees, tearing off roofs and flooding roads in North Carolina and South Carolina. It caused one billion to two billion U.S. dollars in damage, including that of farms, in North Carolina, and at least 27 million U.S. dollars in South Carolina. The Insurance Information Institute estimated Friday the industry will pay 375 million dollars in claims from Bonnie, mostly in North Carolina. A 12-year-old girl was killed in North Carolina's Currituck County, near the Virginia state line, when a tree fell on her house Thursday night, and a 50-year-old man in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, was electrocuted Wednesday while checking his generator after his apartment lost power. As the storm was moving north and off the mainland, North Carolina residents enjoyed a brilliant blue sky Friday. However, out in the Atlantic, another hurricane, Danielle, was closing to the coast, 500 kilometers north of San Juan, Puerto Rico, and strengthening with 145 kph winds. It was moving west-northwest at 255 kph toward the U.S. East Coast.

The storm, the biggest hurricane to strike Texas in nearly 20   years, continued to drench the region with thunderous squalls  today, but no injuries were reported since Bret made landfall about  6 p.m. Sunday in sparsely populated Kenedy County.  ``It sounded like a big jet engine was coming down on top of us.   It was very scary,'' Jesse Salinas said in Sarita, the only town in  Kenedy County.  There was little structural damage in Sarita, a town of 460   people, but power lines and trees were down, including several  large trees around the courthouse square.  Up to 25 inches of rain fell by early today on the coastal   plains of sparsely settled Kenedy County, where the average  rainfall for a whole year is 29.7 inches, the National Weather  Service said. Rain continued falling elsewhere and there was a  chance of flooding in places plus isolated tornadoes.  Damage was substantial in Falfurrias, about 60 miles southwest   of Corpus Christi, Mayor Michael Guerra said.  The eye passed over the town of about 5,800 residents about 3   a.m., ripping roofs from homes and businesses, he said. Up to 90  percent of the town had no electricity, he said.  ``We have a lot of debris and live power lines in the roads, and   we've had four convenience stores lose the canopies from their gas  pumps. And some of the less-structurally sound buildings have lost  roofs and windows,'' he said.  Power outages also were reported from the state's southern tip   near Brownsville and McAllen to the counties surrounding Corpus  Christi, said Jessica Mahaffey, spokeswoman for Central Power and  Light Co. in Corpus Christi. The company serves much of South  Texas.  ``The winds are still howling out there,'' Ms. Mahaffey said.   Repair crews have been working as wind conditions permit, and would  be joined by others today, she said.  Workers from federal and state agencies gathered this morning to   move into the storm-blown areas to assess the damage.  As of 11 a.m. EDT today, Bret had top sustained wind of 45 mph   and some higher gusts, the National Hurricane Center said. The  minimum for a hurricane is 74 mph.  Bret had been rated a Category 4 storm when it approached over   the Gulf of Mexico with 140 mph wind, piling waves 26 feet high at  one offshore weather buoy, but made landfall with wind down to 125  mph.  This morning, the center of Bret moved across rural southern   Texas, going west-northwest at 6 mph.  It was expected to turn westward toward Mexico, where more than   3,500 people living near the Rio Grande in Nuevo Laredo, just  across the border from Laredo, Texas, had been evacuated because of  the possibility of flooding, the government news agency Notimex  reported.  On Sunday, Bret unleashed its power on the deserted Padre Island   National Seashore, 70 miles south of Corpus Christi, before  continuing into desolate, sparsely populated ranch land.  Thousands of residents from Brownsville to Corpus Christi had   fled north and west as the hurricane approached. Windows throughout  the region were taped and boarded in anticipation of the worst  storm since Hurricane Allen, another Category 4 storm that struck  roughly the same area in 1980, causing $55 million in damage.  ``I think it was overpublicized,'' said Ralph Huff, who defied   conventional wisdom -- and an evacuation order -- and stayed in his  cinder block home overlooking Baffin Bay, just east of this small  agricultural town. His phone and power were still working late  Sunday.  Even though the storm's center passed less than 10 miles to the   south, ``there wasn't even any storm surge,'' he said.  The 125 mph wind, with gusts blowing even higher, extended 40   miles out from the storm when it first hit land. Forecasters feared  possible tornadoes, a foot or

DEBUG:simuser.search.interfaces.pyterrier:raw text: HURRICANE LOSES POWER AFTER STRIKING N.C. COASTLINE  The heart of Hurricane Floyd raked across the mainland here at Cape Fear Thursday morning, uprooting beach houses and leaving widespread floods as it set a rapid but steadily weakening course up the Atlantic coast.    The vast storm, whose advent alarmed much of the Eastern seaboard and widely disrupted air, rail and highway travel, was clearly losing its power with the dawn Thursday as the hurricane's eye danced across the coastline following a two-week buildup of the forces of nature and the precautions of government.    By Thursday evening, as Floyd reached northeastward along the New Jersey coast to New York City, its strength had further waned. It was downgraded to a tropical storm that still delivered lashing rain but that officials said presented no major threat to New York or other population centers.    In the howling predawn of this coastal city, Floyd's power was measured to be dropping from a Category 4 to a Category 2 hurricane before dropping further to a tropical storm. While storm-drenched hurricane veterans were delighted after all the ominous evacuation warnings that it delivered far less physical injury and property destruction than originally feared, Floyd nevertheless proved relentlessly drenching, dropping as much as 19 inches of rain in some areas.    ``We were blessed this time,'' Fire Chief Keith Studt said as he roamed flooded streets and hacked away at fallen trees cluttering the streets of nearby Winter Park. ``We were lucky this thing suddenly ratcheted down before it hit town.''    Even so, the flooding and house damage out on Oak Island and other coastal barrier islands was considerable as the storm headed unpredictably northward, causing further disruption across a wide swath of the seaboard. Residents emerged uncertainly here from emergency centers to blink at piles of suddenly sun-dappled debris. By then Floyd was speeding up along the coast by Virginia, Chesapeake Bay and the New Jersey shore.    It lost further power but still spewed fresh damage along its western flank as the storm was described as fading into a rough course aimed toward eastern Long Island. But travel turmoil was widespread during the day and quickly became bumper to bumper around Washington, as a truck overturned on the storm-lashed Chesapeake Bay Bridge and blocked one of the major regional arteries.    At least five fatalities across Floyd's path were listed tentatively as storm-related, but local residents here waited through a long night in fear of even worse things.    The storm's eye loomed out of the Atlantic's 30-foot seas as a somewhat tentative invader, avoiding a deep inland attack and cutting across Cape Fear at 3:20 a.m. to begin a rapid ride up the coastline. Open relief at the turning was the reaction from this storm-hardened city, which has had to batten down for five hurricanes in the last three years.    ``It was merciful that it didn't come through at the 155 mph they were first talking about,'' said James Blanton, hitching his pickup truck's chain to a tree fallen across the road to his granddaughter's house. ``That's what saved us, even with all this flooding.''    For a while, the storm registered sustained winds of 98 mph that gusted up to 130, tearing up the roof of the Brunswick County Hospital to the south. There was some roof damage as well to Wilmington's historic Cotton Exchange building, which is now a shopping mall centerpiece.    One unnerving accident was the draining of 2 million gallons from a hog waste lagoon into the Northeast Cape Fear River, about 40 miles to the north.    But otherwise the storm caused minimal structural damage here, as in South Carolina.

NESMITH    PUERTO PLATA, Dominican Republic (AP) - Emergency workers evacuated dozens of people from riverside shacks in Dominican Republic and gusty rain tore roofs off homes in Haiti as Tropical Storm Debby skirted the island of Hispaniola.    Debby was downgraded from a hurricane when it lost some force Wednesday morning and was further disrupted by the mountains of Hispaniola.    ''It's good news for the people of southeast Florida and the Bahamas,'' said forecaster Michelle Huber of the National Hurricane Center. She said there was less chance now of Debby becoming a dangerous hurricane with over 100 mph winds than was earlier feared.    Still, officials in the Florida Keys on Wednesday ordered visitors to evacuate and also shut down all schools.    Outer rainbands dumped heavy rain on northern Haiti overnight, tearing away tin roofs from shanties and flooding some homes in the northwest town of Port-de-Paix, police reported.    Trucks with megaphones patrolled the streets of Cap Haitien, Haiti's second-largest city, broadcasting warnings of the coming storm.    Soldiers in the Bahamas deployed on several southern islands Tuesday and more were being sent to other islands Wednesday ahead of the storm.    At 2 p.m. EDT Wednesday, Debby was centered off Monte Cristi, in the Dominican Republic, and about 45 miles from Cap Haitien. It was moving west near 18 mph and was expected to keep that track through Wednesday.    Winds were down to 60 mph and the U.S. National Hurricane Center said it was expected to get even weaker. Tropical storm-force winds extended 175 miles from the center.    Before dawn Wednesday, emergency workers from the Dominican Civil Defense woke up people living alongside rivers in the resort town of Puerto Plata - fearing the rivers would overflow their banks - and sent them to relatives or some of the 50 shelters. Deputy director Ojilbiz Mercado said 250 people were evacuated in Puerto Plata.    But Debby's strongest winds faced out to sea and it was hard to tell it was so close with the sun peeking occasionally through sun and drizzle.    In Cabarete resort village, 27-year-old Sandrine Kowalik of Paris said the hurricane was making her vacation ''more exciting.''    ''It's something that we're not used to in France,'' she said as she walked along a calm beach. ''It's a very small one, right?''    A 15-minute drive away, street vendor Placido Padilla, 53, watched high waves breaking over garbage strewn on the beach less than 100 feet from his home.    ''They should have brought the army in here because people don't want to leave unless everbody leaves,'' he said.    The rain had caused open sewers to overflow into muddy roads where children played.    In Florida, emergency officials urged southern residents to pay close attention to weather reports. ''We're like everybody else,'' said Elizabeth Hirst, spokeswoman for Gov. Jeb Bush. ''In the wait-and-see mode.''    South Floridians stuffed shopping carts with bottled water, canned food, milk, batteries and other emergency supplies - just in case.    ''It's good to be prepared because even if the hurricane doesn't hit, we may still get blackouts,'' said Clara Milanes, 64.    Forecasters said they may post a hurricane watch in south Florida on Wednesday.    Hurricane warnings were posted for the Turks and Caicos, the southeastern Bahamas and the northern Dominican Republic. Cuba posted a hurricane watch for its north coast and added parts of the south coast on Wednesday. A hurricane watch was in effect for the rest of the Bahamas and northern Haiti.    As a relatively minor hurricane on Tuesday, Debby brought some rain and little apparent damage to the U.S. territories of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands and a number of small islands such as Antigua and Anguilla.    ''This storm was quite confusing in terms of all the various changes it made,'' said Gene Walker, head of the Virgin Islands' emergency response agency. ''

The revived Mitch severely struck the Florida Keys with tornadoes, flipping mobile homes, uprooting trees and cutting power lines and leading to one highway death. The island chain had been hit by hurricane Georges, which destroyed or damaged 4,000 homes in late September. Hurricane Mitch had weakened significantly after killing at least 9,000 people during a rampage through Central America last week. But it revived itself to tropical storm strength while plowing over the Gulf of Mexico toward Florida. By Wednesday, several tornadoes had touched down in Key Largo and one struck in Islamorada. Trailers were turned over and people were trapped inside. Farther North, winds gusts reached about 110 kmp near Miami, where flooding slowed morning commuters. Seven people were treated for storm-related injuries. The Coast Guard rescued a man and a woman Wednesday after their boat sank in large swells off West Palm Beach. State officials opened three storm shelters Wednesday in the Keys, housing some 200 people. A tropical storm warning extended from the Florida Keys north to Tarpon Springs on Florida's Gulf coast, and north to New Smyrna Beach on the Atlantic coast. The storm was expected to move out to sea by this afternoon.

DEBUG:simuser.search.interfaces.pyterrier:raw text: &HT;    A massive storm named Floyd became the fourth hurricane of the season Friday and forecasters fear it will become a monster.    While it's too early to tell whether it will strike South Florida, the storm took an eerie path Friday, landing in the same position as Hurricane Andrew in 1992, said National Weather Service meteorologist Jim Lushine.    But while Andrew moved faster on its Atlantic trek, Floyd is progressing more slowly and gathering strength from warm tropical waters, strength that forecasters say will ultimately make it a Category 3 storm with winds up to 130 mph.    Floyd should reach the central Bahama Islands Monday afternoon with winds of up to about 110 mph, forecasters said.    On Thursday, they issued a tropical storm watch for the northern Leeward Islands as strong winds from the storm's outer bands stretched about 175 miles.    As of late Friday, Floyd was located about 415 miles east, northeast of Puerto Rico with sustained winds of 80 mph.    ``People need to know there's a real threat out there and the Southeast is not off the hook,'' said Max Mayfield, deputy director of the National Hurricane Center. ``It will likely turn north eventually, but what we can't say is whether that will happen off the coast or inland.''    Floyd formed earlier this week off Africa's Cape Verdi Islands as a typical September tropical wave. The National Hurricane Center issued its first advisory Tuesday. When the center's plane visited the storm early Friday, it discovered Floyd had grown to hurricane strength.    Hurricane hunters plan to return to the storm today and the next three days to gather information to be fed into the center's computer models that predict the storm's course, Mayfield said.    Forecasters are particularly troubled by a weather trough over the southeastern United States that helped steer Hurricane Dennis offshore earlier this month.    ``Unfortunately, it's not going to remain there by the time Floyd gets up to the southeastern coast,'' Mayfield said. ``It will gradually lift to the northeast and what we're concerned about is that a ridge of high pressure will build north of the hurricane. If that does happen, it will allow a more west, northwest motion.''    Still, forecasters say another trough should move over the central United States during the next four days.    ``Depending on how far east it gets will determine in part what happens to Floyd,'' Mayfield said.    During the day Friday, Floyd became better organized and even produced an eye briefly in the afternoon, forecasters said. Because of its size, Lushine compared the storm to Hurricane Hugo, the 1989 storm that blasted Charleston, S.C., and caused $6 billion in damages.    ``Hugo had winds that extended out 200 miles and hurricane winds out 100 miles whereas (1992's Hurricane Andrew) had hurricane winds half that size,'' he said.    ``Andrew was really a symmetrical storm in terms of thunderstorms around it, that were all equal distance from the center. This storm and Hugo are asymmetric, which has implications in terms of its outer effects. Tornadoes are more likely because there are more outer bands to have tornadoes in and because it's much bigger, it's much wetter.''    For most of the weekend, Palm Beach County and the Treasure Coast will have warm calm weather, with highs in the upper 80s and 90s and lows in the 70s. There is a 40 percent chance of afternoon showers.    Story Filed By Cox Newspapers    For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service

DEBUG:simuser.search.interfaces.pyterrier:raw text: &HT;    Hello, Dennis. Goodbye drought?    If Hurricane Dennis dumps tropical rains from Florida to Virginia on Sunday and into next week, the storm could be just the tonic to help quench a thirsty South, parched by drought the last 17 months.    Forecasters said Dennis and other tropical storms headed toward the United States could help replenish the water-strapped South, which is running 2-foot rainfall deficits in some places. Among those who would rather get their rain some other way is Ray Allen, a 56-year-old North Carolina farmer who tends 500 acres in Elizabethtown, 80 miles inland from Myrtle Beach, S.C. _ a potential coastal target for Dennis.    ``Hurricanes are not our friends,'' said Allen, whose crops were drenched by afternoon rains not associated with the coming of Dennis two days this week. ``Winds will hurt you more than the rain will help you.''    Lack of rain already has damaged his corn crop. More than 40 percent of his tobacco crop _ including the most valuable plant tips _ remains in the field. Last year, Hurricane Bonnie blew apart 39 percent of his tobacco. The storm dropped 20 inches of rain in some parts of the state.    ``Sometimes, probably you hear farmers say that a hurricane made their crop,'' Allen said. ``But I'm not sure. I think they tear up more than they ever help.''    Hurricane Dennis was moving less than 10 mph Friday. One computer model showed an inland storm system pushing Dennis out to sea. Another had it brushing Florida before coming perilously close to Charleston.    ``The trend now looks like it will get caught in a low pressure trough and head northeast so most of the rain would stay on the coast,'' said Jan Jackson, a meteorologist in Blacksburg, Va., one of the driest places in the country.    A direct hit is what's needed to ease water problems in places such as Atlanta and the Research Triangle.    ``If we get a glancing blow, Georgia will probably not get enough rain to be beneficial,'' said David Stooksbury, Georgia's state climatologist and a professor of engineering at the University of Georgia. ``Basically, it's going to have to go right over us to have much of a beneficial impact.''    North Carolina, Tennessee and South Carolina have asked for federal assistance to help farmers recover drought losses. In Georgia, nearly 80 percent of the state suffers from a moderate to severe drought, especially in the southern farm regions.    Severe drought has seared Virginia's Shenandoah Valley. Roanoke's reservoirs have dipped to historic lows.    If Dennis or other tropical storms penetrate deeply inland, ``it could have quite an impact,'' said Jackson, the Virginia meteorologist. ``Usually this time of year, that's what ends droughts.'' A drenching of 6 to 8 inches over several days would be optimal.    ``Yes, the rain will be welcomed,'' Stooksbury said. ``But the trick is getting the rain without getting enough to have flooding.''    In July 1994, Tropical Storm Alberto lingered over Georgia for five days, drenching some places with 28 inches of rain, turning country roads into canals. Nearly 700 billion gallons of water washed into the Flint River between Albany and Newton.    ``Any rain we're going to get is helpful. But we also don't want 6 inches in six hours,'' Stooksbury said. ``That will cause untold problems. Even in agriculture, we can't say everyone wants rain.''    Hurricane Dennis could produce up to 15 inches of rain along the Georgia coast, Georgia Emergency Management Agency Director Gary McConnell said Friday.    Last week, Hurricane Bret washed across the southern tip of Texas then pushed to the middle of the state. The storm destroyed $27 million of cotton.    On the plus side, it soaked the inland Rio Grande Valley, which grows a bountiful crop of grapefruit and oranges. But drenching rain could seriously damage Deep South cotton and tobacco.    ``The torrential rains would only hurt some of those big tobacco leaves,'' said Bob Graham, chief agricultural statistician for South Carolina, which

Schools closed, people rushed to buy emergency supplies and governments prepared shelters. Tourists crowded airports to flee the storm and airlines began canceling flights. Cruise ships turned away from the winds and rain.    Ten ships and two submarines in the USS Harry Truman battle group abandoned training exercises off Vieques island and moved 300 miles south of Puerto Rico, the Navy said. Vieques is the site of recurrent protests over military exercises.    The fourth named storm of the Atlantic season emerged with unnerving suddenness as the season's first threat to land.    At 8 p.m. EDT, Debby was centered about 115 miles east-southeast of Antigua, heading for French, Dutch and British islands overnight and expected to continue onto the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico Tuesday and then the Dominican Republic. Forecasters said it was too early to say whether the storm could threaten the U.S. mainland.    Debby seemingly came out of nowhere Saturday and reached near-hurricane strength in little more than a day. Its sustained winds reached nearly 70 miles per hour late morning Monday, just shy of the 74 miles per hour to be classified as a hurricane.    Debby was churning west at about 22 mph, especially fast for such a storm, and was expected to intensify and keep on the same track for the next three days. The weather service said winds were expected to reach about 86 mph.    Hurricane warnings were posted from the French island of Guadeloupe north through the island chain including Dutch St. Maarten, Saba, and St. Eustatius, through the British and U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. The Dominican Republic went on storm watch Monday night.    Debby could be a hurricane by the time it hits Guadeloupe and the Caribbean's easternmost islands around 10 p.m. Monday, said forecaster Henry Laskosky at the National Weather Service office in San Juan.    In volcano-plagued Montserrat, British Gov. Anthony Abbott warned in a radio broadcast that ''There's a possibility that Debby could pass right over Montserrat.''    Stormy weather likely would cause mudflows of volcanic debris down the Belham River, the Montserrat Volcano Observatory warned, though that area has been in the restricted danger zone.    Meteorologists in Antigua warned their residents to prepare for a direct hit.    Electricity on some parts of Antigua went out, apparently turned off to avoid storm damage. Motorists lined up for gas, and emergency specialists warned people living in roofless homes unrepaired since last year's hurricanes to get ready to head to shelters.    A flight by a hurricane hunter airplane Monday morning showed Debby was outpacing even the experts' forecasts.    ''It's moving faster and it's also more intense than we had thought,'' Laskosky said.    In the twin-island nation of St. Kitts and Nevis, Debby threatened to soak Carifesta, a 35-nation arts and music festival that began Thursday.    Carnival Cruise Lines said it was diverting three of its ships now in the eastern Caribbean to areas further north, west and south to avoid the storm.    In the U.S. Virgin Islands, the National Park Service shut down its grounds on the island of St. John. Boaters moored off the park were told to move to safe harbors.    Hotels were refusing new reservations as their guests tried to flee the storm.    ''Yachties'' spent the day securing boats in mangrove swamps and other relatively safe areas like Hurricane Hole on the U.S. Virgin Island of St. John.

The storm is expected to bring high winds and flooding to   Florida's west coast as it hits land Tuesday. But many residents  and visitors were strolling and playing on the beach, unconcerned  about forecasts that the winds could approach hurricane strength.  ``This one isn't really half so bad, is it?'' asked David Ray,   whose vacation from England included a stay in Orlando last week  during Hurricane Floyd.  That storm grazed the state's east coast as it swept from the   Bahamas to New England -- causing dozens of deaths and massive  damage.  At 2 a.m. EDT Tuesday, Harvey was centered about 120 miles   west-southwest of St. Petersburg, moving east-northeast near 9 mph.  It took a slight turn to the south early Tuesday, but was still  moving toward Florida.  Maximum sustained winds increased to near 60 mph, with higher   gusts. Tropical storm force winds of at least 39 mph extended as  much as 205 miles.  Forecasters expected Harvey would spin across the Florida   peninsula and stay offshore as it heads north along the U.S. East  Coast, sparing places like North Carolina.  Gov. Jeb Bush declared a state of emergency throughout Florida,   except for the extreme northwest, in the Panhandle.  In Florida, a flood watch was posted for much of central,   southwest and northeast Florida through Tuesday, including areas  soaked last week by Hurricane Floyd.  A tropical storm warning was in effect for much of the western   Florida coast, while a Hurricane watch remained in effect from just  south of Fort Meyers to the mouth of the Suwannee River north of  Tampa.  Voluntary evacuations were called Monday afternoon in counties   in the storm's path. Rainfall totals of 5 to 10 inches were likely.  Harvey could produce storm surge flooding of 3 to 6 feet above   normal, up to 8 feet above normal at the heads of bays, said  hurricane center forecasters.  Meanwhile, Bermuda's government issued a hurricane warning for   the island Monday.  At 2 a.m., Gert was 200 miles south-southeast of Bermuda and   moving to the north-northwest at about 12 mph. Top sustained winds  were at 110 mph, with some weakening expected in the next 24 hours.

The storm, the biggest hurricane to strike Texas in nearly 20   years, continued to drench the region with thunderous squalls, but  no injuries were reported since Bret made landfall about 6 p.m.  Sunday in sparsely populated Kenedy County.  Up to 25 inches of rain had fallen in the county by early today   and flooding was expected, the National Weather Service said. Some  roofs were blown off in Falfurrias as the storm moved inland this  morning, the weather service said.  Workers from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Texas   Division of Emergency Management and the Texas Department of Public  Safety prepared this morning to move into the storm-blown areas.  ``At first daylight, there will be preliminary damage assessment   teams that will go into the area and begin to inspect the damage,''  FEMA spokesman Brad Craine said today.  As of 6 a.m. EDT today, Bret remained a Category 1 hurricane --   the weakest of five possible strengths -- with 85 mph winds. The  former Category 4 storm made landfall with winds blowing at 125  mph.  On Sunday, Bret unleashed its power on the deserted Padre Island   National Seashore, 70 miles south of Corpus Christi, before  continuing into desolate, sparsely populated ranch land.  The center of Bret moved inland over Brooks County as it headed   west toward Mexico at 5 mph. Hurricane warnings along the coast  were downgraded to tropical storm warnings this morning.  Thousands of residents from Brownsville to Corpus Christi had   fled north and west as the hurricane approached. Windows throughout  the region were taped and boarded in anticipation of the worst  storm since Hurricane Allen, another Category 4 storm that struck  roughly the same area in 1980, causing $55 million in damage.  ``I think it was overpublicized,'' said Ralph Huff, who defied   conventional wisdom -- and an evacuation order -- and stayed in his  cinder block home overlooking Baffin Bay, just east of this small  agricultural town. His phone and power were still working late  Sunday.  Despite the storm's center passing less than 10 miles to the   south, ``there wasn't even any storm surge,'' he said.  The 125 mph winds, with gusts blowing even higher, extended 40   miles out from the storm when it first hit land. Forecasters feared  possible tornadoes, a foot or more of rain and a storm surge that  could approach 10 to 15 feet as it moved over land.  Before the tightly-focused storm made land, National Weather   Service forecaster Jim Hoke said it had ``clear potential of  producing major disaster.'' He compared the storm to Hurricane  Andrew, which battered Florida in 1992.  As Bret arrived, whitecaps crashed into Corpus Christi's seawall   and palm trees along the cost bent and frayed with the gusts. A few  surfers in Corpus Christi even took to the storm-fed waves.  For those who fled, shelters were set up inland in San Antonio,   and hotels offered discounts for evacuees with proof of residence.  A few stragglers stayed behind on the Padre and Mustang barrier   islands after all access to the mainland was severed. The incoming  storm, coupled with high tide, threatened to cause coastal  flooding.  Gov. George W. Bush said he would sign disaster proclamations   for seven counties: Aransas, San Patricio, Kenedy, Cameron,  Willacy, Nueces and Kleberg.  President Clinton issued a major disaster declaration Sunday   night for the seven counties, freeing funds to help local  governments with emergency supplies and debris removal, said FEMA  Director James Lee Witt.  Texas hadn't been hit by a hurricane since Hurricane Jerry   killed three people in October 1989. However, the state's  367-mile-long coast has been struck by tropical storms since then,  including Charley, which dumpe

DEBUG:simuser.search.interfaces.pyterrier:raw text: STORM WEAKENS, BUT COULD STRENGTHEN ONCE AGAIN  Tropical Storm Debby lost momentum as it spun westward through the rough mountains of the island of Hispaniola and headed toward the northern coast of Cuba, where the storm was expected to weaken even more before threatening the Florida coast or moving into the Gulf of Mexico.    South Floridians, who have tensely followed the arrival of the first hurricane this season to threaten the state's coastline, were relieved when the storm was downgraded Wednesday morning to a tropical storm, but forecasters here warned that the state is still in danger.    Winds had slipped to below 60 mph by Wednesday evening as the storm moved across the Dominican Republic and then Haiti, dumping heavy rain and tearing the tin roofs off homes.    The rugged terrain broke up the already weakening storm, which was good news for Florida and the rest of the coastal United States.    ``The mountains of Hispaniola have really disrupted the circulation,'' said Max Mayfield, the director of the National Hurricane Center in Miami. ``Not only has it not strengthened, it has weakened and will likely continue to weaken as the center moves up onto Cuba.''    The hurricane is already looking ragged _ a tight spiral of clouds denotes a stronger, more dangerous storm _ as it seems headed, forecasters tentatively predicted, for the Florida Straits and then on into the Gulf.    That would carry the storm over or close to the Florida Keys, where emergency management officials Wednesday ordered an evacuation of tourists _ a move that they hoped would open up the roads for Keys residents if they are ordered to leave later this week.    ``We're just asking residents right now to put their hurricane plans into effect,'' said Becky Herrin, a spokeswoman for the Monroe County Emergency Operations Center.    The worst thing that could happen, said the state's emergency management officials, is for people fleeing the coast to be trapped in traffic as a storm bears down.    Keys residents, who are accustomed to such things, boarded up windows with plywood, stocked up on water and flashlight batteries, and watched their televisions for the latest weather updates. But, as the storm weakened, some residents relaxed, let their dogs out for a run on the unusually quiet streets, and waited.    In the usually boisterous bars on Duval Street, people who rely on the tourists for their living said they definitely were not better off alone.    ``It's dead, for us,'' said Kathy Wolfort, a bartender and waitress in the famous Key West bar, Sloppy Joe's. ``Usually right now, our whole dining room is full.'' Of the 65 tables in the restaurant, only 15 were being used.    Forecasters warned that the good news about Debby might not last, and that the storm could strengthen once it heads back over water, perhaps in the Straits or the Gulf, and said it could threaten the west coast of Florida, or the Panhandle, or elsewhere in the Gulf.    The storm skirted Puerto Rico, but brought only minimum damage there and in the U.S. Virgin Islands.    In Miami, some residents went to buy plywood and other emergency supplies, but the threat, at least for the city and surrounding area, seemed to have evaporated.    ``It doesn't look to us like there is any chance this will become a hurricane, at least in the short term,'' said Mayfield.    But there was still a chance that the storm would turn slightly more north, and threaten South Florida.    ``We don't want to let our guard down,'' said Mayfield.    If the storm does pass through the Straits and heads into the warm waters of the Gulf, it could pick up strength and threaten the Gulf Coast, he said.    Hurricane Frederick in 1979 did just that, he said. It was a ragged storm, too, but became a dangerous hurricane as it swept across the Gulf to the coast of Alabama.    Even if winds do not create much damage, the storm is expected to bring torrential rains, wherever it makes landfall.

But locals know that if a big storm blows in, the manmade dune guarding $400,000 beachfront homes would be as vulnerable as a child's sand castle at high tide.    ``That dune looks nice, and it makes you feel like you've got a little security,'' said Wayne Thompson, 42, a sun-beaten contractor who stays busy rebuilding decks and walkways damaged by the beachfront erosion. ``But you get a hurricane in here, it won't last.''    This summer's high tides are actually nibbling away at portions of Holden Beach's 4 1/2 mile-long dune, a nail-biting reminder that these barrier islands are even more fragile two years after hurricanes Bertha and Fran plowed ashore 15 miles east of here at the Cape Fear River.    ``We are about as prepared as we can be,'' said Mike Morgan, manager of Holden Beach, a popular family beach enjoying one of its best summers in years. ``We have our fingers crossed.''    Up and down the East Coast, the anticipation of hurricane season is as enduring a summertime ritual as eating fried seafood at Calabash, N.C., and shag-dancing at Myrtle Beach. Tourism worth billions of dollars drives coastal economies from Key West to Nags Head, N.C., and for the past two years beach towns have been riding a lucky streak.    During 1997 and so far this summer, the East Coast has been spared from hurricanes, but even with Alex's breakup, forecasters were predicting trouble for the east coast. Following the remnants of Alex was a large tropical wave about midway between the Lesser Antilles and the Cape Verde islands Sunday that could brew into a storm. Weather watchers also have warned of the potential for greater hurricane activity from the emerging La Nina, the weather counter-balance to spring's troublesome El Nino.    It is unusual for the African tropics to spawn storms such as Alex this early in the hurricane season, forecasters say. But when they do, they typically signal that the remainder of the season will be active, as was the case two summers ago when North Carolina suffered the one-two punch of hurricanes Bertha and Fran.    Bertha hit on July 12, 1996, softening up the coastal defenses for the Sept. 5 assault by Fran, North Carolina's most costly natural disaster with damages of an estimated $6.5 billion and 22 deaths. The destruction reached as far inland as Raleigh, but was most punishing on Topsail Island, a narrow spit northeast of Wilmington.    Federal aid to North Carolina in disaster-assistance grants, loans and payments was an estimated $1 billion.    The beaches southwest of Wilmington escaped with relatively little damage. On Holden Beach, estimated damages of $200,000 included houses that lost shingles, siding and a small number of decks. Even so, people who've watched nor'easterns and other unnamed storms eat away at these beaches say southeastern North Carolina's coastline is poorly prepared for a major assault.    Back in 1954, Hurricane Hazel cut Holden Beach in two, and more than four decades later, the newly constructed beachfront dune wouldn't stand a chance against a similar storm, experts said.    ``Before Fran and Bertha, the beaches were in bad shape,'' said Bill Cleary, a geology professor at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington. ``They are even more vulnerable to storms because the beaches have not rebuilt as they were expected to rebuild.''    Cleary's studies at UNC-Wilmington's Center for Marine Science Research have found that big storms push sand far off shore, rather than deposit on the ocean floor just beyond the low-tide mark. The result, he said, is narrow beaches that provide little resistance to the punishing tidal surges that accompany big storms.    Cleary called Holden Beach's dune a ``Band-aid approach that would not last at all.''    Morgan, Holden Beach's manager,

Saturday, steady rains will spread into southeast New England as Atlantic moisture streams inland north of a tandem of low pressure systems along the Eastern Seaboard. Up to 2 inches of rain are possible, particularly on higher ground away from the coast, where moist ocean winds are forced to rise over the sloping terrain.    Farther south, thunderstorms will erupt over the Middle Atlantic Seaboard as a cold front associated with the low pressure system over the Northeast wedges under and lifts very humid air. A few of the storms will approach severe levels, with damaging straight-line winds and large hail posing threats.    The area at greatest risk will span from eastern Virginia and the Delmarva Peninsula to North Carolina, where cooling aloft associated with the jet stream disturbance combines with low-level warmth to destabilize the atmosphere.    Scattered heavy thunderstorms will rumble across southern Florida as sea-breeze fronts lift low-level humid air. With moisture also arriving overhead from Tropical Storm Bret swirling slowly northward over the Bay of Campeche, rainfalls could exceed two inches in some places.    Meanwhile, bands of fitful showers and thunderstorms on the northern flank of Tropical Storm Bret will approach extreme south Texas, though the heaviest rains will stay over northeast Old Mexico.    FOCUS: WHAT'S IN A NAME    Hurricane Dora became a typhoon as it moved west across the International Date Line late Thursday. The transformation was not a meteorological one, but rather a matter of bookkeeping. Hurricanes and typhoons are the same type of storm, but these mature tropical swirls with winds over 64 knots are given different names in different parts of the globe. They are called hurricanes in the Atlantic or eastern Pacific and typhoons in the western Pacific. Near the Philippines such a storm is locally called a baguio. In the Indian Ocean, the storms are known by the generic name ``tropical cyclone.''

While most residents of North Carolina's coastline breathed a sigh of relief Thursday, emerging from houses and shelters to discover minimal damage by Hurricane Bonnie, Crisp was wading through waist deep water inspecting his flooded business.    ``It's sad,'' he said looking out over his waterlogged inventory of recreational vehicles. ``I tell you, it's sad. This is the third time one of these storms has done this to me.''    Luckily for most everyone else, Crisp was in the minority Thursday, one of the few with the unpleasant task of counting their losses rather than their blessings.    When Hurricane Bonnie churned through the Atlantic Ocean off the North Carolina coast three days ago, it was a Category 3 storm 400 miles wide with winds of 115 mph. Many feared it would cause severe damage to an area that had barely begun to heal from the last big storm.    But as it weakened to a tropical storm and headed out to sea Thursday, state officials expressed relief that damage to structures, to fragile beaches, to trees, to power lines were all being tallied in the ``minor'' column.    Above all, they were elated that Bonnie had caused no loss of life or serious injuries.    ``That's amazing, really,'' said Susan Perkins, a spokeswoman for the state division of emergency management. ``People here are surprised and happy.''    Bonnie was downgraded to a tropical storm in the early afternoon Thursday after coming ashore 24 hours earlier near Cape Fear and then tracking slowly up the North Carolina coast, dumping sheets of rain. Wilmington, the biggest city in its path, received upward of 8 inches, and forecasters had predicted as much as 20 inches could fall.    The fact that Bonnie was moving so slowly, anywhere between 4 mph and 8 mph after landfall, led officials to express concern that severe flooding would occur. And while the rain did fall in sheets, the only significant flooding occurred along the banks of the Pamlico River near the city of Washington, and it was caused by storm surge, not rain.    Because they are still so fresh in the minds of many residents here, Bonnie was often compared to hurricanes Fran and Bertha, which struck in 1996    Fran and Bertha both sent water into the basement of dentist Jeff Rumley's house on the Pamlico River, a house built in 1874 by a North Carolina lumber baron and which, presumably, has weathered many such storms. Bonnie failed to measure up to her predecessors.    ``This was nothing like it was with Fran,'' Rumley said. ``This (water) came in real slow and it's starting to leave real fast. It didn't push in like Frank and break things as it went. It just rose real slowly.''    About 80 miles away, near Cape Carteret, Claude Murdoch, a 67-year-old, ``semi-retired'' mechanic had already mopped the mud off the floor of his modest house on the shores of the Intracoastal Waterway. The flood damage to his place was also the result of storm surge, which had further damaged the pier he is trying to build that keeps getting torn up by hurricanes.    ``Me and her (his wife Jessie B. Murdoch), we mopped it real good,'' Murdoch said as the winds whipped the sound behind him into dancing whitecaps. ``She's got cancer real bad. I still got damage from Fran I ain't ever fixed. I would have if I didn't have to work to pay for her radiation treatments.''    By later afternoon, convoys of power company trucks headed into the hurricane area from their staging area in Raleigh, ready to restore power to the 250,000 people still without it. Convoys of National Guard troops also were headed to the coast to offer their assistance.    President Clinton on Thursday declared 10 North Carolina counties disaster areas, an act that opens the federal financial spigots and which will help those whose property was damaged by the storm.

All of the Bahamas -- a 600-mile-long line of islands -- was under   hurricane warnings or watches. Forecasters said they might also  issue a hurricane watch for part of Florida's east coast Monday.  If Floyd stays on its current path, it would hit the coast of   Florida between West Palm Beach and Cocoa Beach. Forecasters  expected the hurricane to begin turning north before landfall,  though perhaps not much before.  A U.S. hurricane hunter airplane reported Sunday evening that   Floyd's winds had topped the 131 mph mark of a very dangerous  Category 4 storm.  ``I didn't expect such a very fast intensification today,'' said   Jerry Jarrell, director of the National Hurricane Center in Miami.  ``This is a real surprise for us.''  Hurricane Andrew had Category 4 status when it struck South   Florida in 1992, killing 26 people and causing an estimated $25  billion in damage.  Experts said that by Tuesday Hurricane Floyd could approach the   Abacos Islands and Eleuthera, which were blasted last month by  Hurricane Dennis.  ``I just got back on my feet from last month's scare,'' sighed   Marie Johnson of Nassau as she pulled out a few bills to pay for  flashlight and radio batteries at the City Market grocery store.  The U.S. National Weather Service recommended people along the   southeast coast monitor the storm's course.  In Florida, emergency management officials began mobilizing,   with the state's Emergency Operations Center in Tallahassee calling  in essential personnel for 'round-the-clock staffing.  Many Floridians took advantage of the weekend's final day to   take careful inventory of their hurricane supplies. Osvaldo Ibarra,  hardware manager at a Home Depot in Miami, said sales were brisk  for batteries, nails, rope and hurricane shutter fasteners.  ``People are really buying the extra screws, the rope, and we've   seen a lot more generator sales,'' Ibarra said.  In Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, south of the storm's   center, meteorologists warned that the terrain was already  saturated, and that there could be heavy flooding.  Officials posted warnings for Hurricane Floyd across the central   Bahamas and hurricane watches throughout the northwest Bahamas.  Tropical storm warnings were in effect for the southeast Bahamas  and Britain's Turks and Caicos Islands.  The storm swelled in size during the weekend. Hurricane-force   winds had broadened to 115 miles from Floyd's center by Sunday.  Tropical storm force winds extended another 175 miles, and  forecasters said the storm would likely strengthen overnight  Sunday.  At 11 p.m. EDT, Floyd was centered about 330 miles east of San   Salvador in the central Bahamas, and was moving west at near 14  mph.  Floyd's center is likely to pass close to the capital, Nassau,   on Tuesday morning, said Arthur Rolle, deputy director of the  Bahamas Meteorological Department.  On Sunday, tourists in Nassau watched weather reports nervously.   Honeymooners Michael and Julie Smith of Reynoldsburg, Ohio,  lamented their bad luck.  ``I hope this doesn't mean our marriage is going to be like this   -- messed up,'' Michael said.  Residents Jean and Jerry Isaacs said they had canceled plans to   spend a few days in Florida.  ``We could get over okay today, but by the way things are going,   it'll be tough getting back,'' Jean Isaacs said.  Elsewhere, Floyd was joined Sunday by Tropical Storm Gert, which   formed midway between Africa and Barbados. Forecasters said it was  gathering strength quickly and could become a hurricane Sunday  night or Monday.

(AP) -- Heavy rain began falling along the Gulf Coast on Saturday as Hurricane Gordon bore down on central Florida. The storm had deluged Cuba with up to 10 inches of rain before reaching hurricane strength with 75 mph winds Saturday.    Gordon was expected to strike land between Fort Myers and the Panhandle sometime late Sunday. But its unpredictability and direction changes left forecasters urging all coastal areas from Florida to Alabama to closely monitor its progress.    Florida Gov. Jeb Bush put emergency response teams on standby Saturday, and in some counties, disaster officials recommended voluntary evacuation of barrier islands and areas prone to flooding. Coastal areas were told to anticipate a storm surge.    ''It's gonna be a nuisance, bringing a lot of rain, possible flooding along the Gulf Coast with storm surge and possible tornadoes,'' said Chris Robbins, a meteorologist at the National Hurricane Center in Miami.    The center's tropical storm warning Saturday covered a 210-mile stretch from Bonita Beach, just south of Fort Myers, to the Suwannee River, about 100 miles north of Tampa.    A hurricane watch was issued for a 400-mile stretch from Bonita Beach to the Panhandle town of Apalachicola. The watch means a storm with winds of 74 mph or greater could hit within the next 36 hours.    As skies grayed over the Tampa Bay area Saturday, people didn't seem too concerned about the approaching storm. Along Clearwater Beach, only a few homeowners had boarded up their windows.    Joel Nava of Tampa and Jim Phillips of Clearwater bought 15 50-pound bags of potting soil to use as sandbags. Both live in low lying areas and said they planned to barricade their front doorways with the potting soil to keep flood water out.    Richard Lehfeldt recently moved to Tampa from New York City and wasn't sure what to expect. He bought plastic weatherproofing to cover windows of his house, duct tape, batteries and flashlights -- just in case. ''I'll secure parts of the house that are vulnerable, then watch TV,'' he said.    Robbins, the meteorologist, said people shouldn't panic.    ''It is a minimal hurricane,'' he said. ''Of course, I don't want to minimize its importance.''    Saturday evening, Gordon was about 235 miles southwest of Tampa and moving north-northeast at about 12 mph, a slight shift to the north from earlier in the day when the storm was headed northeasterly.    Two to five inches of rain were expected to fall across parts of South Florida and the Keys on Saturday.    Disaster officials in Hernando, Manatee and Pinellas counties told residents who wanted to leave to start packing and that shelters would be opened in the evening. Other counties were awaiting later forecasts before deciding whether to advise evacuation.    Across the state on the Atlantic Coast, NASA considered moving the space shuttle Discovery off its seaside launch pad at Cape Canaveral and into its hangar. Discovery is scheduled to blast off Oct. 5 on a space station construction mission.    A Sunday baseball game between Oakland and Tampa was also postponed as a precaution.    In addition to Gordon's rainfall in Cuba early Saturday, the storm pounded Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula on Friday, causing street flooding in the resort city of Cancun.    In the Atlantic, wind blew across Bermuda at 60 mph early Saturday as Hurricane Florence passed north of the island. There was no damage or flooding, said James Buxton, meteorologist with the Bermuda Weather Service. Florence, down-graded to a tropical storm, was 510 miles southeast of Halifax, Nova Scotia, Saturday evening with sustained winds of 70 mph and was expected to pass near eastern Newfoundland on Sunday.    Rip currents associated with Florence were blamed for at least three surf deaths Tuesday in North Carolina.    Near its center, Florence still packed hurricane force winds of 80 mph but some weakening was forecast in the next day and the storm

DEBUG:simuser.search.interfaces.pyterrier:raw text: &HT;    Baker Clark doesn't need any weather expert to remind him that hurricane season begins Tuesday.    He keeps a photo album under the reception counter at the Five Flags Inn filled with scenes of terrible destruction from 1995's Hurricane Opal, which devastated his 49-room motel and 100 miles of Panhandle beaches.    ``My family has owned this motel since 1965 and we've seen hurricanes before,'' he said, paging through the photos of sand-filled rooms and twisted debris. ``But it seems like we've had more than our share lately.''    Experts confirm his observation, saying the crowded Atlantic and Gulf coastlines could be in for a cycle of punishing storm activity that could last years _ even decades.    ``People have been saying ... we may be heading back to a period like the '40s and '50s when we really had heavy hurricane seasons with a lot of major hurricanes,'' says National Hurricane Center Director Jerry Jarrell. ``I think it's no longer speculation. I think we are in it now.''    The numbers bear him out: 1995 to 1998 was the most active four-year stretch on record, spawning 53 named storms in the Atlantic basin, with 33 hurricanes and 15 of those reaching major status. Storms are named when winds reach 39 mph, become hurricanes at 74 mph and are deemed major at 111 mph.    Many of the long-term predictions are based on research by William Gray, a Colorado State University forecaster who tracks tropical systems and the forces that create them.    Gray's 1999 forecast, which will be updated this week, calls for 14 named Atlantic storms this year, with 10 reaching hurricane strength and four growing into major storms.    Perhaps most worrisome: Because of a complex mix of factors, Gray thinks the Gulf Coast has a 150 percent greater chance of being hit by a major storm than in a statistically average year, while the Atlantic Coast has double the chance.    Powerful storms like Opal and last year's Mitch and Georges have always done the most damage. But unlike the last period of high hurricane activity, from roughly 1940 to 1960, the population of the nation's eastern coastline has swelled.    ``There's such a buildup of population and property values along the Southeastern coast,'' Gray told The Associated Press. ``You're going to see hurricane damage like you've never previously seen it because there's just so much more there.''    Panhandle residents know about the damage firsthand.    Hit by powerful Hurricane Frederic in 1979, the region escaped major hurricane damage the next 15 years, which also was a time of unprecedented growth. High-rise condos, golf resorts, marinas and new neighborhoods sprouted from Gulf Shores, Ala., to Panama City Beach, Fla. Even the long-neglected Mississippi coast boomed in the 1990s with the advent of casinos.    The hurricane drought ended in 1995, when Erin slashed across the region, leaving significant damage. Four months later Opal roared ashore with winds approaching 150 mph, leveling homes, tearing up docks, snapping power lines and eating away dunes.    Last year, first Earl and then Georges came calling, once again filling streets with sand, blowing out windows and undermining foundations. Georges also pummeled several Caribbean islands and the Florida Keys.    The repeated storms scoured away sand dunes along much of the Gulf Coast, leaving buildings exposed to sea water. Governments scrambled to rebuild the dunes, pumping sand from offshore, setting up sand fences and planting sea oats to hold the dunes in place.    But the work can't compare to the slow, natural process of dune building.    ``Our sand dunes used to be so high you couldn't even see the water from here,'' Clark said, pointing out his office window to a pool deck that drops directly to a flat beach. ``They renourished our beach after Opal, but last year Georges took all that sand offshore. Now there's nothing out there to protect us.''    Gray thinks the weather patterns that control hurricanes have shifted, part of a long-term cycle that s

But the hurricane, named Earl, spared the state major damage before moving into Georgia and the Carolinas as a weaker storm.    One person was killed near St. Helena Island in South Carolina in a tornado spawned by the storm, emergency officials said. In Florida, the bodies of two fishermen were found off Panama City, one on a beach near the town and the other 10 miles at sea. Injuries were few and mostly minor, Florida officials said.    Downgraded to a tropical storm, the storm was traveling through the southeastern states with sustained winds of 45 miles an hour and was expected to stay inland through Friday.    ``Considering the size of the storm and how erratic it was, for the most part we got out pretty well,'' said Ann Rowe, a spokeswoman with the Florida Division of Emergency Management.    Rated as a Category 1 hurricane, the mildest classification, Earl approached with menacing winds of 100 miles an hour but lost some of that punch as it went ashore near Panama City, a beach area of about 35,000 residents that bulges with tourists in the summer. But it was storm surges of 7 to 12 feet that caused the most damage, state officials said.    Sixteen counties along the coast south and southwest of Tallahassee reported heavy beach erosion, damage to more than 1,100 homes, submerged coastal roads and more than 15,000 residents without electric power. Six counties reported tornadoes.    Residents who wanted to return home on Thursday after being evacuated were sometimes blocked by impassable roads. Gov. Lawton Chiles, who asked the federal government for a disaster declaration to insure financial aid, said most damage was caused by flooding and a surge that some residents said was worse than previous hurricanes that have pounded the area recently. Comprehensive damage reports were note expected for a day or so.    ``It looks like we got quite a bit of water,'' the governor said at a news briefing.    But state tourism officials said the hurricane caused ``little to no damage'' to tourist destinations of the Panhandle. Panama City, Destin, Pensacola and Fort Walton Beach all had reported favorable conditions for travel during the upcoming Labor Day weekend, they said, and beaches, golf courses and campgrounds were open.    The scene was less relaxing in areas like Shell Island, a small community in Wakulla County, where 26 boats, ranging from small fishing vessels to large cabin cruisers, washed away from a marina and were bobbing atop the water in front lawns.

Readies For Another Hurricane  Hurricane Irene continued to track toward North Carolina on Sunday, bringing the potential for more  flooding to the storm-weary state.  Officials reported no sustained tropical-force winds on land   before dawn on Sunday. Sustained winds near 50 mph were clocked  over coastal waters. Still, Irene continued to maintain sustained  winds of 75 mph -- just above the threshold for a hurricane.  Topsail Beach northeast of Wilmington was ordered evacuated   Sunday morning. Nearby Onslow Beach, under the Marine Corps'  jurisdiction, was closed as well. A steady rain fell across the  southeast quarter of the state.  Late Saturday, evacuation orders were issued for Sunset Beach   and Ocean Isle along North Carolina's southern coast, and on Sunday  no one was being permitted on nearby Oak Island, where Hurricane  Floyd came ashore last month, Brunswick County emergency management  officials said.  At 8 a.m. EDT Sunday, the center of the storm was about 115   miles south of Charleston, S.C., moving north at 10 mph. A gradual  turn toward the north-northeast, along with an increase in speed,  was forecast for later Sunday.  Projections from the National Hurricane Center put the ragged   eye of the storm near Cape Romain, just northeast of Charleston, by  Sunday afternoon. It was expected to make landfall near the North  Carolina-South Carolina state line late Sunday.  A hurricane warning was in effect from Savannah, Ga., to Cape   Hatteras, N.C., and a tropical storm warning was posted for north  of Cape Hatteras to the Virginia line and from St. Augustine Beach,  Fla., to Savannah, Ga.  With a state of emergency declared by Gov. Jim Hunt for eastern   North Carolina, officials warned that it wouldn't take much rain to  push rivers in the eastern part of the state back above flood  stages. A flood watch was posted for eastern North Carolina, which  forecasters said could receive 3 to 6 inches of rain. Irene's winds  also could threaten camper villages populated by those left  homeless by floods from Hurricane Floyd.  ``We just got into the mobile homes, the travel trailers,'' said   Dorothy Murphy, among those to seek shelter Saturday night in the  Pitt County jail gymnasium. ``Now we got to uproot again.''  North Carolina also mobilized 300 National Guard troops Saturday   to prepare for the recovery effort, and Eric Tolbert, North  Carolina's emergency management director, said many supplies are  already in place because of the recovery effort from Hurricane  Floyd.  ``I'm a little concerned about personnel resources being   strained,'' Tolbert said. ``Our personnel are obviously tired.''  So far, Irene has been blamed for at least seven deaths -- two in   Cuba and five people near Fort Lauderdale, Fla., who were  electrocuted by downed power lines. After drenching Cuba's tobacco  fields and collapsing buildings in Havana, the storm rolled ashore  Friday afternoon 75 miles southwest of Miami and headed north  through the Everglades.  At its worst, the storm knocked out power to more than 1.5   million customers, according to Florida Power &AMP; Light, the state's  largest utility. Electricity was restored to about half of them by  midday Saturday. As much as 18 inches of wind-driven rain caused  scattered flooding over hundreds of miles, from Key West to West  Palm Beach.  Miami-Dade Mayor Alex Penelas said crop damage could total $100   million. ``It seems about every piece of farm land is literally  under water,'' he said.  It was a month ago Saturday that thousands of coastal residents   returned home after fleeing Hurricane Floyd, which destroyed than  6,000 buildings and damaged 9,000 others. At least 49 deaths and  damage expected to exceed Hurricane Fran's record $6 billion in  1996 were blamed on the huge storm.

The Keys, hard hit by Hurricane Georges, were under siege again.    By the time Mitch's center made landfall Thursday morning, the region had been lashed with thunderous rain, whipping winds and occasional twisters for hours.    The Keys, the chain of islands at the state's southern tip, were hit especially hard. Mobile homes flipped, a motel's roof ripped off, trees fell and power lines snapped in the same areas where Hurricane Georges left damage in September.    There were multiple tornado touchdowns in Key Largo on Wednesday and at one touchdown in Islamorada, said Becky Herrin, a spokeswoman for the Monroe County Sheriff's Office. ``It took the roof off the Hampton Inn _ most of the roof, anyway.''    Farther north, ``a bunch of trailers turned over and people were trapped inside. We had to go trailer to trailer getting people out,'' she said.    Seven people were treated for storm-related injuries, mostly cuts and scrapes, at Mariner's Hospital on Plantation Key on Wednesday.    A U.S. Coast Guard helicopter rescued a man and a woman Wednesday after their boat sunk amid 6-to-8 foot (2-to-3 meter) swells in the Atlantic Ocean about 52 miles (84 kilometers) east of West Palm Beach. The two U.S. citizens, who were not identified, were found in a life raft and taken to a hospital in the Bahamas, said Lt. Javier Delgado. Their conditions were not immediately available.    Television news reports showed snapped trees in southern Broward County.    The storm was expected to move over the state and out over the Atlantic by this afternoon. Rainfall totals of 4 to 8 inches (10 to 20 centimeters) were forecast.    Flooding was reported on many streets in the region, slowing morning commuters in the Miami area.    A tropical storm warning was in effect, extending from the Florida Keys north to Tarpon Springs on Florida's Gulf coast, and north to New Smyrna Beach on the Atlantic coast. Western Cuba also was under a tropical storm warning, as were the northwestern Bahamas.    At (1200 GMT), Mitch had top sustained winds near 55 mph (89 kph), with gusts as high as 69 mph (111 kph). The storm was centered just south-southeast of Naples on the state's southern Gulf coast. The storm was moving to the east-northeast at near 23 mph (37 kph) and was expected to pick up speed. Forecasters said it was a good thing that the storm was moving rapidly; rainfall totals would have been higher if the storm was moving more slowly.

For a time Monday, a portion of I-10 near the Alabama line was under water, as more than 20 inches of rain were recorded in the Panhandle.    Creeks were overflowing their banks and officials were worried that rivers in the western Panhandle would begin flooding in the next several days.    Gulf Power Co. crews worked to restore electrical service to 90,000 homes and businesses in Escambia, Santa Rosa and Okaloosa counties. Most schools and government offices were closed Monday.    Georges was the second storm in three weeks to cause relatively modest damage to the area. Hurricane Earl brought category 1, 80 mph winds to Panama City Beach Sept. 3 before shattering into a tropical storm shortly after landfall.    Neither Earl nor George appeared to have caused nearly the damage brought by the back-to-back hurricanes of Erin and Opal three years ago.    By Monday afternoon, the Pensacola area began to return to normal, as winds subsided but the steady rain continued.    The Pensacola Bay Bridge _ linking the mainland with Gulf Breeze _ opened in the afternoon. The Bob Sikes Bridge, connecting Gulf Breeze with the beaches, was opened till early evening for residents.    Some low-lying streets in downtown Pensacola flooded after more than 15 inches of rain fell and another 10 inches could come today, said Suzanne Kahn, spokeswoman for the Escambia County Emergency Operations Center.    Kahn said the dunes were breached in some spots.    A tornado-like waterspout Monday came ashore near Panama City Beach, nearly 200 miles east of Pensacola, and destroyed five homes and damaged seven, but no one was injured, said Bay County spokesman Charles Goodman.    A fire late Sunday took the life of a Pensacola woman in the midst of heavy rain and tropical storm-force winds. Pensacola police said the woman, Ruby Lee Pittiway, 66, is believed to have been lighting a candle when her house caught fire. There was no power at the time because of Georges.    Also in Pensacola, the roof of a downtown building caved in while three other structures suffered lesser damage, including broken windows at McGuire's Irish Pub, one of the city's best-known restaurants.    National Guard troops worked Sunday night and early Monday, at the storm's height, to rescue more than 200 people stranded in their homes by flash floods.

Bonnie strengthened into the Atlantic season's first hurricane Saturday, a 300-mile-long (480-kilometer-long) storm dwarfing sparsely populated Bahamian islands on its route, that could threaten the southeastern United States.    Another hurricane gained strength in the Pacific Ocean but was expected to peter out over open seas.    At 8 p.m. (0000 GMT) Saturday, the National Hurricane Center said Bonnie's center was located about 210 miles (335 kilometers) east-southeast of San Salvador in the Bahamas, the island where Columbus is believed to have first landed in the hemisphere.    Maximum sustained winds were estimated to have increased to near 95 mph (155 kph) and the hurricane was expected to grow stronger during the next 24 hours, the meteorologists said.    ``People along the southeastern U.S. should pay attention to its progress,'' said Jerry Jarrell, director of the hurricane center.    He said Bonnie could eventually strengthen to a Category 3 storm with winds more than 111 mph (178 kph) capable of causing extensive damage.    Though the hurricane nearly stalled for part of the day Saturday, Bonnie was expected to resume its north-northwest tack and move at 10-12 mph (16-19 kph) on Sunday, the hurricane center said.    Bahamian forecaster Basil Dean said the islands closest to the hurricane would experience waves 6 to 9 feet above normal, and Bonnie's storm surge and rain could cause local flooding.    Bahamian radio warned the islands' fishing fleet and yachters to make for safe port. The Bahamas Air-Sea Rescue Association said some U.S. yachters had turned back to Florida.    The islands' meteorological department said Bonnie would have the greatest effect on San Salvador island, which could see five to 10 inches of rain, while more populated areas, including the capital of Nassau, were unlikely to suffer as much from the storm.    Three inches of rain was reported in the Turks and Caicos Islands at the southeast end of the Bahamas chain.    Saturday evening, the hurricane warning was discontinued in the Turks and Caicos and was downgraded to a tropical storm warning in the southeastern Bahamas.    North Florida is the most likely target to be hit if the storm reaches the mainland. Still, the storm could veer out to sea and miss the U.S. coast entirely, Jarrell said.    Meanwhile, another weather system that threatened parts of Texas lost power Saturday.    All warnings were discontinued when Tropical Storm Charley weakened to a depression, though the hurricane center warned small vessels to remain in port along the northwestern Gulf of Mexico until winds and waves that reached 10 feet (3 meters) subside.    The threat of heavy rains and a storm forced the evacuation of thousands of people from oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico.    As it moved into Texas, Matagorda Island was hit the hardest with 9 inches (23 centimeters) of rain and 70 mph (110 kph) wind gusts early Saturday.

Officials in Laredo had feared that the storm would stall over the low-lying city and repeat the heavy flooding that Tropical Storm Charlie brought last year to another Texas border town, Del Rio. Instead, the storm kept moving, causing sporadic flooding in Laredo but no serious damage there.    ``We dodged a major bullet,'' said Jerry Garza, a spokesman for the city of Laredo. Garza said city officials had declared a state of emergency after the National Weather Service predicted up to 20 inches of rain, which might have caused the creeks throughout the city to overflow. ``The creeks filled up,'' Garza said, ``but it stopped raining.''    Designated Category 4, or extremely dangerous, because of its 145 mile-per-hour winds, the storm veered away from heavily populated Corpus Christi and came ashore on Sunday in Kenedy County, a rural expanse of pasture land with only 460 people. Once ashore, the storm quickly weakened and was downgraded to a tropical storm by Monday morning.    Mike Cox, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety, said officials had estimated that casualties could have been as high as 1,500 people if the storm had delivered a direct blow to Corpus Christi. Instead, it meandered westward from Kenedy County through areas with few, if any, people. The National Weather Service estimated that the storm had dropped from 25 to 35 inches of rain in Kenedy County.    ``We were very lucky,'' said Brian LaMarre, a weather service meteorologist. ``If it had landed in Corpus Christi or Houston or any populated area, it would have caused phenomenal damage. As it was, it turned out to be a rainmaker.''    As thousands of evacuees continued to return home on Tuesday from inland shelters and hotels, utility workers all but restored electricity in affected areas. The Texas Public Utility Commission reported that 3,000 people remained without power but predicted that all power would be restored by Wednesday. Nearly 3,000 people remained without telephone service.    The fatal traffic accident in Laredo occurred on Monday afternoon as heavy rains from the storm deluged the city. Officials said that a tractor-trailer truck jackknifed on a rainy, windy highway and smashed into a pickup truck. Three people in the pickup were killed, as was the driver of the tractor-trailer.    ``That accident happened right when the really heavy part of Tropical Storm Bret starting affecting Laredo,'' Garza said.

Heavy rain started falling in parts of the Bahamas today as   residents scrambled for emergency supplies, shelters opened,  schools closed and shop owners boarded up windows.  Mandatory evacuations were ordered in exposed coastal areas of   both the Bahamas and Florida's Brevard County. Workers also started  leaving NASA's Kennedy Space Center, on a barrier island standing  only 9 feet above sea level.  ``I have never been this scared about a storm,'' said Bahamas   resident Angel Chea, manager of a graphics shop, as she boarded up  her windows.  ``We need people to get ready right now, not tonight, not   tomorrow,'' said Joan Heller, a spokeswoman for Brevard County.  Because of uncertainty about the huge storm's path, a hurricane   watch area on the mainland was expanded today, reaching all the way  from the Miami area northward into Georgia, the U.S. National  Hurricane Center said in Miami.  ``It's capable of almost catastrophic destruction,'' said Todd   Kimberlain, a forecaster at the hurricane center.  Floyd had top sustained wind today of nearly 155 mph. That put   it on the verge of becoming a Category 5 storm, which features top  sustained wind of more than 156 mph and is capable of causing  extreme damage. By comparison, Hurricane Andrew had Category 4  status when it struck south Florida in 1992, killing 26 people and  causing an estimated $25 billion in damage.  However, the hurricane center said little additional   strengthening was likely by midday Tuesday.  Only two Category 5 hurricanes have struck the United States   since record-keeping began, the Labor Day Hurricane of 1935, which  destroyed the railroad connecting the Florida Keys to the mainland  and killed 423 people, and Camille in 1969, which killed 256 people  along the Gulf Coast and in Virginia.  If Floyd continued on a track toward central Florida, NASA   planned to shut down the Kennedy Space Center by midnight tonight,  leaving none of its 12,500 workers behind to ride out the storm.  The center is only 9 feet above sea level, so a storm surge as well  as wind could be a problem.  All four space shuttles were in hangars, but four   multimillion-dollar rockets were on launch pads and couldn't be  moved.  All of the northwest and central Bahamian islands were under   hurricane warnings today. A tropical storm warning was posted for  the southeastern Bahamas and the nearby British Turks and Caicos  islands.  A hurricane watch on the mainland was extended from the Miami   area northward all the way to near Brunswick, Ga.  In the middle of the watch area, Florida's Brevard County   ordered tens of thousands of people living in mobile homes and  coastal areas to evacuate beginning at 4 p.m. today.  ``There are different tracks that have been projected and we   don't come out unscathed on any of them,'' said Brevard County  spokeswoman Joan Heller.  At 2 p.m., Floyd's center was about 90 miles east of San   Salvador in the central Bahamas, and about 470 miles east-southeast  of Miami. It was headed west at nearly 15 mph, and was expected to  gradually turn to a west-northwesterly-heading by evening, with a  further turn toward the northwest on Tuesday.  Hurricane-force wind extended 105 miles from its center with   tropical storm-force wind stretching outward up to 290 miles.  Forecasters estimated storm surge conditions could reach 15 to   20 feet for the northwest Bahamas.  Floyd grew unexpectedly into a monster of a storm on Sunday.   ``I didn't expect such a very fast intensification,'' said Jerry   Jarrell, director of the National Hurricane Center. ``This is a  real surprise for us.''  Far out at sea, Gert strengthened into a hurricane today with   sustained wind increasing to 75 mph. At 11

DEBUG:simuser.search.interfaces.pyterrier:raw text: HURRICANE WATCH IS ON FOR THE SUMMER  The retreat of El Nino should mean a calmer overall hurricane season for Hawaii and the tropical Pacific, but storm watchers warn the early part of the season could see a repeat of last summer's violent tropical storms.    Monday marked the beginning of the 1998 hurricane season in the central Pacific. Hurricane season runs through Nov. 15 in the eastern Pacific and through October in the central Pacific.    Many scientists say the 1997-98 El Nino, an oceanwide warming of the Pacific's surface temperatures, is waning. Nevertheless, this El Nino, one of the biggest ever recorded, may still cause storm trouble.    The federal Climate Prediction Center forecasts above-normal water temperatures in the equatorial eastern Pacific through midsummer before approaching normal conditions by early fall.    ``Based on this forecast, there may be a tendency to have an increase in the number of tropical cyclones during the early part of the hurricane season,'' said Jim Weyman, director of the Central Pacific Hurricane Center.    But he admits there is no certainty.    ``The formation, growth, movement and dissipation of tropical cyclones are governed by many complex factors, only one of which is warm ocean water,'' Weyman said.    During last summer's hurricane season, when El Nino was developing, there were nine major tropical storm systems in the central Pacific, twice the 36-year average and the fourth highest number of tropical storms during that period.    While full-blown hurricanes are rare in Hawaii _ there have been only four this century _ they are devastating when they do hit.    On Sept. 11, 1992, Hurricane Iniki caused $1.8 billion in losses on Kauai.    ``Regardless of the number of hurricanes and tropical storms that may occur, every citizen of Hawaii should prepare for a hurricane or tropical storm because it only takes one to cause extreme devastation,'' Weyman told a briefing at the University of Hawaii at Manoa last week.    Hurricanes are more common in the eastern Pacific, with the ocean west of Mexico acting as a breeding ground for the big storms.    In a typical year, 16 or 17 tropical storms and nine hurricanes form off the west coast of Mexico, some of them moving ashore with disastrous results.    The record-breaking storm season for the eastern Pacific was a non-El Nino year, 1992, when 27 tropical cyclones rampaged around the ocean.    Unlike the hit-and-run Iniki, some hurricanes can hang around for a long time. A 1994 storm named John formed off Mexico on Aug. 11, traveled more than 4,000 miles over 31 days and reached peak winds of 170 mph.    Because John crossed the international dateline twice during its raucous journey, it changed status from hurricane to typhoon and back to hurricane. In the Atlantic and eastern Pacific east of the dateline, storms attaining sustained winds of 74 mph or higher are hurricanes; the same tropical cyclone west of the international dateline is called a typhoon.    A tropical depression, which is far more common than its bigger and nastier cousins, is an organized cluster of thunderstorms with sustained winds below 38 mph; a tropical storm is more organized, with winds between 39 and 73 mph.

Carolina  After a week of wandering off the North Carolina coast, Tropical Storm Dennis washed ashore Saturday  afternoon and dumped torrential rains through much of eastern North  Carolina.  There were no reports of significant damage or injuries.   Flooding was reported in several coastal counties, along with  scattered power outages.  The National Weather Service reported that the center of Dennis'   huge eye crossed the Core Banks shortly before 5 p.m. just south of  Cedar Island. Sustained winds for the storm were clocked at 70 mph,  just short of hurricane force, when it came ashore. Later the winds  decreased to about 60 mph  Residents of fishing villages on the marshy peninsula where the   storm hit said damage from the storm Saturday were not as bad as  Monday when it pounded them on its first pass.  ``It's like a calm period right now,'' Cecile Huneycutt of   Gloucester said as the leading edge of the storm's eye passed  through. ``We've had a lot of rain.  ``The water's everywhere,'' she said. ``Our yards are just about   under, but it's not close to getting into the house.''  Mike Addertion, emergency management coordinator for Carteret   County, said it appeared the worst was over once the storm made  landfall.  ``It's under control, I believe,'' Addertion said.   Dennis was expected to weaken rapidly as it sailed northwest   through North Carolina.  Nobody was sad to see it go after nearly two weeks off the U.S.   coast, said Stacy Stewart, a meteorologist at the National  Hurricane Center in Miami.  ``It's like a dripping faucet that won't quit and won't go   away,'' Stewart said.  Dennis has been anything but a typical storm, said Stacy Stewart   of the National Hurricane Center.  Stewart said tropical storm force or stronger winds usually   affect a single area for 12 hours or less on average. ``That  includes the approach, the center passing over, and retreating.''  ``North Carolina has been getting battered for pretty close to a   week,'' Stewart said.  Tropical storm warnings were in effect along much of the North   Carolina shoreline and extended north along the Virginia coast to  Chincoteague, Va.  Farther north, in southeastern Virginia, an apparent tornado   touched down in the city of Hampton, damaging several apartment  buildings and an assisted living center, and injuring more than a  dozen people.  Another twister hit a barn and snapped utility poles in nearby   Chesapeake, Va., police said.  At 10 p.m., Dennis was centered around New Bern and moving   northwest at about 10 mph.  Flooding closed roads farther north in Craven and Pamlico   counties. Flooding also was reported as far north as Elizabeth  City.  Floodwaters forced officials in the Beaufort County town of   Belhaven to move police operations from the police department to  the municipal building, which is on higher ground.  As Dennis headed inland, emergency management officials opened   18 shelters in nine coastal counties.  Tourists on Hatteras Island who ignored evacuation orders last   weekend found themselves stranded for a second time Saturday when  the rising wind from the approaching storm disrupted ferry service  to the mainland.  A few tourists had left the island Thursday and Friday when the   first ferries delivered emergency supplies and heavy equipment to  Hatteras and Ocracoke Island.  Engineers worked Saturday to rebuild N.C. 12, the only highway   along the low-lying, fragile Outer Banks. The highway had been open  to residents with four-wheel-drive vehicles, but was closed again  Saturday afternoon as the wind increased and torrential rain  flooded the island.  As the storm moved inland Saturday evening, 80 people took   shelter at Pamlico County Community College in Grantsboro, said Tim  Harvey, the county's emergency management coordinator.

(AP) - Most of the 800 residents in this rustic fishing town stayed put Sunday evening as Tropical Storm Gordon, with winds just below hurricane strength, plowed into central Florida's Gulf Coast.    Drenching rain, a storm surge with waves over 6 feet high and wind gust of up to 60 mph pounded this barrier reef about 100 miles north of Tampa. Gordon, with top sustained winds near 70 mph, made landfall at about 8 p.m. Sunday EDT.    No injuries or deaths were reported as of early Monday as the system began making its way across Florida. The storm's forecast track had it moving over coastal Georgia and the Carolinas.    About 200 Florida National Guardsmen were activated and field teams were deployed to assess damage at first daylight. State officials announced that schools in Columbia, Taylor, Citrus and Gilchrist counties would be closed Monday.    At 2 a.m. EDT, Gordon's center was near 29.8 north latitude, 82.8 west longitude, or about 30 miles west-northwest of Gainesville. The storm was moving north-northeast near 12 mph with top sustained winds near 50 mph, but was forecast to weaken as it travels overland.    A voluntary evacuation had been recommended in Cedar Key before the storm came ashore, but many residents preferred to wait out the storm at home.    ''Their words are like, 'We've always stayed, we're staying this time,''' Mayor Heath Davis said.    The storm knocked out electricity to much of the city earlier Sunday, but most residents had power restored by midnight. Debris and broken tree limbs littered the empty streets.    ''It was a pleasant surprise because it could have gotten stronger out there,'' said Dan Sandsler, 41, whose family owns a waterfront restaurant and bar. ''It was disorganized before it got here, so we kind of dodged the bullet here.''    A total of about 121,000 homes throughout the state were hit with power outages, as leading bands of the storm brought heavy rains ashore over central Florida's Gulf Coast. The state's two largest utilities were working to restore power to customers Sunday evening.    Flooding was reported in southwest Florida, said Michael Loehr, operations chief for the State Emergency Operations Center.    ''We've already gotten calls from Charlotte County saying they've got houses on the coast where you open the front door, the water's coming in; you open the back door, water's going out,'' he said.    Gordon's top sustained winds fell from 75 mph early Sunday to about 70 mph by late afternoon, just below the 74 mph threshold for a hurricane.    The storm weakened as it neared land and also pulled in dry air from the Gulf of Mexico and southeastern United States, said Hugh Cobb, a meteorologist at the National Hurricane Center in Miami.    ''We came out good I think, we were very fortunate,'' said Frances Nesbitt, a Cedar Keys real estate agent. ''I'm not for hurricanes by any means, but Florida's been having a drought. The only good thing it does, it raises the water level.''    Forecasters said a storm surge of 5 to 8 feet would lessen by Monday morning. Cedar Key sits two to three feet above sea level.    There was a threat of isolated tornadoes near the east coast of Georgia on Monday morning, forecasters said. At least one tornado was reported Sunday evening in Palm Beach County, the National Weather Service said.    State officials reported about 750 people were taking advantage of shelters around the state, dozens of flights were canceled at Tampa International Airport, and the Tampa Bay Devil Rays baseball game with the Oakland A's was called off.    Evacuations were ordered for low-lying areas and mobile home parks in Citrus and Taylor Counties north of Tampa, and five counties - Pinellas, Hillsborough, Manatee, Hernando and Pasco - were under voluntary evacuation.    A tropical storm warning was still in effect for the Florida Gulf Coast from Anclote Key to St. Marks, and on the Atlantic coast from Flagl

With the peak  period about to begin, meteorologists are predicting more storms  than usual.  Scientists say three or more intense Atlantic storms are   possible, and residents living along the East and Gulf coasts  should remain prepared.  Last year's hurricane season produced 14 tropical storms,   including three major hurricanes. In a typical season, the United  States experiences five to six hurricanes, two of which are severe  and an average of 1.5 storms make landfall.  ``Just because we haven't seen a hurricane yet this year, don't   get fooled into thinking that this will be a light season'', said  Gerald Bell, a research meteorologist at National Oceanic and  Atmospheric Administration's Climate Prediction Center.  Hurricane season officially runs from June 1 to Nov. 30, but   tropical storms don't really rev up until mid-August. The peak  period runs from mid-August to mid-October.  The season is expected to be busy due to atmospheric conditions   globally that contribute to hurricanes, said CPC meteorologist  Vernon Kousky. Among those conditions are a low wind shear across  the tropical Atlantic and below-average air pressure across the  tropical Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea.  ``The odds are tilted in the favor of more storms than normal,''   said Kousky.  Hurricane expert William Gray of Colorado State University has   gone a step further, predicting 14 named tropical storms, nine  hurricanes and four intense hurricanes. Gray figures there is a 54  percent chance that one or more intense storms with wind speeds of  111 miles per hour or more will hit the East Coast and a 40 percent  chance for the Gulf Coast.  So far this season, there has been one tropical storm, Arlene,   in June.  A tropical storm carries winds of 39 to 73 mph. A tropical storm   becomes a hurricane when sustained winds reach 74 mph.

DEBUG:simuser.search.interfaces.pyterrier:raw text: MITCH EXPLODES MYTHS ABOUT HURRICANES, SHOWS NEED TO RE-EVALUATE WARNING SYSTEMS  With a major mountain range and 150 miles lying between them and the Caribbean Sea, the people of this quaint colonial village never thought they would be hit by Hurricane Mitch.    They were wrong.    Torrential rains carried by Mitch swelled the Pespire River and swept away an entire neighborhood of 300 homes in the lower part of town.    At least 15 people died in the hamlets that lie in the hills outside town, where warnings of the storm couldn't get through.    ``We thought we were too far away to have all this damage,'' said Pedro Martel, a native of Pespire, a town with tidy cobblestone streets, adobe homes and a gleaming white church. ``We're close to the Pacific, not the Caribbean'' where Mitch stalled for days just off the Honduras coast.    The people of Pespire weren't the only ones caught off-guard. By reaching at least 200 miles inland and wreaking havoc in the mountains of southern Honduras and northern Nicaragua, Mitch exploded a number of myths about hurricanes.    Conventional wisdom suggests that hurricanes do most of their damage when heavy winds attack the coastline. But Mitch and a number of other recent hurricanes show that storm systems can sometimes be more deadly when heavy rains fall in mountains hundreds of miles inland.    After watching the devastation from Mitch, even some of the world's top hurricane experts acknowledge they may need to re-evaluate how they go about warning people of potential destruction.    ``We're still a little anchored to this idea that the first thing is to get people away from the coast,'' said Jerry Jarrell, the director of the National Hurricane Center in Miami.    The potential for massive death in the highlands is ``probably an issue that gets overlooked,'' he said, noting that after watching the effect of Mitch he will begin think of possible changes to the way the service warns about hurricanes.    Not only did Mitch cause most of its damage after it had been downgraded from a hurricane to a tropical storm, but it also killed more than 4,000 people in neighboring Nicaragua, a country that received little direct warning of the catastrophic flooding coming its way. ``We didn't think it was going to come to Nicaragua,'' said Mauricio Rosales, the head of the Nicaraguan government's meteorology department. ``They U.S. hurricane officials didn't warn us.''    Jarrell acknowledges that Nicaragua might not have received enough attention. ``I'm not sure we did that much for them,'' he said.    Still, no one can say that the National Hurricane Center ignored the potential for problems in the hills.    While predicting that the storm would likely move northwest toward Belize or Mexico, the service also gave ample warning about possible problems in the hills.    One early warning from Oct. 27 noted that heavy rains in the mountains of Honduras and other parts of Central American ``could cause life-threatening flash floods and mud slides.''    Moreover, U.S. hurricane experts note that each nation has responsibility to warn its own citizens, and weather experts within the country need to study how a storm might affect their own territory.    ``These things vary depending on the country,'' said Chris Landsea, a hurricane researcher at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association. ``The individual weather services need to tailor their advisories based on their own terrain.''    Though it is funded entirely by U.S. taxpayers, the National Hurricane Center provides storm-warning services to all of the Caribbean and Latin America under an international system.    In other parts of the world, Japan, Australia, India and other countries share in paying for the monitoring system.    Jarrell said the system was established under U.S. leadership because other countries simply couldn't afford the sophisticated satellites and airborne reconnaissance required to predict hurricane movements.    The United States is required to give

A hurricane warning along the North Carolina coast was   downgraded to a tropical storm warning but forecasters said it was  too early to write off Dennis completely.  Dennis, almost stationary this morning, could linger without   moving much through Saturday, said Rod Gonski, forecaster at the  National Weather Service office in Raleigh. ``It likes that moist,  warm air on the Gulf Stream, and that's where it's centered now,''  he said.  If it starts moving again, it's just as likely to head south or   southwest as it is to reverse course toward the Outer Banks or  southeastern Virginia, Gonski said.  ``There's a chance it could come back, a little less than 50-50,   but certainly worth talking about for sure,'' he said. ``There is  nothing nudging it out in the ocean right now.''  Because of the uncertainty about the storm, people have started   calling oceanfront hotels in southeastern Virginia to cancel  reservations for Labor Day weekend.  Dennis ``puts a lot of things into sort of a holding pattern,''   said Jimmy Capps, president of the Virginia Beach Hotel-Motel  Association. ``What we probably need to do is give it another day  and see where it's going to be.''  At 11 a.m. today, Dennis was nearly stationary about 150 miles   east of Cape Hatteras, the National Hurricane Center said. Its  motion was expected to continue to be slow and erratic at least  into Wednesday morning. Its maximum sustained wind had slowed to  about 75 mph, barely above the minimum wind speed for a hurricane.  In addition to North Carolina, the tropical storm warning   stretched northward to Chincoteague, Va., and a gale warning  extended from there to Great Egg Inlet, N.J.  For a time Monday, it seemed yet another hurricane might cross   Cape Fear, directly south of Wilmington, just like Bertha and Fran  in 1996 and Bonnie in 1998. Fran killed 25 people and caused up to  $6 billion in damage.  But just as Dennis approached the Outer Banks, it began edging   away.  The storm's eye stayed 60 miles from shore, but it still   pummeled the coast with high wind and up to 8 inches of rain.  Two people died Monday in Onslow County in a head-on car   collision blamed on poor visibility from wind and rain. A surfer's  death Saturday at St. Augustine Beach, Fla., was attributed to  heavy surf from Dennis.  In Dare County, a Coast Guard helicopter rescued four men from a   small boat that was blown into a marsh after its engine failed in  the 30-foot surf.  On Hatteras Island, the ocean washed out Route 12, the only   highway along the narrow barrier island. Part of the road was  closed near Kitty Hawk and up to 3 feet of sand covered the  highway.  Farther south, the community of Cedar Island in Carteret County   was cut off by high water, and Ocracoke Island was drenched by rain  and waves.  ``The whole village was covered with water ... 6 feet above sea   level,'' Hyde County Manager Jeff Credle said of the town of  Ocracoke.  Damage on Ocracoke Island can't be estimated until the water   recedes, he said.  Cindy Babbitt rode out the storm in her Hatteras Landing Marina,   just across the inlet from Ocracoke. ``We're faring OK,'' she said.  ``I tried to look outside, but the rain is so sideways I can't  see.''  Storm damage was light. New Hanover's losses totaled $217,000,   while in Brunswick County, the collapse of a beachfront house at  Ocean Isle Beach was the worst property damage reported, said Cecil  Logan of the county emergency management office.  Utility companies said about 67,000 customers in coastal and   inland counties lost power. The outages stretched as far i

DEBUG:simuser.search.interfaces.pyterrier:raw text: Georges plows into Dominican Republic after raging through Puerto After plowing through the northern Caribbean, Hurricane Georges carved into the Dominican Republic on Tuesday, uprooting trees and churning the sea as Dominicans and tourists alike fled to shelter.    The mammoth storm was on a trajectory that could send it crashing into the Florida Keys by late Thursday or early Friday. Authorities urged tourists to leave the island chain, as residents began boarding up windows in anticipation of Georges' fury.    The storm caught the Dominican capital of Santo Domingo almost entirely unprepared Tuesday. Forecasters had expected it to hit only the northern coast, but Georges, which killed at least 10 people in its furious march across the Caribbean, changed course and headed straight for the tropical capital of 3 million people.    Even more than in Puerto Rico, where Georges exploded shop and car windows, flipped small airplanes and whisked away satellite dishes, the damage was expected to be extensive.    In this poor U.S. territory where the minimum wage is about dlrs 140 a month, the wooden houses that line riverbeds and hillsides would be no match for the storm's 110 mph (175 kph) winds.    In neighboring Haiti, which shares the island of Hispaniola and is also in the storm's path, people prepared to battle the hurricane amid even more profound poverty.    As the darkness approached, Dominican President Leonel Fernandez told his countrymen the island's fate was in God's hands.    ``For the moment, the only thing left for us to do is to raise our prayers to the Almighty,'' said the president.    Hurricane warnings were in effect from the Dominican Republic to eastern Cuba and the southeastern Bahamas. The U.S. National Weather Service said a hurricane watch may be needed late Tuesday or early Wednesday for the northwest Bahamas and South Florida.    David Chorney, a meteorologist at the National Hurricane Center in Miami, said there was ``a pretty good probability'' that Georges would hit Florida.    ``As far as intensity, it's still too early to tell what it's going to do,'' he said. After crossing the Caribbean islands and getting back over water, he said, ``there's a good chance it could redevelop and strengthen again.''    The storm had already caused what is expected to amount to hundreds of millions of dollars in damage in Puerto Rico, where the entire island lost power and most had their water cut. Five people were killed on the island and tens of thousands took refuge in shelters.    In the capital of San Juan, where almost half the island's people live, downed power lines and trees fell onto flooded roads, making some impassable.    On Tuesday, residents began the sobering task of recovery.    ``After the storm is always the worst,'' said Paula Aponte Figueroa, 71, as she swatted at mosquitoes in the musty heat, the roof of her house ripped off by the winds. ``There's flooding, there are mosquitoes and I have nowhere to go.''    The strength of Georges' winds was evident as it ripped the roof off the cab of a water tanker truck passing through Santo Domingo, flipping it onto the hood of the vehicle. The driver continued on, hanging out the window to see where he was going.    Some people stood in whipping winds Tuesday morning trying to nail plywood boards over their windows. Many residents simply sat back and waited.    Authorities in Santo Domingo didn't open shelters until Tuesday morning, hours after strong winds and heavy bursts of rain had reached the capital. People continued to stream into shelters even as the full force of Georges hit.    Power went out even before the full force of the hurricane hit.

Carolina  After a week of wandering off the North Carolina coast, Tropical Storm Dennis washed ashore Saturday  afternoon and dumped torrential rains through much of eastern North  Carolina.  There were no reports of significant damage or injuries.   Flooding was reported in several coastal counties, along with  scattered power outages.  The National Weather Service reported that the center of Dennis'   huge eye crossed the Core Banks shortly before 5 p.m. just south of  Cedar Island. Sustained winds for the storm were clocked at 70 mph,  just short of hurricane force, when it came ashore. Later in the  night maximum sustained winds decreased to about 50 mph  Residents of fishing villages on the marshy peninsula where the   storm hit said damage from the storm Saturday were not as bad as  Monday when it pounded them on its first pass.  ``It's like a calm period right now,'' Cecile Huneycutt of   Gloucester said as the leading edge of the storm's eye passed  through. ``We've had a lot of rain.  ``The water's everywhere,'' she said. ``Our yards are just about   under, but it's not close to getting into the house.''  Mike Addertion, emergency management coordinator for Carteret   County, said it appeared the worst was over once the storm made  landfall.  ``It's under control, I believe,'' Addertion said.   Dennis was expected to weaken rapidly as it sailed northwest   through North Carolina.  Nobody was sad to see it go after nearly two weeks off the U.S.   coast, said Stacy Stewart, a meteorologist at the National  Hurricane Center in Miami.  ``It's like a dripping faucet that won't quit and won't go   away,'' Stewart said.  Dennis has been anything but a typical storm, said Stacy Stewart   of the National Hurricane Center.  Stewart said tropical storm force or stronger winds usually   affect a single area for 12 hours or less on average. ``That  includes the approach, the center passing over, and retreating.''  ``North Carolina has been getting battered for pretty close to a   week,'' Stewart said.  Tropical storm warnings were in effect along much of the North   Carolina shoreline and extended north along the Virginia coast to  Chincoteague, Va.  Farther north, in southeastern Virginia, an apparent tornado   touched down in the city of Hampton, damaging several apartment  buildings and an assisted living center, and injuring more than a  dozen people.  Another twister hit a barn and snapped utility poles in nearby   Chesapeake, Va., police said.  At 11 p.m., Dennis was centered 10 miles northwest of New Bern   and moving northwest at about 9 mph.  Flooding closed roads farther north in Craven and Pamlico   counties. Flooding also was reported as far north as Elizabeth  City.  Floodwaters forced officials in the Beaufort County town of   Belhaven to move police operations from the police department to  the municipal building, which is on higher ground.  As Dennis headed inland, emergency management officials opened   18 shelters in nine coastal counties.  Tourists on Hatteras Island who ignored evacuation orders last   weekend found themselves stranded for a second time Saturday when  the rising wind from the approaching storm disrupted ferry service  to the mainland.  A few tourists had left the island Thursday and Friday when the   first ferries delivered emergency supplies and heavy equipment to  Hatteras and Ocracoke Island.  Engineers worked Saturday to rebuild N.C. 12, the only highway   along the low-lying, fragile Outer Banks. The highway had been open  to residents with four-wheel-drive vehicles, but was closed again  Saturday afternoon as the wind increased and torrential rain  flooded the island.  As the storm moved inland Saturday evening, 80 people took   shelter at Pamlico County Community College in Grantsboro, said Tim  Harvey, the county's emergency management coordinator.

As the one-time hurricane lost its punch, authorities lifted an evacuation order for the Florida Keys, and tropical storm warnings were lifted in Cuba and other Caribbean nations.    By 11 a.m. EDT, Debby's winds had dropped to about 40 mph, well below tropical storm force. Its remnants were swirling hours later between Cuba and Jamaica. Forecasters continued to watch the former hurricane for signs it might regain strength.    ''There are still some strong winds'' in that area, said forecaster Laura Salvador of the National Hurricane Center in Miami, which warned that the danger of floods in Haiti, Cuba and Jamaica continues.    Authorities had evacuated at least 7,000 people in Cuba. Heavy rains and winds lashed the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay in southeastern Cuba, home to nearly 1,600 U.S. servicemen and their families.    ''They're doing fine. They prepared for the heavy weather and lashed down anything that could become a flying object,'' said Pat Dooling, spokesman for U.S. Navy Region Southeast in Jacksonville, Florida, which oversees the Guantanamo Bay base.    Feared mudslides in Haiti's deforested northern mountains didn't happen Thursday. ''We're relieved it's all over,'' said Jacques Louis Henry, owner of the private Radio Etincelle in Port-de-Paix.    Authorities in the Dominican Republic said more than 700 people had been forced out of their homes by flooding Wednesday, but Debby caused little damage to Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and small northeast Caribbean islands.    Rains ''continue to be the most significant factor in this storm,'' for drought-stricken Cuba, the government station Radio Reloj reported. It has been the driest summer in a decade.

Tropical Storm Emily joined Dennis and Cindy, taking forecasters   by surprise with her strength.  ``I don't understand what's happening out there, but things are   popping,'' said Jerry Jarrell, director of the National Hurricane  Center in Miami.  The government of the Bahamas issued a tropical storm warning   Tuesday for the Turks and Caicos Islands and for the southeastern  Bahamas.  Tropical Storm Dennis could threaten the eastern United States   as early as Friday. At 2 a.m. Wednesday, Dennis was centered about  75 miles north of the Caicos islands.  Some strengthening was forecast through Wednesday, and it was   expected to become a hurricane in the next day or so, according to  the hurricane center.  ``We think Dennis will turn up the east coast and with any luck   will miss everything, but it will come close enough where we'll  worry about it,'' Jarrell said. ``In three days it can be on almost  any of us.''  Emily had 65 mph winds, just shy of hurricane strength, but   those winds slowed down to 45 mph by late Tuesday. Forecasters had  not even listed the storm as a depression before the tropical storm  advisory Tuesday afternoon.  Meanwhile, far east in the Atlantic, Tropical Storm Cindy   continued moving across the open ocean.  Up until this past week, there had only been one tropical storm,   Arlene, in June.  A tropical storm carries winds of 39 to 73 mph. A tropical storm   becomes a hurricane when sustained winds reach 74 mph.

DEBUG:simuser.search.interfaces.pyterrier:raw text: &HT;    The 1999 hurricane season, which ends Tuesday, will be remembered for Floyd, the big one that got away, and Irene, the little one that didn't; for a late season hurricane that reminded us to be wary into November; and for an ominous first: five storms of Category 4 or higher in one year _ miraculously, none coming ashore at that strength.    The five storms that killed people _ none stronger than Category 2 on the Saffir-Simpson scale when they made landfall _ may have been responsible for the deaths of nearly 500 people.    After bracing for Hurricane Floyd, which threatened to be the most powerful hurricane strike on Palm Beach County and the Treasure Coast since the great 1928 storm, people were caught off guard when Irene slipped up the peninsula and drenched South Florida on Oct. 15 and 16.    As it turned out, Irene brought gusts as high as 92 mph to the Glades, but never brought hurricane-force winds across the mainland. Still, its rains _ Boynton Beach alone experienced nearly 16 inches in two days _ brought flooding that took days to dissipate. Winds and flooding caused at least $200 million in insured damages.    Irene killed seven people in South Florida, all in Broward County. A mother, her two sons and a neighbor boy were electrocuted in Weston in calf-deep water when they stepped into a puddle containing a downed power line while walking their dog during a lull in the storm. A 13-year-old Cooper City boy died when he grabbed a downed power line as he waded through 18 inches of water during the storm. And two people drowned after driving into canals next to flooded roads.    ``Irene is a reminder that October is a busy month,'' National Hurricane Center forecaster Richard Pasch said last week. ``Florida gets a lot of hurricane hits in October; we saw it frequently in the 1930s and 1940s. That's a reality check.''    Floyd was larger than life as it bore down on the Florida peninsula Sept. 12, with top sustained winds of 155 _ about the same strength as Andrew. Florida's salvation was a giant trough that forecasters said would begin steering Floyd away from shore about 24 hours ahead of projected landfall, which at the time looked more and more like downtown West Palm Beach. The storm did turn on time that night, but not before nerve-wracked residents boarded up and chewed fingernails. Procrastinators fighting for plywood caused turmoil at home improvement stores.    Floyd later straddled the coast through the Carolinas to New England, bringing catastrophic flooding to North Carolina and New Jersey and killing at least 69 people _ the largest U.S. loss of life since Agnes in 1972. Early damage estimates were at least $3 billion.    Another storm, Dennis, had come ashore in the Carolinas on Aug. 30 and gone out to sea, but returned and savaged the North Carolina coast for a week, bringing heavy rains, gale force winds and flooding. Seven people died.    As is often the case, the deadliest storm wasn't the strongest or the wettest. It wasn't even a tropical storm. A tropical depression formed off Mexico's Yucatan peninsula Oct. 4 and came ashore northeast of the coastal resort of Veracruz; that weather system and another one next to it brought torrential rains that caused flooding and mud slides that may have killed as many as 400.    Just as people were starting to take down their shutters, Lenny sprang to life in mid-November, racing from the Gulf of Mexico east through the Caribbean. It killed 13 people in the Virgin and Leeward Islands before fizzling on Sunday, only nine days before the official end of hurricane season.

At 2200 GMT Friday, Nicole's center was near 25.7 latitude, 43.2 longitude, or about 1,570 miles (2,527 kilometers) west-southwest of the Canary Islands of the African coast.    Nicole is moving west at about 12 mph (20 kph), the National Hurricane Center said.    The storm has 45 mph (72 kph) winds with higher gusts. Tropical storm force winds extend up to 105 miles (170 kilometers) for the storm's center.    Nicole, the 14th named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, formed Tuesday and intensified quickly to near hurricane strength. It weakened Thursday to a tropical depression and then became a low pressure center before regaining strength.    An impending cold front is expected to sweep the storm away, said hurricane specialist Miles Lawrence.    ``It's not threatening land, but not dissipating as fast as we previously forecast,'' Lawrence said.    A tropical depression becomes a named tropical storm when it has top sustained winds of 39 mph (63 kph). Tropical storms become hurricanes as their top sustained winds reach 74 mph (119 kph).    The annual Atlantic basin hurricane season begins June 1 and ends Nov. 30. Such a late-season storm was not unusual, hurricane experts said.

(AP) - A rapidly weakening Tropical Storm Helene sloshed ashore Friday in the Florida Panhandle, bringing bands of heavy rain but only minor damage.    Helene had dumped 7.75 inches of rain on Tallahassee by 2 p.m., flooding roads, ditches and a couple of apartment buildings, said Ann Rowe, a spokeswoman for the Florida Division of Emergency Management.    The storm spun off at least six tornados south of Tallahassee, but no significant damage was reported in the lightly populated area, officials said.    ''What storm?'' asked Charles Ingram, 62, a retired paper mill worker, at breakfast at Linda's Restaurant in Port St. Joe, which got some of the heaviest rain.    ''There's an awful lot of water standing around, which we need,'' Ingram said. ''We had a lot of lightning, a lot of rain, but not much damage. It's just business as usual. We planned for it, sandbagged and everything, but it didn't come.''    Schools throughout the Panhandle and state offices in Tallahassee had closed in anticipation of the storm. Power outages left 5,000 people in the dark and Tallahassee buses stopped running during the storm, officials said.    Helene's center made landfall with top winds near 45 mph - down from 65 mph - at about 8 a.m. near Fort Walton Beach, but the heaviest rain of up to 8 inches was 100 to 150 miles east of the center, including Tallahassee.    ''We get geared up and don't get hit; who's complaining?'' said Craig Fugate, leader of the state's emergency response team in Tallahassee.    By 2 p.m. the center of Helene, downgraded to a tropical depression with maximum sustained winds of 35 mph, was 20 miles north of Dothan, Ala. It was moving northeast at 16 mph.    Marshall Nelson, Gulf County emergency management coordinator, estimated between $100,000 to $300,000 in road and beach erosion damage at Cape San Blas.    About 130 people stayed in shelters overnight, mostly in Escambia and Santa Rosa counties, in the western end of the Panhandle.    Some flood warnings remained in effect for parts of Florida, including areas still soggy from the weekend passage of Tropical Storm Gordon. A flood watch was posted in northern Georgia. Tropical storm warnings, which had stretched from Pascagoula, Miss., to southeast of Tallahassee, were lifted after the storm made landfall.    Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Isaac, which strengthened from a depression late Thursday, was in the far eastern Atlantic on Friday and posed no threat to land. The storm, with maximum sustained winds of nearly 50 mph, moving toward the west-northwest at nearly 18 mph.    On the Net:    National Hurricane Center: http://www.nhc.noaa.gov  AP-ES-09-22-00 1604

DEBUG:simuser.search.interfaces.pyterrier:raw text: HURRICANE TOLL: MAINLY INCONVENIENCE  Two years ago, residents of this surfside resort just east of Wilmington returned to their island after the passing of Hurricane Fran and found utter devastation. Sand dunes were flattened. Beachfront houses were swamped. Boats were tossed ashore.    They found none of that Thursday as they streamed back to survey the damage from Hurricane Bonnie, which blew through this area on Wednesday afternoon. A few shingles were missing, a few dwellings and businesses had water damage.    The dunes, artificially replenished earlier this year, had lost a bit of sand. A single small boat, the Bahama Gem, had been lifted out of the marsh and deposited on a muddy bank. Even the Shell Island Resort, a beachfront condominium that is close to falling into the sea, suffered little noticeable damage.    ``We're very fortunate,'' said Ed Taylor, an assistant to the town manager.    In Brunswick County, just south of Wilmington, officials expressed amazement at the dearth of significant destruction. ``It's totally unreal, especially as big as this hurricane was and as long as it hung around,'' said Cecil Logan, a spokesman for the county's disaster services. That was the sentiment up and down the North Carolina coast Thursday as coastal residents, waterlogged but relieved, awoke to the realization that Hurricane Bonnie had not lived up to her advance notices.    Although the National Hurricane Center reported that the category 3 storm carried maximum sustained winds of 115 mph, there were few physical signs that its power had been that intense. Some longtime residents said they had developed an ear for hurricanes, and could tell from the sound of the hurricane that it would not be as destructive as Fran, which caused nearly $6 billion in property damage.    State officials said it was too early to make a dollar assessment of the damage from the latest hurricane.    Grover Gore, a 66-year-old lawyer who has lived for 33 years on the Cape Fear River in Southport, said that really bad storms would progress from whistling to howling to roaring to screeching to screaming. ``We had screeching but we didn't have as much of it as with Fran,'' he said.    As the hurricane was downgraded to a tropical storm Thursday, with winds of 70 mph slowly churning northward through eastern North Carolina, there were still no reports of deaths or serious injuries from it. Many of the injuries that were reported by area hospitals, including electric shocks and carbon monoxide poisoning, resulted from the improper use of generators.    There were, of course, plenty of ecological consequences, particularly for sand dunes and rain-sodden rivers. The Pamlico River washed over its banks in places near Washington, N.C., as did the Neuse River in New Bern, where major highways were closed. Many cities in the region received between nine and 11 inches of rainfall in the last two days.    Residents in Carolina Beach, just south of here, close to where the eye of the storm made landfall, reported that several feet of sand had washed ashore on the north end of their island.    At North Topsail Beach, early assessments indicated that 60 percent of the dunes had washed away, some in half-mile long chunks. On one end of the island, a truck was buried in sand to the tops of its tires. Boardwalks were twisted and torn away and some houses were perched precariously near the edge of the water, because of beach and dune erosion.    North Topsail Beach, with the help of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, had spent $2 million replenishing the dunes blown away by Hurricanes Fran and Bertha in 1996.    ``We're just going to have to start over again,'' said Tony Hammond, the town manager. ``The ones that had the vegetation seemed to have held up better. The ones with limited vegetation didn't do as well.''    On Thursday, President Clinton declared North Carolina a disaster area, making it eligible for federal assistance like loans to farmers and emergency assistance for food and c

At 8 a.m. EDT, the storm's center was near 14.0 north latitude   and 58.0 west longitude, about 240 miles east-southeast of Dominica  in the Leeward Islands of the Lesser Antilles.  ``The Leeward Islands are the ones that are really in threat of   being hit,'' said Michael Formosa, meteorologist at the Center.  A tropical storm warning was in effect for Barbados early   Tuesday, while a hurricane watch was in effect for the Leeward  Islands from Anguilla to Montserrat, and for St. Lucia in the  Windward Islands.  St. Vincent and the Grenadines were under a tropical storm   watch.  Puerto Rico and the U.S. and British Virgin Islands were urged   to closely monitor the storm's progress.  Grenada was no longer under a tropical storm watch early   Tuesday.  Jose was moving west-northwest near 13 mph and this motion was   expected to continue for the next 24 hours. Maximum sustained winds  were near 65 mph, with higher gusts. Tropical storm force winds  extended outward up to 60 miles.  Tropical storms become hurricanes once their top sustained winds   reach 74 mph. Jose is the 10th tropical storm of the 1999 season,  which runs from June 1 through Nov. 30.

Schools closed, people rushed to buy emergency supplies and governments prepared shelters. Tourists crowded airports to flee the storm and airlines began canceling flights. Cruise ships turned away from the winds and rain.    Ten ships and two submarines in the USS Harry Truman battle group abandoned training exercises off Vieques island and moved 300 miles south of Puerto Rico, the Navy said. Vieques is the site of recurrent protest over military exercises.    The fourth named storm of the Atlantic season emerged with unnerving suddenness as the season's first threat to land, with fears that it could directly hit the Puerto Rican capital of San Juan around noon Tuesday.    At 2 a.m. EDT Tuesday, Debby was just southeast of the island of Barbuda in the northern Leeward Islands, heading for French, Dutch and British islands overnight and expected to continue onto the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico and then the Dominican Republic. Forecasters said it was too early to say whether the storm could threaten the U.S. mainland.    Debby seemingly came out of nowhere Saturday and reached near-hurricane strength in little more than a day. Its sustained winds reached 75 mph early Tuesday, past the 74 miles per hour to be classified as a hurricane.    Debby was churning west-northwest at about 20 mph, especially fast for such a storm, and was expected to intensify and keep on the same track for the next three days. The weather service said winds were expected to reach about 86 mph.    Hurricane warnings were posted from the French island of Guadeloupe north through the island chain including Dutch St. Maarten, Saba, and St. Eustatius, through the British and U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. The Dominican Republic went on storm watch Monday night.    In volcano-plagued Montserrat, British Gov. Anthony Abbott warned in a radio broadcast that ''There's a possibility that Debby could pass right over Montserrat.''    Stormy weather likely would cause mudflows of volcanic debris down the Belham River, the Montserrat Volcano Observatory warned, though that area has been in the restricted danger zone.    Meteorologists in Antigua warned their residents to prepare for a direct hit.    Electricity on some parts of Antigua went out, apparently turned off to avoid storm damage. Motorists lined up for gas, and emergency specialists warned people living in roofless homes unrepaired since last year's hurricanes to get ready to head to shelters.    A flight by a hurricane hunter airplane Monday morning showed Debby was outpacing even the experts' forecasts.    ''It's moving faster and it's also more intense than we had thought,'' Laskosky said.    In the twin-island nation of St. Kitts and Nevis, Debby threatened to soak Carifesta, a 35-nation arts and music festival that began Thursday.    Carnival Cruise Lines said it was diverting three of its ships now in the eastern Caribbean to areas further north, west and south to avoid the storm.    In the U.S. Virgin Islands, the National Park Service shut down its grounds on the island of St. John. Boaters moored off the park were told to move to safe harbors.    Hotels were refusing new reservations as their guests tried to flee the storm.    ''Yachties'' spent the day securing boats in mangrove swamps and other relatively safe areas like Hurricane Hole on the U.S. Virgin Island of St. John.    Hotels were refusing new reservations as their guests tried to flee the storm.    ''Lots of people want to leave today but unfortunately most of the flights are already sold out,'' said travel agent Angela Belfon.

The rapidly developing storm made landfall about 6 p.m. in   sparsely populated Kenedy County, about 70 miles south of Corpus  Christi.  Authorities reported no injuries in the hours just after   landfall. No major damage was immediately apparent as the storm  moved inland Sunday night, but there was no word about largely  unpopulated areas directly in the hurricane's path.  Businesses and homes were shuttered from Brownsville to north of   Corpus Christi, and highways leading inland were packed with  bumper-to-bumper traffic for miles.  Winds of 125 mph, with gusts even higher, extended 40 miles out   from the storm. Forecasters warned about tornadoes spawned by the  storm, a foot or more of rain and a storm surge that could approach  25 feet.  The tightly focused storm had the ``clear potential of producing   major disaster,'' said Jim Hoke, director of the National Weather  Service's National Hydrometeorological Emergency Center. He  compared the storm with Hurricane Andrew, which battered Florida in  1992.  But unlike Andrew, which hit densely populated South Florida,   Bret hit between Corpus Christi (population of 275,000) and  Brownsville (132,000).  ``The good news is that the core of the hurricane ... is not   over the more populated areas,'' said Max Mayfield of the National  Hurricane Center.  The path resembles that of 1980's Hurricane Allen, which packed   winds of 185 mph and did $55 million in property damage but killed  only two people when it came ashore.  Palm trees whipped as the wind strengthened in early afternoon   and Corpus Christi Bay was covered with whitecaps as the Category 4  storm came ashore.  As the storm hit, some people braved driving rain and rolling   surf to walk on Corpus Christi beaches. A few even grabbed  surfboards or swam.  Carolina DeLeon, 23, was on the beach with her husband, Jesus,   making a videotape of the storm for their unborn daughter, Zara,  who is due in two weeks.  ``She'll probably say, 'Mom, you're crazy,'' Carolina DeLeon   said.  Corpus Christi declared a state of disaster and called for a   general but voluntary evacuation of the city of 300,000 residents,  said city spokesman Ted Nelson.  ``We are really trying to drive home the point that we take this   very seriously,'' Nelson said.  The evacuation was ``proceeding in an orderly fashion,'' Corpus   Christi City Manager David Garcia said Sunday.  Emergency officials in San Antonio set up shelters at Lackland   Air Force Base in anticipation of thousands of fleeing residents.  Families pouring into shelters were told to bring only what they  needed because of cramped quarters.  Many San Antonio hotels offered lowered evacuee rates with proof   of residence in the hurricane-chewed region.  Like monstrous Hurricane Allen, Bret hit one of the state's   least populated areas, the ranch land of Kleberg and Kenedy  counties between Brownsville and Corpus Christi. However, tropical  storm-force winds of up to 73 mph extended more than 100 miles  outward from the center, the National Hurricane Center said.  The King Ranch occupies much of Kenedy and Kleberg counties.   Ranch president Jack Hunt said about 50 people had been evacuated  but there was no way to protect about 55,000 head of cattle.  ``The cattle will just have to ride it out,'' Hunt said. ``It's   not practical to move them out.''  Most residents had left coastal Padre and Mustang islands, where   a mandatory order was issued and police went door-to-door urging  people to leave.  Gov. George W.

Debby seemingly came out of nowhere Saturday and reached near-hurricane strength in little more than a day. Its sustained winds reached 75 mph early Tuesday, past the 74 miles per hour to be classified as a hurricane.    Debby was churning west-northwest at about 20 mph, especially fast for such a storm, and was expected to intensify and keep on the same track for the next three days.

Despite predictions of a busy hurricane season, it's been a fizzle so far. So the question is: Were the forecasters way off?    Their advice: Don't start digging into the canned tuna in your hurricane supplies just yet.    ``Two words: last year,'' said hurricane forecaster Jack Beven of the National Hurricane Center in Miami. ``Last year this time, Alex, our first tropical storm, was forming. And later on we had 10 storms in 33 days.''    Colorado State University professor Bill Gray predicted at the start of the June-through-November hurricane season that 1999 might be a repeat of last year, which produced a bumper crop of violent storms.    There were 14 tropical storms in 1998, 10 of which intensified into hurricanes.    Gray and his research team said in June that conditions were right for 14 storms this season. If he's right _ and he often is _ we'll be closely watching storms named Gert, Jose, Katrina and many more.    But so far there's only been tropical storm Arlene, which bypassed Bermuda in mid-June.    Chris Landsea, a hurricane researcher for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association and a former student of Gray's, says the slow start to this year's hurricane season isn't unusual.    ``The historical average is one and a half tropical storms forming by Aug. 1, so it's pretty close to average,'' he said last week.    He said a slow start doesn't indicate that the season will be an inactive one.    In 1984 and 1988, the first hurricane didn't form until September. Diana and Debby were the fourth tropical storms in those years, but the first ones that developed hurricane-force winds of at least 74 mph. Both 1984 and 1988 produced 12 tropical storms, five of which became hurricanes.    Nine tropical storms develop in an average year, with six of them becoming hurricanes.    ``If anything, the slow start of the storms forming in the subtropics is a sign that it could be busier than usual later on,'' Landsea said.    ``It would be nice if the ones that form in the subtropics were forming more regularly, but they're not. It's another sign that later on, the Cape Verde season could be a nasty one in 1999.''    Storms referred to as Cape Verde storms develop near the Cape Verde islands off the west coast of Africa and often become the biggest and fiercest storms of the hurricane season as they gain strength sweeping across the Atlantic. They can scour the Caribbean islands, strike the United States or Mexican mainland, or curve harmlessly into the North Atlantic.    Hurricane activity peaks in mid-September. August, September and October are the three most active months, with 90 percent of all storms occurring in those months, Landsea said.    Gray will update his forecast Friday, and the NOAA plans to reassess the hurricane season next Monday.    But Landsea said he sees no obvious reasons to scrap the forecast for an active season that he and Gray predicted. Beven, with the National Hurricane Center, agrees that conditions still appear favorable for an above-normal hurricane season.    A key factor is La Nina, the abnormal cooling of water in equatorial Pacific waters. La Nina is expected to promote hurricane development through the remainder of the year. Another factor Gray takes into account is a high-pressure ridge in the North Atlantic, which also promotes hurricane formation.

Such was the case for Hurricane Mitch in October 1998 in Central America and to a lesser but still impressive degree for Hurricane Floyd during September in the eastern United States.    Scientists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration are refining new methods to chart how much rain is falling in a major tropical storm. The methods rely on satellites set up to measure various types of energy reflected by storm clouds: microwave, infrared or visible light. Since 1978, the researchers have collected satellite data, largely over the United States, that allow them to relate these energy levels to the amounts of rain measured below the clouds by rain gauges and radar. They say that the satellite estimates fall within 25 percent to 50 percent of the rain gauge results.    Even with such a large margin of error, the satellite estimates are better than nothing in areas without rain gauges, like remote mountainous regions where some of the heaviest rain occurs and where floods originate.    The information can be made available within minutes after collection and can therefore be used to provide warnings of flash floods and to assist in relief efforts.

Residents on the French island of Martinique, where the storm is   projected to pass overnight, began stockpiling water and food while  Red Cross officials went on alert in Puerto Rico, where Jose could  strike Thursday.  ``It's getting stronger, and it looks like it's going to go   through a lot of islands,'' said meteorologist Krissy Williams at  the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami. Forecasters said it  was too early to say whether Jose might threaten the U.S. East  Coast.  The 10th named storm of the season was about 110 miles east of   the island of Dominica late Tuesday night. Its winds had  strengthened to 75 mph and it was moving west-northwest at 13 mph.  Hurricane-force winds extended 25 miles to the northeast of the   center, with tropical storm force winds stretching another 115  miles.  In Pointe-a-Pitre, the capital of French Guadeloupe, residents   lined up at supermarkets before 8 a.m. Tuesday and some stores ran  out of bottled water and rice by midmorning. The island has not  been hit by a hurricane since Hugo 10 years ago.  Schools broadcast messages asking parents to pick up their   children. Homeowners boarded up windows and clambered onto roofs to  remove satellite dishes.  ``My parents lost their roof in Hugo because they didn't take   the warning seriously -- I'm going to prepare myself for all  eventualities,'' said a young man buying nails in a hardware store.  France posted hurricane alerts for Martinique, Guadeloupe, St.   Martin and St. Barthelemy. Warnings also were in effect for  Dominica, Montserrat, Antigua, Barbuda, Nevis, St. Kitts, St.  Eustatius, Saba, St. Maarten and Anguilla, Puerto Rico, and the  U.S. and British Virgin Islands. Barbados and St. Lucia were  downgraded to tropical storm warnings.  Carnival Cruise Lines said it was diverting one ship to the   Cayman Islands and Jamaica to escape the storm. American Airlines  canceled flights to Antigua from its hub in San Juan, Puerto Rico,  and warned of further cancellations Wednesday. Tourists in the U.S.  Virgin Islands were heading home, hoteliers said.  Officials in British Montserrat, struggling to rebuild from a   volcanic eruption, warned that heavy rains could create mudslides  on the ash-covered flanks of the Soufriere Hills volcano.  The Hurricane Center warned people in the Dominican Republic to   watch Jose carefully. Williams said the storm should be there by  Friday, possibly headed for the storm-battered Bahamas.  ``We're hoping a cold front through south Florida will push it   back out to the ocean, but it's pretty early to tell,'' she said.  Last year, Hurricane Georges churned through a dozen northeast   Caribbean islands then ripped through the more populated Greater  Antilles, killing more than 500 people and causing billions of  dollars of damage.

Though barely a hurricane with winds of 75 mph, the storm cut   power intermittently in this resort city as Irene's center passed  nearby during the morning. Up to 10 inches of rain flooded some  main streets and most secondary roads in Key West and two  neighboring islands.  Torrential rains pounded the lower third of the Florida   peninsula as the storm crawled across the straits separating Cuba  from the United States.  ``We're experiencing some strong tropical storm conditions right   now from Key West all the way up the Keys as far as Ocean Reef  right now,'' Billy Wagner, Monroe County Emergency Management  director, said this morning. Big Pine Key had a gust recorded at  103 mph, the National Weather Service said.  The weak hurricane was expected to come ashore on the mainland   by early evening in the Everglades, sending a 5- to 7-foot storm  surge into Key Largo, and pass over Lake Okeechobee before pushing  into the Atlantic.  Forecasters had worried about Irene sending more rain to parts   of North Carolina flooded by Hurricane Floyd, but said early this  afternoon that a shift to the east in the may spare the Carolinas  by keeping the storm off the coast.  A tropical storm warning covered 280 miles of the Atlantic   Coast, a storm warning or hurricane watch covered 235 miles along  the Gulf Coast, and a tornado watch was in effect for South  Florida. Street flooding, downed tree limbs and outages were  reported across the state.  As the storm approached, Collier County, the southernmost Gulf   Coast county on the Florida mainland, closed public schools and  government offices today. MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa arranged  to fly its six refueling tankers to safety in Kansas.  Forecasters said rainfall totals could top 15 inches.   ``It's not a well-organized hurricane, and there's a huge swath   of storms and rain to the east'' of its center, said Richard Pasch,  a hurricane specialist at the National Hurricane Center outside  Miami. In the city, there was local flooding and authorities asked  employers to send workers home early.  At 2 p.m. EDT, Irene's center was located about 25 miles   southwest of Flamingo on the southern tip of Florida's peninsula.  It was moving northeast at 10 mph.  Officials in Monroe County, which covers the Keys, ordered a   mandatory evacuation of mobile homes and recreational vehicles.  Schools were closed.  ``It's been raining throughout the night; we've been getting   quite a few inches of rain and the wind has picked up enormously  from when I came in at (midnight),'' said David Holliman, a  security guard at the Lower Keys Medical Center in Key West. ``The  trees are swaying quite a bit ... and it's getting worse.''  Four shelters were opened in the Keys: two in Key West and one   each in Marathon and Key Largo.  ``We worked all day yesterday. By the time we finished, it was   too late to go north,'' said Jose Guadarrama, a mobile home  resident who arrived at the shelter this morning.  In Key West, the collapse of a concrete seawall at the   oceanfront Key Ambassador Best Western allowed waves to wash over  the road, pulling chairs, shoes and seaweed in their wake.  ``It's like a treasure hunt out here,'' said hotel auditor   Brandon Boyce. Driving rain seeped through the roof or shutters.  ``We've got trash cans everywhere trying to catch it,'' he said.  A possible path toward eastern North Carolina had been unwelcome   news there, since rivers only recently receded below flood stage  following Hurricane Floyd's 20-inch deluge last month, blamed for  49 deaths and record damage. The state was also battered by  Hurricane Dennis less than three weeks earlier.  Irene left Cuban territory after soaking Havana on Thursday   evening. Earl

By early today, Floyd had top sustained winds of 70 mph, just 4   mph shy of hurricane strength, and was expected to increase in  strength.  Floyd, the sixth tropical storm of the season, was centered   about 215 miles east-northeast of Barbuda in the northern Leeward  Islands. It was expected to continue moving toward the  west-northwest at near 12 mph.  The storm was expected to pass just north of the Leeward   Islands, but could threaten the northeastern Caribbean if it were  to shift at all to the south, said hurricane specialist Lixion  Avila.  The island governments of Antigua, Barbuda, Anguilla and Dutch   Saint Maarten, French St. Martin, and St. Barthelemy all had issued  tropical storm watches.  ``Right now the focus is on the Leeward Islands,'' Franklin   said. ``Any potential threat to the U.S. would be several days down  the road.''

At 5 p.m. EDT, Bonnie was centered near 17.8 north latitude, 60.7 west longitude, about 75 miles east of the northern Leeward Islands of the eastern Caribbean. The storm was headed west-northwest near 25 mph (40 kph) with top winds of 50 mph (80 kph).    Forecasters expected Bonnie to hold that course and slow somewhat.

In the Bahamian capital, Nassau, boats were hauled out of the   harbor, and the governor general's official residence was boarded  up. One resident, 25-year-old Brian Deal, said he had bought lumber  to cover his windows but was waiting to see how the storm would  progress.  Forecasters expected a weather system moving east across the   United States to force Dennis away from Florida. The National  Hurricane Center in Miami said Dennis might never hit land. But it  also could turn and strike near South Carolina as early as Sunday,  when it could be packing winds up to 109 mph, said forecaster  Robert Molleda.  ``We're not letting anyone off the hook anywhere along the   coast,'' said another meteorologist at the center, Todd Kimberlain.  Dennis became a hurricane late Wednesday as its winds reached 75   mph. At 5 p.m. EDT Thursday, its maximum winds were up to 80 mph  with hurricane force winds extending 45 miles from its center. The  strongest were in the northeast quadrant facing open seas.  Dennis was stalled about 40 miles east-northeast of San Salvador   and 210 miles east-southeast of Nassau.  Forecasters predicted the storm would strengthen as it continued   at about 7 mph on its west-northwest course.  As Dennis advanced, Bahamian authorities put the central Bahamas   and some northwest Bahamian islands on hurricane warning and the  rest of the northwest on hurricane watch. Some officials said they  feared residents were being complacent.

Packing winds of 120 mph at midday, Georges was expected to devastate Hispaniola, home to 15 million people, many of whom live in substandard housing.    The formidable storm knocked out power and forced residents into shelters across the densely populated Dominican Republic, where two people were killed by downed electrical lines.    Georges had paralyzed the Dominican Republic's capital of Santo Domingo by mid-afternoon, where it flooded streets, uprooted trees, and whisked away tin roofs and satellite dishes.    Meanwhile, officials expected a high death toll in Haiti due to the unsafe living conditions of thousands of desperately poor Haitians.    In Haiti's capital of Port-au-Prince, which is surrounded by slums, fragile communities of cardboard homes cling to slippery hillsides.    ``People die here even when we just get a heavy downpour, one that's not even a tropical storm, so this could be catastrophic for us,'' said Michelle Karshan, a spokeswoman for Haiti's President Rene Preval.    When Tropical Storm Gordon, a much weaker system than Georges, struck Haiti in 1994, hundreds of people were killed in mudslides.    Meanwhile, forecasters predicted Georges could affect southernmost Florida by late Thursday or early Friday. The National Hurricane Center in Miami was expected to place parts of South Florida under a hurricane watch late Tuesday.    Workers placed shutters over the windows at City Hall in Key West, while authorities advised all visitors and non-residents of the Florida Keys to evacuate the island chain who's only connection to the mainland is a two-lane highway.    ``We anticipate most of the evacuations will occur on Wednesday,'' said Billy Wagner, an official with the Monroe County Emergency Management Service. ``Anyone who's got plans to visit the Keys should postpone them.''    Hurricane warnings were posted for Haiti, eastern Cuba, the southwestern Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos islands, and a hurricane watch was in effect in parts of Cuba and the Bahamas on Tuesday.    Officials expected to issue a hurricane watch some time Wednesday for South Florida, where residents packed the stores in search of supplies such as batteries, flashlights and water.    Georges was expected to weaken somewhat as it moved off the shore of Hispaniola, but not below hurricane strength. As of 5 p.m. EDT Tuesday, Georges had sustained winds of 110 mph.    Still, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center predicted that Georges would pack much less of a punch than Hurricane Andrew, which caused billions of dollars in damage in densely populated South Florida in 1992.    On Monday and early Tuesday, Georges wreaked havoc across the northeast Caribbean, killing at least 10 people, mostly due to mudslides and collapsed roofs.    Boasting gusts of up to 130 mph, the hurricane dumped two feet of water in the mountains of Puerto Rico, while bending palm trees and flipping small aircraft like they were pancakes.    On Tuesday, all of the U.S. territory's 3.8 million people were without power, and 80 percent of people were without running water, while more than 25,000 people sought refuge in shelters.    The airport in San Juan, Puerto Rico was able to operate Tuesday for relief flights, but remained closed to other traffic.    ``We are starting from ground zero,'' Puerto Rico's Gov. Pedro Rossello said of recovery efforts.    President Clinton declared Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands disaster areas, authorizing immediate release of federal recovery aid. Scores of federal and Red Cross officials fanned across the island to assess damage, expected to soar to hundreds of millions of dollars.

DEBUG:simuser.search.interfaces.pyterrier:raw text: HURRICANE LOSING POWER AFTER GLANCING N.C. COASTLINE  The heart of Hurricane Floyd raked across the mainland here at Cape Fear Thursday morning, uprooting beach houses and leaving widespread floods as it set a rapid but steadily weakening course up the Atlantic coast.    The vast storm, whose advent alarmed much of the Eastern seaboard and widely disrupted air, rail and highway travel, was clearly losing its power with the dawn Thursday as the hurricane's eye danced across the coastline following a two-week buildup of the forces of nature and the precautions of government.    By Thursday evening, as Floyd reached northeastward along the New Jersey coast to New York City, its strength had further waned. It was downgraded to a tropical storm that still delivered lashing rain but that officials said presented no major threat to New York or other population centers.    At least 10 deaths were attributed to Floyd. Seven people died in traffic in the Carolinas and Virginia and two girls in Delaware drowned after a storm-swollen creek swept them into a sewage pipe. One man was presumed drowned in the Bahamas.    In the howling predawn of this coastal city, Floyd's power was measured to be dropping from a Category 4 to a Category 2 hurricane before dropping further to a tropical storm. While storm-drenched hurricane veterans were delighted after all the ominous evacuation warnings that it delivered far less physical injury and property destruction than originally feared, Floyd nevertheless proved relentlessly drenching, dropping as much as 19 inches of rain in some areas.    ``We were blessed this time,'' Fire Chief Keith Studt said as he roamed flooded streets and hacked away at fallen trees cluttering the streets of nearby Winter Park. ``We were lucky this thing suddenly ratcheted down before it hit town.''    Even so, the flooding and house damage out on Oak Island and other coastal barrier islands was considerable as the storm headed unpredictably northward, causing further disruption across a wide swath of the seaboard. Residents emerged uncertainly here from emergency centers to blink at piles of suddenly sun-dappled debris. By then Floyd was speeding up along the coast by Virginia, Chesapeake Bay and the New Jersey shore.    It lost further power but still spewed fresh damage along its western flank as the storm was described as fading into a rough course aimed toward eastern Long Island. But travel turmoil was widespread during the day and quickly became bumper to bumper around Washington, as a truck overturned on the storm-lashed Chesapeake Bay Bridge and blocked one of the major regional arteries.    On St. Michael's, a resort and retirement village on an elbowlike peninsula reaching into Chesapeake Bay, the day's rain and winds started turning savage in midafternoon as the eye of the storm approached.    Lawrence Murphy is a netter, who fishes with nets attached to poles. He left two, $10,000 polenets standing in the bay, where he assumed they would be safe from a northeaster.    ``But it's coming from the northwest,'' Murphy said. He said his nets had withstood 40-mph winds. ``But this was 60 or 70,'' he said, figuring his rigs were lost. ``The netters are caught real bad.''    The storm's eye loomed out of the Atlantic's 30-foot seas as a somewhat tentative invader, avoiding a deep inland attack and cutting across Cape Fear at 3:20 a.m. to begin a rapid ride up the coastline. Open relief at the turning was the reaction from this storm-hardened city, which has had to batten down for five hurricanes in the last three years.    ``It was merciful that it didn't come through at the 155 mph they were first talking about,'' said James Blanton, hitching his pickup truck's chain to a tree fallen across the road to his granddaughter's house. ``That's what saved us, even with all this flooding.''    For a while, the storm registered sustained winds of 98 mph that gusted up to 130, tearing up the roof of the Brunswick County Hospital to the south. There was some roof damage

The rapidly developing storm made landfall about 6 p.m. in   sparsely populated Kenedy County, about 70 miles south of Corpus  Christi.  Authorities reported no injuries in the hours after the storm   hit land. No major damage was apparent as the storm moved inland  Sunday night, but there was no word about largely unpopulated areas  directly in the hurricane's path. The population of Kenedy County  is 458.  Late Sunday, winds dropped to 105 mph and extended 30 miles out   from the storm. Bret continued moving west at 7 mph, and  forecasters expected it to decrease in strength overnight.  ``We're definitely not disappointed. We're very thankful,'' said   meteorologist Mark Lenz. ``The eye crossed the coastline in one  county along the Texas coast that was the least populated.''  An estimated 4 inches of rain fell on Corpus Christi and the   downtown area was littered with tree limbs and palm leaves. Strong  winds shred canvas awnings, rattled windows and whipped through  parking garages.  Forecasters had warned about tornadoes spawned by the storm, a   foot or more of rain and a storm surge that could approach 25 feet.  Earlier in the day, Jim Hoke of the National Weather Service   said the storm had ``clear potential of producing major disaster''  and compared the storm with Hurricane Andrew, which battered  Florida in 1992.  But unlike Andrew, which hit densely populated South Florida,   Bret hit between Corpus Christi (population of 300,000) and  Brownsville (132,000).  ``The good news is that the core of the hurricane ... is not   over the more populated areas,'' said Max Mayfield of the National  Hurricane Center.  The path resembles that of 1980's Hurricane Allen, which packed   winds of 185 mph and did $55 million in property damage but killed  only two people when it came ashore.  Palm trees whipped as the wind strengthened in early afternoon   and Corpus Christi Bay was covered with whitecaps as the Category 4  storm came ashore.  As the storm hit, some people braved driving rain and rolling   surf to walk on Corpus Christi beaches. A few even grabbed  surfboards or swam.  Carolina DeLeon, 23, was on the beach with her husband, Jesus,   making a videotape of the storm for their unborn daughter, Zara,  who is due in two weeks.  ``She'll probably say, 'Mom, you're crazy,'' Carolina DeLeon   said.  Corpus Christi declared a state of disaster and called for a   general but voluntary evacuation of the city, said city spokesman  Ted Nelson.  ``We are really trying to drive home the point that we take this   very seriously,'' Nelson said.  The evacuation was ``proceeding in an orderly fashion,'' Corpus   Christi City Manager David Garcia said Sunday.  Emergency officials in San Antonio set up shelters at Lackland   Air Force Base in anticipation of thousands of fleeing residents.  Families pouring into shelters were told to bring only what they  needed because of cramped quarters.  Many San Antonio hotels offered lowered evacuee rates with proof   of residence.  Like monstrous Hurricane Allen, Bret hit one of the state's   least populated areas, the ranch land of Kleberg and Kenedy  counties between Brownsville and Corpus Christi. However, tropical  storm-force winds of up to 73 mph extended more than 100 miles  outward from the center, the National Hurricane Center said.  The King Ranch occupies much of Kenedy and Kleberg counties.   Ranch president Jack Hunt said about 50 people had been evacuated  but there was no way to protect about 55,000 head of cattle.  ``The cattle will just have to ride it out,'' Hunt said. ``It's   not practical to move them out.''

Packing winds of 120 mph when it slammed into the Dominican capital of Santo Domingo, Georges was expected to leave Hispaniola devastated. The two-nation island is home to 15 million people, many of whom live in substandard housing.    At least 13 deaths have been attributed to Georges during its surge through the northern Caribbean. On Tuesday, the formidable storm knocked out power and forced residents into shelters across the densely populated Dominican Republic, where two people were killed by downed electrical lines and a third by a collapsing wall.    The storm already had claimed at least 10 lives in the Caribbean, including five in Puerto Rico, where it left widespread damage Monday.    Officials expected to issue a hurricane watch some time todayfor South Florida, where residents packed the stores in search of supplies such as batteries, flashlights and water.

Heavy winds and rain pelted the Bahamian capital of Nassau. It   was moving on a path that could deliver Florida its hardest storm  strike in years by Wednesday.  The storm reportedly lashed San Salvador and Cat Island in the   eastern section of the 600-mile chain of more than 700 islands.  In Nassau, strong winds rocked moving cars and kicked up sand   and surf that delighted some die-hards still frolicking in the  waves.  ``I have never been this scared about a storm,'' said shopkeeper   Angel Chea as she hastily boarded up her windows.  Floyd was on the verge of becoming a Category 5 storm, which   features top sustained winds of 156 mph with higher gusts.  ``It's capable of almost catastrophic destruction,'' said Todd   Kimberlain, a forecaster at the U.S. National Hurricane Center.  By comparison, Hurricane Andrew was a Category 4 storm when it   struck South Florida in 1992, killing 26 people and causing an  estimated $25 billion in damage.  Floyd's eye was likely to pass over Eleuthera Island at 4 a.m.,   meteorologists said -- but residents there were feeling the effect  by early evening.  ``There's fruit flying all over the place, and it's already   uprooted small trees in my garden,'' said Geoff Pearce of  Eleuthera, before phone lines there went silent.  Many Nassau residents were already in hurricane shelters.   ``I don't want to be caught in the rush,'' said Margaret Bastian   of Nassau, as she settled into a shelter with a blanket, a pillow  and a small bag full of food.  The storm interrupted airline flights, cruises and shipping   traffic between the United States and the Caribbean. American  Airlines on Monday canceled its nine daily flights between southern  Florida and its hub in San Juan, Puerto Rico, while both Carnival  Cruise Lines and Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines sent Bahamas-bound  ships to Mexico instead.  Bahamian officials warned that storm surges of up to 20 feet   could sweep as far as six miles inland. That's a terrifying  prospect on this island of New Providence, which is only seven  miles from north to south.  ``God is the only one who can help us now,'' said Nassau   resident Mildred Minnis.  All of the northwest and central Bahamian islands were under   hurricane warnings Monday night, as was all of the mainland Florida  east coast from Florida City to just south of Brunswick, Georgia.  Tropical storm warnings were posted for the southeastern Bahamas,  the nearby British Turks and Caicos islands and parts of the  Florida Keys. A hurricane watch was in effect for the Georgia coast  from Brunswick to Savannah and is expected to be extended to South  Carolina in the night.  In Nassau, the Bahamian capital, long lines formed at gasoline   stations and grocery stores and two major supermarkets ran out of  bottled water.  Bahamian schools were converted into hurricane shelters, and   officials planned to close Nassau's airport later Monday.  Organizers canceled a parade to welcome home Bahamian track runners  from the Outdoor World Championship in Seville, Spain.  ``We can't ask those girls to come from a safe place to an   unsafe place,'' said Sports Minster Zhivargo Laing.  In San Salvador, a quiet resort island where Christopher   Columbus is believed to have first landed in the New World, Riding  Rock Inn manager Carter Williams said he moved all of his guests to  a shelter at the nearby Church of God. ``I worked until about 2  o'clock (a.m.) preparing for the hurricane,'' Williams said.

Heavy winds and rain pelted the Bahamian capital of Nassau. It   was moving on a path that could deliver Florida its hardest storm  strike in years by Wednesday.  The storm reportedly lashed San Salvador and Cat Island in the   eastern section of the 600-mile chain of more than 700 islands.  In Nassau, strong winds rocked moving cars and kicked up sand   and surf that delighted some die-hards still frolicking in the  waves.  ``I have never been this scared about a storm,'' said shopkeeper   Angel Chea as she hastily boarded up her windows.  Floyd was on the verge of becoming a Category 5 storm, which   features top sustained winds of 156 mph with higher gusts.  ``It's capable of almost catastrophic destruction,'' said Todd   Kimberlain, a forecaster at the U.S. National Hurricane Center.  By comparison, Hurricane Andrew was a Category 4 storm when it   struck South Florida in 1992, killing 26 people and causing an  estimated $25 billion in damage.  Floyd's eye was likely to pass over Eleuthera Island at 4 a.m.,   meteorologists said -- but residents there were feeling the effect  by early evening.  ``There's fruit flying all over the place, and it's already   uprooted small trees in my garden,'' said Geoff Pearce of  Eleuthera, before phone lines there went silent.  Many Nassau residents were already in hurricane shelters.   ``I don't want to be caught in the rush,'' said Margaret Bastian   of Nassau, as she settled into a shelter with a blanket, a pillow  and a small bag full of food.  The storm interrupted airline flights, cruises and shipping   traffic between the United States and the Caribbean. American  Airlines on Monday canceled its nine daily flights between southern  Florida and its hub in San Juan, Puerto Rico, while both Carnival  Cruise Lines and Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines sent Bahamas-bound  ships to Mexico instead.  Bahamian officials warned that storm surges of up to 20 feet   could sweep as far as six miles inland. That's a terrifying  prospect on this island of New Providence, which is only seven  miles from north to south.  ``God is the only one who can help us now,'' said Nassau   resident Mildred Minnis.  All of the northwest and central Bahamian islands were under   hurricane warnings Monday night, as was all of the mainland Florida  east coast from Florida City to just south of Brunswick, Georgia.  Tropical storm warnings were posted for the southeastern Bahamas,  the nearby British Turks and Caicos islands and parts of the  Florida Keys. A hurricane watch was in effect for the Georgia coast  from Brunswick to Savannah and is expected to be extended to South  Carolina in the night.  In Nassau, the Bahamian capital, long lines formed at gasoline   stations and grocery stores and two major supermarkets ran out of  bottled water.  Bahamian schools were converted into hurricane shelters, and   officials planned to close Nassau's airport later Monday.  Organizers canceled a parade to welcome home Bahamian track runners  from the Outdoor World Championship in Seville, Spain.  ``We can't ask those girls to come from a safe place to an   unsafe place,'' said Sports Minster Zhivargo Laing.  In San Salvador, a quiet resort island where Christopher   Columbus is believed to have first landed in the New World, Riding  Rock Inn manager Carter Williams said he moved all of his guests to  a shelter at the nearby Church of God. ``I worked until about 2  o'clock (a.m.) preparing for the hurricane,'' Williams said.  The island's Club Med resort said some customers would wait out   the storm at the resort.  At 2 a.m. EDT, Floyd's center was 53 miles east of Eleuthera   Island in the northwest Bahamas, which is 320 miles southeast of  Miami. The National Weather Servic

Some people were stranded for  a second time on the Outer Banks islands as ferries shut down.  Forecasters said Dennis was likely to be a minimal hurricane by   the time it hit land just northeast of Morehead City late Saturday,  and hurricane warnings were in effect along much of the North  Carolina shoreline. Tropical storm warnings extended northward  along the Virginia coast to Chincoteague.  Residents of the fishing villages on the marshy peninsula where   the storm was expected to strike were more frustrated than worried  as the storm approached.  ``We put our boats in the harbor down here last Saturday and we   ain't got out yet,'' said Jonathan Robinson, a commercial fisherman  from Stacy. ``We're anticipating more bad weather, but hopefully it  won't be as bad as the initial hit. We'll be glad to see Dennis  going.''  In spite of 30-foot swells, a few fishermen did go to sea   earlier in the week after Dennis made its first pass along the  coast, but most waited for the weather to improve.  ``It's not been fittin' to play golf,'' Robinson said. ``I think   most of 'em are just hangin' in there listening to the weather  reports and drinking some coffee, or a few beers.''  Farther north, in southeastern Virginia, an apparent tornado   touched down in the city of Hampton, damaging several apartment  buildings and an assisted living center, and 20 to 30 people  suffered minor injuries, police spokesman Jeff Walden said.  Another twister hit a barn and snapped utility poles in nearby   Chesapeake, Va., police said.  At 3 p.m. EDT Saturday, the storm was centered about 25 miles   east-southeast of Cape Lookout and about 55 miles south-southwest  of Cape Hatteras, the National Weather Service said. It was moving  toward the northwest at about 10 mph.  The storm's top sustained wind had strengthened slightly to 70   mph, and was expected to reach minimal hurricane strength of 74 mph  by the time its center reached shore, said Michael Moneypenny of  the weather service office in Raleigh. He said Dennis would weaken  rapidly over land while dropping heavy rainfall.  ``There wouldn't be a whole lot of damage. Most of it would be   flooding from the sound side,'' he said.  Cedar Island, a small community about four miles from Stacy, or   25 miles northeast of Morehead City, was about three-quarters under  water by early afternoon as the wind pushed water into the area,  Moneypenny said.  Rain spread inland from Maryland to southern North Carolina as   the storm approached.  Tourists on Hatteras Island who ignored evacuation orders last   weekend found themselves stranded for a second time Saturday when  the rising wind from the approaching storm disrupted ferry service  to the mainland.  ``We're stuck,'' said Martha Bourne of Beaufort, who got to the   Hatteras ferry landing in time to learn that service had been shut  down as Dennis moved closer to shore.  A few tourists had left the island Thursday and Friday when the   first ferries delivered emergency supplies and heavy equipment to  Hatteras and Ocracoke Island.  Engineers worked Saturday to rebuild N.C. 12, the only highway   along the low-lying, fragile Outer Banks. The highway had been open  to residents with four-wheel-drive vehicles, but was closed again  Saturday afternoon as the wind increased and torrential rain  flooded the island.  The storm's first pass tore out a half-mile section of the road   north of Buxton, and reconstruction work was expected to take  several days.

Another hurricane gained strength in the Pacific Ocean but was expected to peter out over open seas.    ``It's definitely going to happen. The southeastern portion (of the Bahamas) is going to be hit today,'' meteorologist Dave Chorney said from the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami.    Bonnie nearly stalled Saturday about 115 miles (185 kilometers) north-northeast of the British Turk island, drenching it and the nearby Bahamian island of Mayaguana with heavy rains carried by gusty winds, residents said.    On Crooked Island, fuel distributor Daisy Scavella said the sun was shining Saturday morning as residents battened down windows.    ``I guess we're going to have a good blow,'' she said. People on the low-lying islands were most concerned about flooding. Bahamian forecaster Basil Dean said the islands already were experiencing higher-than-usual tides that Bonnie's storm surges could rise another 3 to 7 feet (a meter to two meters).    Bahamian radio warned the islands' fishing fleet and yachters to make for safe port. The Bahamas Air-Sea Rescue Association said some U.S. yachters had turned back to Florida.    The islands' meteorological department said Bonnie would hit landfall in the southeast later Saturday and pass by Long Island, Eleuthera and the Abacos on Sunday and Monday.    ``People along the southeastern U.S. should pay attention to its progress,'' said Jerry Jarrell, director of National Hurricane Center.    He said Bonnie was packing sustained winds of 85 mph (140 kph) that could reach 100 mph (160 kph) by Monday and eventually upgrade to a Category 3 storm with winds more than 111 mph (178 kph) capable of causing extensive damage. Chorney noted that the worst thunderstorms were on the northern side of the system, in the open Atlantic.    Bonnie was expected to resume its north-northwest tack and move at 10-15 mph (16-24 kph) on Sunday, the hurricane center said.    The Bahamian government Saturday posted a hurricane watch for the northwest islands and hurricane warnings covered the British Turks and Caicos islands and the southeastern and central Bahamas.    ``Preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion,'' the hurricane center urged.    North Florida is the most likely target to be hit if the storm reaches the mainland. Still, the storm could veer out to sea and miss the U.S. coast entirely, Jarrell said.    Meanwhile, another weather system that threatened parts of Texas lost power Saturday.    All warnings were discontinued when Tropical Storm Charley weakened to a depression, though the hurricane center warned small vessels to remain in port along the northwestern Gulf of Mexico until winds and waves that reached 10 feet (3 meters) subside.    The threat of heavy rains and a storm forced the evacuation of thousands of people from oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico.    As it moved into Texas, Matagorda Island was hit the hardest with 9 inches (23 centimeters) of rain and 70 mph (110 kph) wind gusts early Saturday.    Also Friday, a storm in the Pacific Ocean reached hurricane strength but remained far off the Mexican coast.    Hurricane Howard intensified Saturday, with winds of 110 mph (176 kph). The hurricane center said it was expected to become stronger before dissipating in the Pacific later Sunday.    Authorities closed the Acapulco port and warned ships to be cautious of high waves along the southwestern Mexican coast.    The Atlantic Basin typically has nine tropical storms each year with six of them becoming hurricanes, two of them intense. In 1997, there were seven named storms, three hurricanes and one intense hurricane.

Shelters and hotels from Miami to Orlando filled up after more than 1 million people from Key West to Tampa were urged or ordered to leave coastal and low-lying areas and mobile homes before the storm came. The storm, having killed more than 300 people in the Caribbean, was expected to attack the northern Gulf coast after it leaves southern Florida. A hail of leaves, branches and palm fronds blew across the Overseas Highway in Marathon, in the middle Keys, and strong wind lifted rainwater off roofs. Some 150,000 people lost power as the edges of the storm lashed the Miami and Fort Lauderdale areas. At 11 a.m. EDT, Georges' eye was about 25 kilometers south of Key West. The eye was expected to pass west of Key West by late morning and the storm was expected to move into the Gulf of Mexico. A hurricane warning was posted for the Keys and the Gulf Coast north to Longboat Key. The coast from Longboat Key to Bayport was under a tropical storm warning. About 2,500 members of the National Guard were ordered to be ready for hurricane assignments. Four C-130 cargo aircraft were reserved to fly troops to the Keys for post-storm security. The storm landed the Keys area shortly before sunset Thursday. Wind and rain became more steady and rendered 4,000 people without power. Georges is the first major hurricane to hit southern Florida since Andrew, which caused 25 billion U.S. dollars damage in the state in 1992 and killed 26 people.

All 1,500 homes on the St. George Island and 20,000 customers across the Panhandle lost power. The storm was downgraded to a tropical storm late Thursday morning, but flooding was threatened to the Southeast of the nation. A flood watch covered a wide area from Tallahassee east to Jacksonville and south to Tampa Bay, as well as parts of Georgia and Alabama.

In Florida, up to 100,000 people were ordered to begin evacuating the exposed Florida Keys, and cars, trucks and sport utility vehicles streamed along the highway linking the island chain to the Florida mainland.    South Florida was put under a hurricane watch and Gov. Lawton Chiles declared a state of emergency in central and southern Florida, allowing the state to use the National Guard, lift tolls along evacuation routes and purchase emergency supplies.    The Cayman Islands issued tropical storm warnings for Little Cayman and Cayman Brac.    The hurricane first hit the small islands of the northeast Caribbean early Monday, killing three in St. Kitts _ where the government estimated damage at dlrs 445 million _ and two in Antigua.    The U.S. Virgin Islands, which were badly battered in recent hurricanes, suffered some damage to homes, tourist facilities and utilities; on the island of St. Croix, a looter shot and killed a man while burglarizing his home.    The effects of the storm were expected to be felt as far south as Jamaica, where officials expected heavy rains.    Three people were killed directly by the storm in Puerto Rico, where the government's insurance commissioner, Juan Garcia, estimated damages at dlrs 1 billion. Another eight, most of them elderly, died of heart attacks or asthma complications during the storm.    On Wednesday reconstruction efforts were under way in communities like Loiza, where many homes of wood and zinc roofs were crushed and washed away.    ``My sister's house is all gone. And that used to be my uncle's house,'' said Luis Manso, pointing to a nearby pile of wood debris as he struggled to repair his own shattered fruit and vegetable stand ``quickly, before the thieves come.''    The Federal Emergency Management Agency reported that about a third of Puerto Rico's power was expected back Wednesday, but 715,000 remained without running water. FEMA said airport damage was minimal and the port of San Juan reported no major damage. Coffee and plantain crops, however, were badly harmed, FEMA said.    Seventeen were officially reported killed in the Dominican Republic, which Georges hit Tuesday. However, the actual toll appears to have been much higher.    Reporters said that in San Cristobal, which is 20 miles (30 kilometers) east of Santo Domingo, the Nizao river overflowed and knocked down a part of a school used as a shelter, killing five, and 31 were missing. Unconfirmed media reports put the death toll much higher, and officials planned a news conference on the situation later Wednesday.    In the shanty neighborhood of La Cienega, the swollen river invaded thousands of homes, covering some up to the roofs in fetid water. Residents swam to their houses to try to retrieve their belongings, some using empty water jugs tied to their arms to help them float.    Earlier, looters in Santo Domingo waded waist-deep in water, balancing televisions and air conditioners on their heads as 110 mph (180 kph) winds toppled trees and crushed houses. Bands of youths with machetes and pistols roamed the streets, many of them drunk. Two of the dead were looters shot by police enforcing a curfew.    From the Dominican Republic Georges proceeded Tuesday night to Haiti, occupying the western third of the island of Hispaniola.    In the poorest country in the Western hemisphere, Georges unleashed flash floods and killed at least 17.    Yolaine Surena of the civil defense authority said the government could spare only dlrs 130,000 in emergency aid.

Barbados was under a hurricane watch today. Forecasters said a   similar watch could be issued for portions of the Windward Islands,  an island chain in the southeastern Caribbean, later in the day.  In Trinidad and Tobago, residents were preparing for possible   flooding.  At 8 a.m. EDT, the center of Tropical Storm Jose was about 430   miles east-southeast of Barbados.  Jose was moving west near 10 mph and a gradual turn toward the   west-northwest was expected. Maximum sustained winds were near 40  mph, with higher gusts. The storm's tropical force winds extended  outward up to 50 miles.  Jose is the 10th tropical storm of the 1999 Atlantic hurricane   season, which runs from June 1 through Nov. 30.

DEBUG:simuser.search.interfaces.pyterrier:raw text: HURRICANE LOSING POWER AFTER GLANCING N.C. COASTLINE  The heart of Hurricane Floyd raked across the mainland here at Cape Fear Thursday morning, uprooting beach houses and leaving widespread floods as it set a rapid but steadily weakening course up the Atlantic coast.    The vast storm, whose advent alarmed much of the Eastern seaboard and widely disrupted air, rail and highway travel, was clearly losing its power with the dawn Thursday as the hurricane's eye danced across the coastline following a two-week buildup of the forces of nature and the precautions of government.    By Thursday evening, as Floyd reached northeastward along the New Jersey coast to New York City, its strength had further waned. It was downgraded to a tropical storm that still delivered lashing rain but that officials said presented no major threat to New York or other population centers.    At least 12 deaths were attributed to Floyd, eight of them from traffic accidents in the Carolinas and Virginia. Two girls in Delaware drowned after a storm-swollen creek swept them into a sewage pipe; a woman was killed in Virginia when a tree fell on her mobile home, and one man was presumed drowned in the Bahamas.    The storm swept away parts of a bridge in North East, Md., forcing 100 families downstream to abandon their homes. Four oil tanks holding 80,000 gallons collapsed, though officials were unsure if the oil contaminated nearby Chesapeake Bay.    In the howling predawn of this coastal city, Floyd's power was measured to be dropping from a Category 4 to a Category 2 hurricane before dropping further to a tropical storm. While storm-drenched hurricane veterans were delighted after all the ominous evacuation warnings that it delivered far less physical injury and property destruction than originally feared, Floyd nevertheless proved relentlessly drenching, dropping as much as 19 inches of rain in some areas, and cutting power to 1.4 million in the Carolinas.    ``We were blessed this time,'' Fire Chief Keith Studt said as he roamed flooded streets and hacked away at fallen trees cluttering the streets of nearby Winter Park. ``We were lucky this thing suddenly ratcheted down before it hit town.''    Even so, the flooding and house damage out on Oak Island and other coastal barrier islands was considerable as the storm headed unpredictably northward, causing further disruption across a wide swath of the seaboard. Residents emerged uncertainly here from emergency centers to blink at piles of suddenly sun-dappled debris. By then Floyd was speeding up along the coast by Virginia, Chesapeake Bay and the New Jersey shore.    It lost further power but still spewed fresh damage along its western flank as the storm was described as fading into a rough course aimed toward eastern Long Island. But travel turmoil was widespread during the day and quickly became bumper to bumper around Washington, as a truck overturned on the storm-lashed Chesapeake Bay Bridge and blocked one of the major regional arteries.    On St. Michael's, a resort and retirement village on an elbowlike peninsula reaching into Chesapeake Bay, the day's rain and winds started turning savage in midafternoon as the eye of the storm approached.    Lawrence Murphy is a netter, who fishes with nets attached to poles. He left two, $10,000 polenets standing in the bay, where he assumed they would be safe from a northeaster.    ``But it's coming from the northwest,'' Murphy said. He said his nets had withstood 40-mph winds. ``But this was 60 or 70,'' he said, figuring his rigs were lost. ``The netters are caught real bad.''    The storm's eye loomed out of the Atlantic's 30-foot seas as a somewhat tentative invader, avoiding a deep inland attack and cutting across Cape Fear at 3:20 a.m. to begin a rapid ride up the coastline. Open relief at the turning was the reaction from this storm-hardened city, which has had to batten down for five hurricanes in the last three years.    ``It was merciful that it didn't come through at the 155 mph they were firs

Florida Governor Jeb Bush declared a state of emergency for 56 of 67 counties as the storm approached and schools closed in some areas such as Tampa, Orlando and the Florida Keys, but no significant damage was reported. The storm, formed in the Gulf of Mexico, was expected to hit near Tampa in central Florida. But a cold front pushed it southward and it sliced across the southern tip of the Florida peninsula toward the Atlantic Tuesday. The storm, which could produce storm surge flooding of up to 6 feet above normal in some places, was expected to cross Florida and stay offshore as it heads north along the East Coast. Five to 10 inches of rain were expected from the storm forecast to come ashore near Naples, 150 miles south of Clearwater, by Tuesday night. Essentially, the southern peninsula of Florida is going to get lots of rain and gust, said Stephen Baig, oceangrapher at the National Hurricane Center in Miami.

By the time Floyd's center wheeled past the casinos of Atlantic City, N.J., Thursday afternoon, it had whipped and wrung itself down to a tropical storm _ but not before dropping up to 19 inches of rain in the Carolinas, causing hundreds of airline flights to be canceled, interrupting train and ferry service all along the East Coast and throwing New York and New Jersey into states of emergency.    A tropical storm warning for heavy rains and winds of more than 40 mph was in effect in northern New Jersey and New York City and up to the Merrimack River in Massachusetts.    Floyd had been feared most for the intensity of its winds, which had reached 155 mph over the South Atlantic and made it a borderline Category 5 hurricane, the most destructive of all. But after raking the Bahamas with winds of more than 100 mph, Floyd collided with a cold front pushing a trough of low pressure and the combination turned it into a super-wet storm when it hit the Northeast.    ``It interacted with the cold front, and together they made more (rain) than either one by itself,'' said Jim Lushine, storm warning coordinator for the National Weather Service.    The hurricane brought the largest peacetime evacuation in U.S. history from Florida's east coast northward. It plowed into the North Carolina coast just before dawn Thursday, triggering widespread flooding and blacking out power to hundreds of thousands of people.    North Carolina Gov. James Hunt said thousands of residents had lost their homes and damage would be in the hundreds of millions of dollars.    At least seven deaths were blamed on Floyd, including four in North Carolina from traffic accidents provoked by the storm. In Maryland, one man died Wednesday of a heart attack while overseeing a Red Cross shelter set up in his school building.    Another man was swept away Tuesday by a raging storm tide in the Bahamas, which bore the brunt of the hurricane's force before it turned north into cooler waters and began to weaken. Floyd's storm surge and wind gusts up to 190 mph swept an entire village out to sea, flattened hundreds of homes and destroyed power and phone lines throughout the islands.    In Florida, 65,000 Florida Power &AMP; Light customers were still without electricity Thursday night, mostly in Volusia and Brevard counties. FPL expects to have all power restored by tonight, spokeswoman Betty Nunez said.    As the storm swept farther up the U.S. coast, winds and rain caused 1.4 million utility customers from South Carolina to New Jersey to lose power. Flooding and power failures combined to shut down Portsmouth, Va.'s water supply system, which serves 110,000 customers.    Schools were closed for more than 2 million youngsters in Washington, Baltimore, all of New Jersey, Philadelphia and New York City.    Palm Beach International Airport was open Thursday, but many travelers were stranded. All flights to the Northeast were canceled or delayed as Floyd affected airports from South Carolina to New England. Flights to and from Boston, Hartford, New York and Newark were canceled. Flights to Philadelphia, Raleigh/Durham, Baltimore and Washington were expected to resume Thursday night.    Floyd roared ashore at 3 a.m. near Cape Fear, N.C., with 110 mph winds, then quickly weakened after flooding the coasts of the Carolinas and Virginia with more than a foot of rain and chasing tens of thousands of people into shelters. It was downgraded to a tropical storm as sustained winds fell to 65 mph, below the 74 mph threshold for a hurricane.    Until Hurricane Floyd, thousands of people who live on the twisting roads near the border of North and South Carolina thought they were on high ground. But Floyd wasn't like other hurricanes _ it didn't smash windows, rip off roofs or snap acres of trees.    Instead, it quietly filled nearby

DEBUG:simuser.search.interfaces.pyterrier:raw text: &HT;       ATLANTA - Hurricane Debby began stair-stepping up the Caribbean Islands Tuesday, sparing the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico the brunt of its 75 mph winds.    And that left the fast-moving storm 1,000 miles of open sea on a straight shot that would bring it near South Florida by Friday morning, eight years and a day after Hurricane Andrew barrelled into Miami-Dade County.    Tropical storm or hurricane watches could be posted in South Florida by late afternoon today, National Hurricane Center forecasters said. A watch means tropical storm or hurricane-force winds are possible within 36 hours.    ``If we do feel the effects of Debby, it would probably be Friday morning,'' said hurricane center meteorologist Krissy Williams.    Debby is likely to be a Category 2 storm, with winds of 105 mph by late afternoon Thursday as its projected path reaches Andros Island in the Bahamas, about 200 miles southeast of West Palm Beach, Williams said. Hurricane force winds of 74 mph or more are likely to extend 80 miles north of the center of the storm.    The official forecast track puts the hurricane anywhere from Melbourne along the central Florida coast to south of Cuba by 5 p.m. Friday. But not all of the computer models agree on a track.    One has Debby continuing on a more westerly path into the Florida straits. Another has it turning north over the Bahamas.    The storm is being guided by a high pressure ridge over Florida and the eastern Atlantic Ocean, steering Debby on its west-northwest path under the ridge. But a weakness in the ridge over the Bahamas could allow the storm to veer more northward by Thursday.    ``It's just too early to tell,'' Williams said.    Local and state emergency management officials moved to a state of watchful waiting Tuesday, advising South Florida residents to begin thinking of what last-minute preparations they should make.    ``If it stays on our track, we've got Wednesday and Thursday to prepare.'' said National Hurricane Center Director Max Mayfield.    ``We're watching real closely,'' said Palm Beach County Emergency Management Director Bill O'Brien, who met with and made calls to the Palm Beach County School Board, American Red Cross and state officials Tuesday.    Partial activation of the emergency operations center could come today, he said.    The South Florida Water Management District opened low pre-storm water releases from canals in Miami-Dade County Tuesday. Water levels in primary canals in counties farther north, including Palm Beach, Martin and St. Lucie were within seasonal ranges so gates were not opened yet.    Lake Okeechobee is below normal level so no releases are planned.    Florida Power &AMP; Light will not position crews until after the storm hits. ``We've found it's better to wait until we really know where it's going,'' said FPL spokesman Bill Swank. ``All the heavy hurricane season preparation has been done and we did a dry run earlier.''    By midafternoon Tuesday, local residents were keeping an eye on Debby and beginning to make preparations for a possible landfall in South Florida.    At the Publix supermarket on Southern Boulevard in West Palm Beach, workers were stocking extra cases of bottled water that had been shipped to the store earlier in the day.    ``If you're in the water business right now, that's a good business to be in,'' one employee said. ``I'd hate to see what it looks like'' today.    Tyler Franz of West Palm Beach was one of the few people stocking up, buying 12 bottles of water.    ``I left work early so I could beat the 5 o'clock rush,'' Franz said. ``People are going to get home, watch the evening news and come out here. It'll be packed.''    Meanwhile, at the Home Depot on Lake Worth Road, Efrin Valle was buying plywood to cover his carport. He said he and his family are watching the storm, but aren't nervous, yet.    That seems to be the reaction of most people Tuesday, said Jerry Hester, Home Depot's sales manager.    ``We've been selling panels and plywood, but there's no pan

 deadly hurricane season predicted 


	orlando, fla. (ap) -- tropical storms and hurricanes killed  
thousands last year, and a top forecaster says the 1999 atlantic 
hurricane season could be just as deadly. 


	``the odds strongly favor us entering a new era for storms,''  
william gray, a colorado state university weather forecaster, said 
thursday at the national hurricane conference. 


	gray predicted the atlantic hurricane season this year could  
match the 14 tropical storms and 10 hurricanes that killed at least 
10,000 people last year, mostly by hurricane mitch in honduras. 


	cyclical changes making atlantic waters warmer and saltier are  
behind the upswing in storm activity, gray said. the same 
conditions have not been seen since the late 1960s. 


	the 1999 season will have 14 named storms and nine hurricanes,  
four of them major, gray predicted. ``that's a very active 
season,'' he said. 


	florida could experience severe damage sometime in the near  
future because of the upswing in the number of storms and because 
more people are living in storm-prone areas. 


	``we're going to be seeing a $50 billion-, $70 billion-, $100  
billion-damage storm,'' gray said. ``florida is a sitting duck.'' 


	over the last 30 years, an average of about 10 tropical storms  
have occurred annually, and five or six have reached hurricane 
strength. 


	the hurricane season begins june 1 and lasts through nov. 30.  


	gov. jeb bush said at the conference that he would work to  
improve hurricane evacuation routes and maintain tougher building 
codes. 


	``we have a responsibility to make sure people can escape when  
they are asked to do so,'' he said. 


	tropical storm and hurricane names selected for 1999 for the  
atlantic, gulf of mexico and carribean are arlene, bret, cindy, 
dennis, emily, floyd, gert, harvey, irene, jose, katrina, lenny, 
maria, nate, ophelia, philippe, rita, stan, tammy, vince and wilma."

 many hurricanes expected this year 


	orlando, fla. (ap) -- the upcoming atlantic hurricane season  
could be as fierce as last season in which thousands of people were 
killed, a leading storm forecaster said today. 


	the 1999 season will have 14 named storms and nine hurricanes,  
four of them major, predicted colorado state weather forecaster 
william gray. 


	``that's a very active season,'' said gray, who was taking part  
in the three-day national hurricane conference. 


	last season, there were 14 tropical storms, including 10  
hurricanes. the hurricane death toll in 1998 was at least 10,000, 
mostly from hurricane mitch's damage in honduras. 


	the hurricane season begins june 1 and lasts through nov. 30.  


	over the last 30 years, an average of about 10 tropical storms  
have occurred annually, and five or six have reached hurricane 
strength. 


	changes in the atlantic that make the ocean warmer and saltier  
are the reason for the increase, gray said. these cyclical 
conditions haven't been seen since the late 1960s. 


	``the odds strongly favor us entering a new era for storms,''  
gray said. 


	despite the devastation wreaked by hurricane andrew in 1992,  
florida has been lucky during the past 25 years in that the state 
has seen fewer than usual hurricanes, gray said. 


	he said florida could see more damage in the near future because  
of the upswing in the number of storms and because more people are 
living in storm-prone areas. 


	``we're going to be seeing a $50 billion-, $70 billion-, $100  
billion- damage storm,'' gray said. ``florida is a sitting duck.''"

"&ht;   



   orlando, fla. _ andrew was in living color.


   the great storms from earlier this century are found only in
fading snapshots, fading clippings, the fading memories of elderly
survivors from a more sparsely developed florida.


   but if those storms were to strike today, they would hammer a
florida of 15 million people, gleaming megalopolises and coastlines
packed shoulder-to-shoulder with luxury high-rises.


   adjusting for how florida has changed, those storms would do
damage on the order of hurricane andrew, an unnerving prospect for
the future, hurricane researcher christopher w. landsea told the
national hurricane conference on friday.


   researchers studied the economic impact of the century's most
ferocious storms as if they had hit the united states today.
adjusting for inflation, growth and increased property values, they
found that seven of the 11 costliest storms and 13 of the top 30
were storms that hit florida.


   topping the list: the great 1926 storm, which would cause an
estimated $80 billion in damage today. it was almost as strong as
andrew and as big as hugo. and unlike andrew, which made landfall
in homestead, the 1926 hurricane hit downtown miami head-on.


   andrew was second. it cost $26 billion when it hit in 1992. just
seven years later, its impact would be $36 billion, the study
concluded.


   the 1928 hurricane, which drowned up to 3,000 in the glades, was
ranked seventh, at $15 billion.


   meanwhile, colorado state university hurricane soothsayer
william gray on wednesday updated his annual forecast by saying
he'll stick to his december prediction of 14 named storms _
tropical storms or hurricanes _ with nine of those becoming
hurricanes, and four becoming major hurricanes, with winds of more
than 111 mph. gray never says where or whether storms will strike
land, although he has said the odds of a hurricane hitting the u.s.
east coast, including all of florida, is three times above normal
this year.


   increasing awareness and preparation, better building codes and
the advent of mass communications have dropped hurricane deaths
from thousands per year at the turn of the century to 100 a year
now, but property damages have risen sharply.


   despite that, people continue to migrate to america's coastline,
especially florida's, landsea told weather researchers and
emergency managers.


   applying his formula to history, landsea contended the united
states has a one-in-six chance of suffering a storm with more than
$10 billion in damages, and every year, ``the stakes rise due to
inexorable coastal population growth and development.''


   already about 110 million people _ nearly half of all americans
_ live in a 5-mile-wide coastal strip that accounts for only 10
percent of the nation's mass. it's expected to rise to
three-fourths of americans during the 21st century.


   more people live in miami-dade and broward counties, according
to the 1990 census, than lived in all 109 coastal counties from
texas to virginia in 1930, he said.


   major hurricanes make up only one-fifth of all tropical storms
but account for 85 percent of the damage. and while peninsular
florida experienced seven major hurricanes from 1944 to 1950 and
only three since, it is the increasingly-valuable property in their
path that will mean more costly storms in the future, landsea said.


   ``we are causing hurricane disasters,'' he said. ``it is only a
matter of time before the nation experiences a $50 billion or
greater storm, with multibillion-dollar losses becoming more
frequent.''


   landsea, a hurricane researcher at the south florida-based
hurricane research division of the national oceanic and atmospheric
administration, parent of the national weather service and the
national hurricane center, conducted his research with roger a.
pielke jr. of the national center for atmospheric research in
boulder, colo.

   washington _ this year's hurricane season, which officially
ended tuesday, was busier than usual, said james baker,
administrator for the national oceanic and atmospheric
administration, and similar activity is expected next year.


   since the hurricane season began june 1, there were 12 tropical
storms, eight of which became hurricanes, including and five major
hurricanes _ category 3 and higher. a category 3 storm has winds of
at least 111 miles per hour. this year's hurricanes claimed 76
lives, and cost about $4.3 billion in damages.


   last year, also an active hurricane season, there were 14
tropical storms, 10 of which became hurricanes, including three
major hurricanes costing $7.3 billion.


   hurricane floyd, which posed a serious threat to florida and the
carolinas in september with winds up to 155 mph, killed 57 people
and was the deadliest storm since hurricane agnes killed 122 people
in 1972. floyd ranked as the 20th deadliest u.s. hurricane in the
century.


   in october, hurricane irene battered cuba and the florida keys
with winds of 110 mph and caused the indirect deaths of eight
people. irene dumped torrential rains of up to 20 inches on dade
and broward counties, causing urban flooding and $800 million in
damage.


   ``hurricanes floyd and irene are cruel reminders that hurricanes
can produce tragic loss of life and devastating economic
disruption,'' baker said.


   the best predictor of hurricanes is the impact of el nino and la
nina. el nino is a disruption of ocean atmosphere systems in the
pacific ocean resulting in warmer waters in the pacific ocean,
while la nina produces colder waters in the pacific ocean. as the
colder waters of the pacific ocean shift, a change in the
atmospheric winds occurs that generates the formation of hurricanes
in the atlantic ocean.


   the annual average of hurricanes has increased over the past
five years, said jerry jarrell, director of the national hurricane
center. while officials have been largely successful in predicting
hurricane tracks, they still lack the tools to forecast rapid
changes in a hurricane's intensity.


   inland flooding remains the leading cause of hurricane deaths
and damages. jarrell said better education about hurricane flooding
and reviews of evacuation routes is needed to reduce future
hurricane devastation.

 hurricane bonnie lashes virginia coast 


washington, august 28 (xinhua) -- hurricane bonnie regained
strength and slashed the virginia coast friday, peeling off roofs,
flattening trees and knocking out power to 300,000 homes.


the storm, which had degraded to a tropical storm thursday
night, again became a hurricane friday, unleashing intense winds
and heavy rains directly onto the shore.


on virginia beach, shop and hotel windows were blown out. small
trees and limbs lay along the sides of the road. it also lifted
the roof off some houses and businesses.


by late friday afternoon, the storm again was downgraded to a
tropical storm when winds dropped below hurricane-force to 110
kilometers per hour. the storm was 424 kilometers south-southwest
of nantucket island in massachusetts and moving to the northeast
at 23 kph.


tropical storm warnings were in effect from watch hill, rhode
island, to plymouth, massachusetts.


bonnie landed east coast of the united states on wednesday
night with 185 kph winds, downing trees, tearing off roofs and
flooding roads in north carolina and south carolina. it caused one
billion to two billion u.s. dollars in damage, including that of
farms, in north carolina, and at least 27 million u.s. dollars in
south carolina.


the insurance information institute estimated friday the
industry will pay 375 million dollars in claims from bonnie,
mostly in north carolina.


a 12-year-old girl was killed in north carolina's currituck
county, near the virginia state line, when a tree fell on her
house thursday night, and a 50-year-old man in myrtle beach, south
carolina, was electrocuted wednesday while checking his generator
after his apartment lost power.


as the storm was moving north and off the mainland, north
carolina residents enjoyed a brilliant blue sky friday.


however, out in the atlantic, another hurricane, danielle, was
closing to the coast, 500 kilometers north of san juan, puerto
rico, and strengthening with 145 kph winds. it was moving
west-northwest at 255 kph toward the u.s. east coast."

   west palm beach, fla. _ the 1999 hurricane season, which ends
tuesday, will be remembered for floyd, the big one that got away,
and irene, the little one that didn't; for a late season hurricane
that reminded us to be wary into november; and for an ominous
first: five storms of category 4 or higher in one year _
miraculously, none coming ashore at that strength.


   the five storms that killed people _ none stronger than category
2 on the saffir-simpson scale when they made landfall _ may have
been responsible for the deaths of nearly 500 people.


   after bracing for hurricane floyd, which threatened to be the
most powerful hurricane strike on palm beach county and the
treasure coast since the great 1928 storm, people were caught off
guard when irene slipped up the peninsula and drenched south
florida on oct. 15 and 16.


   as it turned out, irene brought gusts as high as 92 mph to the
glades, but never brought hurricane-force winds across the
mainland. still, its rains _ boynton beach alone experienced nearly
16 inches in two days _ brought flooding that took days to
dissipate. winds and flooding caused at least $200 million in
insured damages.


   irene killed seven people in south florida, all in broward
county. a mother, her two sons and a neighbor boy were electrocuted
in weston in calf-deep water when they stepped into a puddle
containing a downed power line while walking their dog during a
lull in the storm. a 13-year-old cooper city boy died when he
grabbed a downed power line as he waded through 18 inches of water
during the storm. and two people drowned after driving into canals
next to flooded roads.


   ``irene is a reminder that october is a busy month,'' national
hurricane center forecaster richard pasch said last week. ``florida
gets a lot of hurricane hits in october; we saw it frequently in
the 1930s and 1940s. that's a reality check.''


   floyd was larger than life as it bore down on the florida
peninsula sept. 12, with top sustained winds of 155 _ about the
same strength as andrew. florida's salvation was a giant trough
that forecasters said would begin steering floyd away from shore
about 24 hours ahead of projected landfall, which at the time
looked more and more like downtown west palm beach. the storm did
turn on time that night, but not before nerve-wracked residents
boarded up and chewed fingernails. procrastinators fighting for
plywood caused turmoil at home improvement stores.


   floyd later straddled the coast through the carolinas to new
england, bringing catastrophic flooding to north carolina and new
jersey and killing at least 69 people _ the largest u.s. loss of
life since agnes in 1972. early damage estimates were at least $3
billion.


   another storm, dennis, had come ashore in the carolinas on aug.
30 and gone out to sea, but returned and savaged the north carolina
coast for a week, bringing heavy rains, gale force winds and
flooding. seven people died.


   as is often the case, the deadliest storm wasn't the strongest
or the wettest. it wasn't even a tropical storm. a tropical
depression formed off mexico's yucatan peninsula oct. 4 and came
ashore northeast of the coastal resort of veracruz; that weather
system and another one next to it brought torrential rains that
caused flooding and mud slides that may have killed as many as 400.


   just as people were starting to take down their shutters, lenny
sprang to life in mid-november, racing from the gulf of mexico east
through the caribbean. it killed 13 people in the virgin and
leeward islands before fizzling on sunday, only nine days before
the official end of hurricane season.

"hurricane georges reaches cuba; florida keys evacuation under way


	   port-au-prince, haiti (ap) _ hurricane georges reached cuba and
threatened the florida keys wednesday after making a shambles of
much of puerto rico, the dominican republic and haiti in a furious
march that killed at least 50 people and probably many more.
	   in florida, up to 100,000 people were ordered to begin
evacuating the exposed florida keys, and cars, trucks and sport
utility vehicles streamed along the highway linking the island
chain to the florida mainland.
	   south florida was put under a hurricane watch and gov. lawton
chiles declared a state of emergency in central and southern
florida, allowing the state to use the national guard, lift tolls
along evacuation routes and purchase emergency supplies.
	   the cayman islands issued tropical storm warnings for little
cayman and cayman brac.
	   the hurricane first hit the small islands of the northeast
caribbean early monday, killing three in st. kitts _ where the
government estimated damage at dlrs 445 million _ and two in
antigua.
	   the u.s. virgin islands, which were badly battered in recent
hurricanes, suffered some damage to homes, tourist facilities and
utilities; on the island of st. croix, a looter shot and killed a
man while burglarizing his home.
	   the effects of the storm were expected to be felt as far south
as jamaica, where officials expected heavy rains.
	   three people were killed directly by the storm in puerto rico,
where the government's insurance commissioner, juan garcia,
estimated damages at dlrs 1 billion. another eight, most of them
elderly, died of heart attacks or asthma complications during the
storm.
	   on wednesday reconstruction efforts were under way in
communities like loiza, where many homes of wood and zinc roofs
were crushed and washed away.
	   ``my sister's house is all gone. and that used to be my uncle's
house,'' said luis manso, pointing to a nearby pile of wood debris
as he struggled to repair his own shattered fruit and vegetable
stand ``quickly, before the thieves come.''
	   the federal emergency management agency reported that about a
third of puerto rico's power was expected back wednesday, but
715,000 remained without running water. fema said airport damage
was minimal and the port of san juan reported no major damage.
coffee and plantain crops, however, were badly harmed, fema said.
	   seventeen were officially reported killed in the dominican
republic, which georges hit tuesday. however, the actual toll
appears to have been much higher.
	   reporters said that in san cristobal, which is 20 miles (30
kilometers) east of santo domingo, the nizao river overflowed and
knocked down a part of a school used as a shelter, killing five,
and 31 were missing. unconfirmed media reports put the death toll
much higher, and officials planned a news conference on the
situation later wednesday.
	   in the shanty neighborhood of la cienega, the swollen river
invaded thousands of homes, covering some up to the roofs in fetid
water. residents swam to their houses to try to retrieve their
belongings, some using empty water jugs tied to their arms to help
them float.
	   earlier, looters in santo domingo waded waist-deep in water,
balancing televisions and air conditioners on their heads as 110
mph (180 kph) winds toppled trees and crushed houses. bands of
youths with machetes and pistols roamed the streets, many of them
drunk. two of the dead were looters shot by police enforcing a
curfew.
	   from the dominican republic georges proceeded tuesday night to
haiti, occupying the western third of the island of hispaniola.
	   in the poorest country in the western hemisphere, georges
unleashed flash floods and killed at least 17.
	   yolaine surena of the civil defense authority said the
government could spare only dlrs 130,000 in emergency aid.
	   most of the deaths reportedly occurred when floodwaters
collapsed two homes in the capital, port-au-prince, where there
were no public shelters. four drowning victims were found in a
west-side suburb wednesday a"

   holden beach, n.c._with the hurricane season's first tropical
storm, alex, already dissipated into a few puffs of wind off the
leeward islands, this coastal north carolina town's new $1 million
sand dune still is untouched and seemingly invincible.


   but locals know that if a big storm blows in, the manmade dune
guarding $400,000 beachfront homes would be as vulnerable as a
child's sand castle at high tide.


   ``that dune looks nice, and it makes you feel like you've got a
little security,'' said wayne thompson, 42, a sun-beaten contractor
who stays busy rebuilding decks and walkways damaged by the
beachfront erosion. ``but you get a hurricane in here, it won't
last.''


   this summer's high tides are actually nibbling away at portions
of holden beach's 4 1/2 mile-long dune, a nail-biting reminder that
these barrier islands are even more fragile two years after
hurricanes bertha and fran plowed ashore 15 miles east of here at
the cape fear river.


   ``we are about as prepared as we can be,'' said mike morgan,
manager of holden beach, a popular family beach enjoying one of its
best summers in years. ``we have our fingers crossed.''


   up and down the east coast, the anticipation of hurricane season
is as enduring a summertime ritual as eating fried seafood at
calabash, n.c., and shag-dancing at myrtle beach. tourism worth
billions of dollars drives coastal economies from key west to nags
head, n.c., and for the past two years beach towns have been riding
a lucky streak.


   during 1997 and so far this summer, the east coast has been
spared from hurricanes, but even with alex's breakup, forecasters
were predicting trouble for the east coast. following the remnants
of alex was a large tropical wave about midway between the lesser
antilles and the cape verde islands sunday that could brew into a
storm. weather watchers also have warned of the potential for
greater hurricane activity from the emerging la nina, the weather
counter-balance to spring's troublesome el nino.


   it is unusual for the african tropics to spawn storms such as
alex this early in the hurricane season, forecasters say. but when
they do, they typically signal that the remainder of the season
will be active, as was the case two summers ago when north carolina
suffered the one-two punch of hurricanes bertha and fran.


   bertha hit on july 12, 1996, softening up the coastal defenses
for the sept. 5 assault by fran, north carolina's most costly
natural disaster with damages of an estimated $6.5 billion and 22
deaths. the destruction reached as far inland as raleigh, but was
most punishing on topsail island, a narrow spit northeast of
wilmington.


   federal aid to north carolina in disaster-assistance grants,
loans and payments was an estimated $1 billion.


   the beaches southwest of wilmington escaped with relatively
little damage. on holden beach, estimated damages of $200,000
included houses that lost shingles, siding and a small number of
decks. even so, people who've watched nor'easterns and other
unnamed storms eat away at these beaches say southeastern north
carolina's coastline is poorly prepared for a major assault.


   back in 1954, hurricane hazel cut holden beach in two, and more
than four decades later, the newly constructed beachfront dune
wouldn't stand a chance against a similar storm, experts said.


   ``before fran and bertha, the beaches were in bad shape,'' said
bill cleary, a geology professor at the university of north
carolina at wilmington. ``they are even more vulnerable to storms
because the beaches have not rebuilt as they were expected to
rebuild.''


   cleary's studies at unc-wilmington's center for marine science
research have found that big storms push sand far off shore, rather
than deposit on the ocean floor just beyond the low-tide mark. the
result, he said, is narrow beaches that provide little resistance
to the punishing tidal surges that accompany big storms.


   cleary called holden beach's dune a ``band-aid approach that
would not last at all.''


   morgan, holden beach's manager,"

 hurricane georges lashes southern florida 


washington, september 25 (xinhua) -- hurricane georges lashed
the florida keys friday morning, sending waves crashing onto
streets and knocking out power, tv and other media reports said.


shelters and hotels from miami to orlando filled up after more
than 1 million people from key west to tampa were urged or
ordered to leave coastal and low-lying areas and mobile homes
before the storm came.


the storm, having killed more than 300 people in the caribbean,
was expected to attack the northern gulf coast after it leaves
southern florida.


a hail of leaves, branches and palm fronds blew across the
overseas highway in marathon, in the middle keys, and strong wind
lifted rainwater off roofs. some 150,000 people lost power as the
edges of the storm lashed the miami and fort lauderdale areas.


at 11 a.m. edt, georges' eye was about 25 kilometers south of
key west. the eye was expected to pass west of key west by late
morning and the storm was expected to move into the gulf of mexico.


a hurricane warning was posted for the keys and the gulf coast
north to longboat key. the coast from longboat key to bayport was
under a tropical storm warning.


about 2,500 members of the national guard were ordered to be
ready for hurricane assignments. four c-130 cargo aircraft were
reserved to fly troops to the keys for post-storm security.


the storm landed the keys area shortly before sunset thursday.
wind and rain became more steady and rendered 4,000 people without
power.


georges is the first major hurricane to hit southern florida
since andrew, which caused 25 billion u.s. dollars damage in the
state in 1992 and killed 26 people."

 floyd strengthens, nears bahamas 


	nassau, bahamas (ap) -- hurricane floyd strengthened to a very  
dangerous category 4 storm today with 155 mph wind, surprising 
forecasters and charging toward the bahamas on a path that also 
threatened the florida coast. 


	heavy rain started falling in parts of the bahamas today as  
residents scrambled for emergency supplies, shelters opened, 
schools closed and shop owners boarded up windows. 


	mandatory evacuations were ordered in exposed coastal areas of  
both the bahamas and florida's brevard county. workers also started 
leaving nasa's kennedy space center, on a barrier island standing 
only 9 feet above sea level. 


	``i have never been this scared about a storm,'' said bahamas  
resident angel chea, manager of a graphics shop, as she boarded up 
her windows. 


	``we need people to get ready right now, not tonight, not  
tomorrow,'' said joan heller, a spokeswoman for brevard county. 


	because of uncertainty about the huge storm's path, a hurricane  
watch area on the mainland was expanded today, reaching all the way 
from the miami area northward into georgia, the u.s. national 
hurricane center said in miami. 


	``it's capable of almost catastrophic destruction,'' said todd  
kimberlain, a forecaster at the hurricane center. 


	floyd had top sustained wind today of nearly 155 mph. that put  
it on the verge of becoming a category 5 storm, which features top 
sustained wind of more than 156 mph and is capable of causing 
extreme damage. by comparison, hurricane andrew had category 4 
status when it struck south florida in 1992, killing 26 people and 
causing an estimated $25 billion in damage. 


	however, the hurricane center said little additional  
strengthening was likely by midday tuesday. 


	only two category 5 hurricanes have struck the united states  
since record-keeping began, the labor day hurricane of 1935, which 
destroyed the railroad connecting the florida keys to the mainland 
and killed 423 people, and camille in 1969, which killed 256 people 
along the gulf coast and in virginia. 


	if floyd continued on a track toward central florida, nasa  
planned to shut down the kennedy space center by midnight tonight, 
leaving none of its 12,500 workers behind to ride out the storm. 
the center is only 9 feet above sea level, so a storm surge as well 
as wind could be a problem. 


	all four space shuttles were in hangars, but four  
multimillion-dollar rockets were on launch pads and couldn't be 
moved. 


	all of the northwest and central bahamian islands were under  
hurricane warnings today. a tropical storm warning was posted for 
the southeastern bahamas and the nearby british turks and caicos 
islands. 


	a hurricane watch on the mainland was extended from the miami  
area northward all the way to near brunswick, ga. 


	in the middle of the watch area, florida's brevard county  
ordered tens of thousands of people living in mobile homes and 
coastal areas to evacuate beginning at 4 p.m. today. 


	``there are different tracks that have been projected and we  
don't come out unscathed on any of them,'' said brevard county 
spokeswoman joan heller. 


	at 2 p.m., floyd's center was about 90 miles east of san  
salvador in the central bahamas, and about 470 miles east-southeast 
of miami. it was headed west at nearly 15 mph, and was expected to 
gradually turn to a west-northwesterly-heading by evening, with a 
further turn toward the northwest on tuesday. 


	hurricane-force wind extended 105 miles from its center with  
tropical storm-force wind stretching outward up to 290 miles. 


	forecasters estimated storm surge conditions could reach 15 to  
20 feet for the northwest bahamas. 


	floyd grew unexpectedly into a monster of a storm on sunday.  


	``i didn't expect such a very fast intensification,'' said jerry  
jarrell, director of the national hurricane center. ``this is a 
real surprise for us.'' 


	far out at sea, gert strengthened into a hurricane today with  
sustained wind increasing to 75 mph. at 11"

"hurricane bret leaves texans feeling lucky   
(dw)



   houston _ the remnants of hurricane bret moved into northern
mexico on tuesday after officials in the texas border town of
laredo blamed heavy rainfall from the storm for a traffic accident
in which four people were killed.


   officials in laredo had feared that the storm would stall over
the low-lying city and repeat the heavy flooding that tropical
storm charlie brought last year to another texas border town, del
rio. instead, the storm kept moving, causing sporadic flooding in
laredo but no serious damage there.


   ``we dodged a major bullet,'' said jerry garza, a spokesman for
the city of laredo. garza said city officials had declared a state
of emergency after the national weather service predicted up to 20
inches of rain, which might have caused the creeks throughout the
city to overflow. ``the creeks filled up,'' garza said, ``but it
stopped raining.''


   designated category 4, or extremely dangerous, because of its
145 mile-per-hour winds, the storm veered away from heavily
populated corpus christi and came ashore on sunday in kenedy
county, a rural expanse of pasture land with only 460 people. once
ashore, the storm quickly weakened and was downgraded to a tropical
storm by monday morning.


   mike cox, a spokesman for the texas department of public safety,
said officials had estimated that casualties could have been as
high as 1,500 people if the storm had delivered a direct blow to
corpus christi. instead, it meandered westward from kenedy county
through areas with few, if any, people. the national weather
service estimated that the storm had dropped from 25 to 35 inches
of rain in kenedy county.


   ``we were very lucky,'' said brian lamarre, a weather service
meteorologist. ``if it had landed in corpus christi or houston or
any populated area, it would have caused phenomenal damage. as it
was, it turned out to be a rainmaker.''


   as thousands of evacuees continued to return home on tuesday
from inland shelters and hotels, utility workers all but restored
electricity in affected areas. the texas public utility commission
reported that 3,000 people remained without power but predicted
that all power would be restored by wednesday. nearly 3,000 people
remained without telephone service.


   the fatal traffic accident in laredo occurred on monday
afternoon as heavy rains from the storm deluged the city. officials
said that a tractor-trailer truck jackknifed on a rainy, windy
highway and smashed into a pickup truck. three people in the pickup
were killed, as was the driver of the tractor-trailer.


   ``that accident happened right when the really heavy part of
tropical storm bret starting affecting laredo,'' garza said."

   miami _ hurricane georges, the deadliest storm of this hurricane
season, pounded the island of hispaniola, shared by the dominican
republic and haiti, and pushed late tuesday toward cuba and the
u.s. mainland, threatening to hit south florida by late thursday or
early friday.


   packing winds of 120 mph when it slammed into the dominican
capital of santo domingo, georges was expected to leave hispaniola
devastated. the two-nation island is home to 15 million people,
many of whom live in substandard housing.


   at least 13 deaths have been attributed to georges during its
surge through the northern caribbean. on tuesday, the formidable
storm knocked out power and forced residents into shelters across
the densely populated dominican republic, where two people were
killed by downed electrical lines and a third by a collapsing wall.


   the storm already had claimed at least 10 lives in the
caribbean, including five in puerto rico, where it left widespread
damage monday.


   officials expected to issue a hurricane watch some time todayfor
south florida, where residents packed the stores in search of
supplies such as batteries, flashlights and water.


   georges was expected to weaken somewhat as it moved off the
shore of hispaniola, but not below hurricane strength. as of 5 p.m.
edt tuesday, georges had sustained winds of 110 mph.


   still, forecasters at the national hurricane center predicted
that georges would pack much less of a punch than hurricane andrew,
which caused billions of dollars in damage in densely populated
south florida in 1992.


   on tuesday, workers placed shutters over the windows at city
hall in key west, while authorities advised all visitors and
non-residents of the florida keys to evacuate the island chain,
whose only connection to the mainland is a two-lane highway.


   ``we anticipate most of the evacuations will occur on
wednesday,'' said billy wagner, an official with the monroe county
emergency management service. ``anyone who's got plans to visit the
keys should postpone them.''


   in the caribbean, georges had paralyzed santo domingo, a city of
3 million, by mid-afternoon, flooding streets, uprooting trees, and
whisking away tin roofs and satellite dishes.


   meanwhile, officials expected a high death toll in haiti due to
the unsafe living conditions of thousands of desperately poor
haitians. in haiti's capital of port-au-prince, which is surrounded
by slums, fragile communities of cardboard homes cling to slippery
hillsides.


   ``people die here even when we just get a heavy downpour, one
that's not even a tropical storm, so this could be catastrophic for
us,'' said michelle karshan, a spokeswoman for haiti's president
rene preval.


   when tropical storm gordon, a much weaker system than georges,
struck haiti in 1994, hundreds of people were killed in mudslides.


   hurricane warnings were posted tuesday for haiti, eastern cuba,
the southwestern bahamas and the turks and caicos islands, and a
hurricane watch was in effect in parts of cuba and the bahamas on
tuesday.


   on monday and early tuesday, georges wreaked havoc across the
northeast caribbean. with gusts of up to 130 mph, the hurricane
dumped two feet of water in the mountains of puerto rico, while
bending palm trees and flipping small aircraft like they were
pancakes.


   on tuesday, all of the u.s. territory's 3.8 million people were
without power, and 80 percent of people were without running water,
while more than 25,000 people sought refuge in shelters.


   the airport in san juan, puerto rico was able to operate tuesday
for relief flights, but remained closed to other traffic.


   ``we are starting from ground zero,'' puerto rico's gov. pedro
rossello said of recovery efforts.

   miami _ hurricane georges pounded the island of hispaniola,
shared by the dominican republic and haiti, and pushed late tuesday
toward cuba and the u.s. mainland, distracting south florida
residents who began preparing for the fury of this hurricane
season's deadliest storm.


   packing winds of 120 mph at midday, georges was expected to
devastate hispaniola, home to 15 million people, many of whom live
in substandard housing.


   the formidable storm knocked out power and forced residents into
shelters across the densely populated dominican republic, where two
people were killed by downed electrical lines.


   georges had paralyzed the dominican republic's capital of santo
domingo by mid-afternoon, where it flooded streets, uprooted trees,
and whisked away tin roofs and satellite dishes.


   meanwhile, officials expected a high death toll in haiti due to
the unsafe living conditions of thousands of desperately poor
haitians.


   in haiti's capital of port-au-prince, which is surrounded by
slums, fragile communities of cardboard homes cling to slippery
hillsides.


   ``people die here even when we just get a heavy downpour, one
that's not even a tropical storm, so this could be catastrophic for
us,'' said michelle karshan, a spokeswoman for haiti's president
rene preval.


   when tropical storm gordon, a much weaker system than georges,
struck haiti in 1994, hundreds of people were killed in mudslides.


   meanwhile, forecasters predicted georges could affect
southernmost florida by late thursday or early friday. the national
hurricane center in miami was expected to place parts of south
florida under a hurricane watch late tuesday.


   workers placed shutters over the windows at city hall in key
west, while authorities advised all visitors and non-residents of
the florida keys to evacuate the island chain who's only connection
to the mainland is a two-lane highway.


   ``we anticipate most of the evacuations will occur on
wednesday,'' said billy wagner, an official with the monroe county
emergency management service. ``anyone who's got plans to visit the
keys should postpone them.''


   hurricane warnings were posted for haiti, eastern cuba, the
southwestern bahamas and the turks and caicos islands, and a
hurricane watch was in effect in parts of cuba and the bahamas on
tuesday.


   officials expected to issue a hurricane watch some time
wednesday for south florida, where residents packed the stores in
search of supplies such as batteries, flashlights and water.


   georges was expected to weaken somewhat as it moved off the
shore of hispaniola, but not below hurricane strength. as of 5 p.m.
edt tuesday, georges had sustained winds of 110 mph.


   still, forecasters at the national hurricane center predicted
that georges would pack much less of a punch than hurricane andrew,
which caused billions of dollars in damage in densely populated
south florida in 1992.


   on monday and early tuesday, georges wreaked havoc across the
northeast caribbean, killing at least 10 people, mostly due to
mudslides and collapsed roofs.


   boasting gusts of up to 130 mph, the hurricane dumped two feet
of water in the mountains of puerto rico, while bending palm trees
and flipping small aircraft like they were pancakes.


   on tuesday, all of the u.s. territory's 3.8 million people were
without power, and 80 percent of people were without running water,
while more than 25,000 people sought refuge in shelters.


   the airport in san juan, puerto rico was able to operate tuesday
for relief flights, but remained closed to other traffic.


   ``we are starting from ground zero,'' puerto rico's gov. pedro
rossello said of recovery efforts.


   president clinton declared puerto rico and the u.s. virgin
islands disaster areas, authorizing immediate release of federal
recovery aid. scores of federal and red cross officials fanned
across the island to assess damage, expected to soar to hundreds of
millions of dollars.


   in antigua, the storm split open government-built houses and
ripped corrugated roofs off hu"

 carolina coast dodges hurricane 


	nags head, n.c. (ap) -- hurricane dennis weakened and slowed to a  
near halt today just off the coast, leaving relatively sparse 
property damage in its wake along the north carolina seaboard. 


	``all in all, we did dodge a bullet,'' danny couch, owner of a  
shopping center in buxton, said monday evening. ``it was a pretty 
impressive system.'' 


	a hurricane warning along the north carolina coast was  
downgraded to a tropical storm warning but forecasters said it was 
too early to write off dennis completely. 


	dennis, almost stationary this morning, could linger without  
moving much through saturday, said rod gonski, forecaster at the 
national weather service office in raleigh. ``it likes that moist, 
warm air on the gulf stream, and that's where it's centered now,'' 
he said. 


	if it starts moving again, it's just as likely to head south or  
southwest as it is to reverse course toward the outer banks or 
southeastern virginia, gonski said. 


	``there's a chance it could come back, a little less than 50-50,  
but certainly worth talking about for sure,'' he said. ``there is 
nothing nudging it out in the ocean right now.'' 


	because of the uncertainty about the storm, people have started  
calling oceanfront hotels in southeastern virginia to cancel 
reservations for labor day weekend. 


	dennis ``puts a lot of things into sort of a holding pattern,''  
said jimmy capps, president of the virginia beach hotel-motel 
association. ``what we probably need to do is give it another day 
and see where it's going to be.'' 


	at 11 a.m. today, dennis was nearly stationary about 150 miles  
east of cape hatteras, the national hurricane center said. its 
motion was expected to continue to be slow and erratic at least 
into wednesday morning. its maximum sustained wind had slowed to 
about 75 mph, barely above the minimum wind speed for a hurricane. 


	in addition to north carolina, the tropical storm warning  
stretched northward to chincoteague, va., and a gale warning 
extended from there to great egg inlet, n.j. 


	for a time monday, it seemed yet another hurricane might cross  
cape fear, directly south of wilmington, just like bertha and fran 
in 1996 and bonnie in 1998. fran killed 25 people and caused up to 
$6 billion in damage. 


	but just as dennis approached the outer banks, it began edging  
away. 


	the storm's eye stayed 60 miles from shore, but it still  
pummeled the coast with high wind and up to 8 inches of rain. 


	two people died monday in onslow county in a head-on car  
collision blamed on poor visibility from wind and rain. a surfer's 
death saturday at st. augustine beach, fla., was attributed to 
heavy surf from dennis. 


	in dare county, a coast guard helicopter rescued four men from a  
small boat that was blown into a marsh after its engine failed in 
the 30-foot surf. 


	on hatteras island, the ocean washed out route 12, the only  
highway along the narrow barrier island. part of the road was 
closed near kitty hawk and up to 3 feet of sand covered the 
highway. 


	farther south, the community of cedar island in carteret county  
was cut off by high water, and ocracoke island was drenched by rain 
and waves. 


	``the whole village was covered with water ... 6 feet above sea  
level,'' hyde county manager jeff credle said of the town of 
ocracoke. 


	damage on ocracoke island can't be estimated until the water  
recedes, he said. 


	cindy babbitt rode out the storm in her hatteras landing marina,  
just across the inlet from ocracoke. ``we're faring ok,'' she said. 
``i tried to look outside, but the rain is so sideways i can't 
see.'' 


	storm damage was light. new hanover's losses totaled $217,000,  
while in brunswick county, the collapse of a beachfront house at 
ocean isle beach was the worst property damage reported, said cecil 
logan of the county emergency management office. 


	utility companies said about 67,000 customers in coastal and  
inland counties lost power. the outages stretched as far i"

"georges plows into dominican republic after raging through puerto


	   santo domingo, dominican republic (ap) _ after plowing through
the northern caribbean, hurricane georges carved into the dominican
republic on tuesday, uprooting trees and churning the sea as
dominicans and tourists alike fled to shelter.
	   the mammoth storm was on a trajectory that could send it
crashing into the florida keys by late thursday or early friday.
authorities urged tourists to leave the island chain, as residents
began boarding up windows in anticipation of georges' fury.
	   the storm caught the dominican capital of santo domingo almost
entirely unprepared tuesday. forecasters had expected it to hit
only the northern coast, but georges, which killed at least 10
people in its furious march across the caribbean, changed course
and headed straight for the tropical capital of 3 million people.
	   even more than in puerto rico, where georges exploded shop and
car windows, flipped small airplanes and whisked away satellite
dishes, the damage was expected to be extensive.
	   in this poor u.s. territory where the minimum wage is about dlrs
140 a month, the wooden houses that line riverbeds and hillsides
would be no match for the storm's 110 mph (175 kph) winds.
	   in neighboring haiti, which shares the island of hispaniola and
is also in the storm's path, people prepared to battle the
hurricane amid even more profound poverty.
	   as the darkness approached, dominican president leonel fernandez
told his countrymen the island's fate was in god's hands.
	   ``for the moment, the only thing left for us to do is to raise
our prayers to the almighty,'' said the president.
	   hurricane warnings were in effect from the dominican republic to
eastern cuba and the southeastern bahamas. the u.s. national
weather service said a hurricane watch may be needed late tuesday
or early wednesday for the northwest bahamas and south florida.
	   david chorney, a meteorologist at the national hurricane center
in miami, said there was ``a pretty good probability'' that georges
would hit florida.
	   ``as far as intensity, it's still too early to tell what it's
going to do,'' he said. after crossing the caribbean islands and
getting back over water, he said, ``there's a good chance it could
redevelop and strengthen again.''
	   the storm had already caused what is expected to amount to
hundreds of millions of dollars in damage in puerto rico, where the
entire island lost power and most had their water cut. five people
were killed on the island and tens of thousands took refuge in
shelters.
	   in the capital of san juan, where almost half the island's
people live, downed power lines and trees fell onto flooded roads,
making some impassable.
	   on tuesday, residents began the sobering task of recovery.
	   ``after the storm is always the worst,'' said paula aponte
figueroa, 71, as she swatted at mosquitoes in the musty heat, the
roof of her house ripped off by the winds. ``there's flooding,
there are mosquitoes and i have nowhere to go.''
	   the strength of georges' winds was evident as it ripped the roof
off the cab of a water tanker truck passing through santo domingo,
flipping it onto the hood of the vehicle. the driver continued on,
hanging out the window to see where he was going.
	   some people stood in whipping winds tuesday morning trying to
nail plywood boards over their windows. many residents simply sat
back and waited.
	   authorities in santo domingo didn't open shelters until tuesday
morning, hours after strong winds and heavy bursts of rain had
reached the capital. people continued to stream into shelters even
as the full force of georges hit.
	   power went out even before the full force of the hurricane hit.
hotels evacuated tourists from their rooms overnight and put them
up in conference rooms or ballrooms.
	   there was no word on casualties in the dominican republic. as
georges moved into the east of hispaniola, communication was cut
between the capital and the east of the island.
	   earlier, president bill clinton declared puerto rico"

   west palm beach, fla. _ a massive storm named floyd became the
fourth hurricane of the season friday and forecasters fear it will
become a monster.


   while it's too early to tell whether it will strike south
florida, the storm took an eerie path friday, landing in the same
position as hurricane andrew in 1992, said national weather service
meteorologist jim lushine.


   but while andrew moved faster on its atlantic trek, floyd is
progressing more slowly and gathering strength from warm tropical
waters, strength that forecasters say will ultimately make it a
category 3 storm with winds up to 130 mph.


   floyd should reach the central bahama islands monday afternoon
with winds of up to about 110 mph, forecasters said.


   on thursday, they issued a tropical storm watch for the northern
leeward islands as strong winds from the storm's outer bands
stretched about 175 miles.


   as of late friday, floyd was located about 415 miles east,
northeast of puerto rico with sustained winds of 80 mph.


   ``people need to know there's a real threat out there and the
southeast is not off the hook,'' said max mayfield, deputy director
of the national hurricane center. ``it will likely turn north
eventually, but what we can't say is whether that will happen off
the coast or inland.''


   floyd formed earlier this week off africa's cape verdi islands
as a typical september tropical wave. the national hurricane center
issued its first advisory tuesday. when the center's plane visited
the storm early friday, it discovered floyd had grown to hurricane
strength.


   hurricane hunters plan to return to the storm today and the next
three days to gather information to be fed into the center's
computer models that predict the storm's course, mayfield said.


   forecasters are particularly troubled by a weather trough over
the southeastern united states that helped steer hurricane dennis
offshore earlier this month.


   ``unfortunately, it's not going to remain there by the time
floyd gets up to the southeastern coast,'' mayfield said. ``it will
gradually lift to the northeast and what we're concerned about is
that a ridge of high pressure will build north of the hurricane. if
that does happen, it will allow a more west, northwest motion.''


   still, forecasters say another trough should move over the
central united states during the next four days.


   ``depending on how far east it gets will determine in part what
happens to floyd,'' mayfield said.


   during the day friday, floyd became better organized and even
produced an eye briefly in the afternoon, forecasters said. because
of its size, lushine compared the storm to hurricane hugo, the 1989
storm that blasted charleston, s.c., and caused $6 billion in
damages.


   ``hugo had winds that extended out 200 miles and hurricane winds
out 100 miles whereas (1992's hurricane andrew) had hurricane winds
half that size,'' he said.


   ``andrew was really a symmetrical storm in terms of
thunderstorms around it, that were all equal distance from the
center. this storm and hugo are asymmetric, which has implications
in terms of its outer effects. tornadoes are more likely because
there are more outer bands to have tornadoes in and because it's
much bigger, it's much wetter.''


   for most of the weekend, palm beach county and the treasure
coast will have warm calm weather, with highs in the upper 80s and
90s and lows in the 70s. there is a 40 percent chance of afternoon
showers.

"hurricanes _ from arlene to zelda 
 for immediate release 
 from the fort worth star-telegram



   what is a hurricane?


   a hurricane is an intense tropical storm that has winds of 74
mph and higher, according to the national hurricane center.


   these winds blow in a large spiral around a calm center, called
the ``eye.'' the eye is 20-30 miles wide. in the northern
hemisphere of the earth, winds move counterclockwise around the
eye. in the southern hemisphere, winds circulate clockwise.


   hurricanes develop over tropical ocean waters and many remain
there. when a hurricane does approach land, skies begin to darken
and winds strengthen. the hurricane begins driving water ahead of
it in a storm surge or tidal wave that can be 20 feet at its peak.
hurricanes can also trigger tornadoes and floods.


   how are hurricanes named?


   the world meteorological organization has chosen an alphabetical
list of names for tropical storms and hurricanes, and the list
rotates every six years. that practice started in 1953. names used
for storms this year are the same that were used in 1993.


   the names of tropical storms and hurricanes used to be all
women's names until 1978 and '79. now, men's names are alternated
with women's.


   sometimes, when a hurricane is particularly destructive, the
name is retired, which means the name can't be used for at least 10
years.


   one such name was hurricane andrew, which struck florida and
louisiana in 1992. the storm caused 54 deaths and up to $30 billion
in damage.


   to put that in context, the galveston, texas hurricane of 1900
(before hurricanes were named) caused 6,000 deaths, the most in
u.s. history, according to the world almanac and book of facts.


   where and when are most hurricanes in the united states?


   florida has the most hurricanes in the united states, the
national hurricane center reports.


   other places vulnerable to hurricanes are the coasts along the
gulf of mexico and the north atlantic ocean, from texas to maine.


   the hurricane season is from june 1 to nov. 30, and peak months
are august and september.


   which hurricanes and tropical storms have formed in the atlantic
ocean this year?


   arlene: this tropical storm formed on june 11 and spent its life
at sea in the central atlantic. winds reached 65 mph.


   bret: this hurricane struck the texas coast near corpus christi
and brownsville on aug. 22. it had winds of 125 mph.


   cindy: this hurricane formed near the cape verde islands west of
the african country of senegal but did not come ashore. on aug. 28,
it reached its peak intensity of 140 mph.


   dennis: this storm formed on aug. 23, became a hurricane on aug.
26 and reached 105 mph on aug. 28. it moved up the southeast u.s.
coast and struck the north carolina coast on aug. 30.


   emily: this tropical storm formed on aug. 24 and reached wind
speeds of 65 mph.


   floyd: this storm was upgraded to a hurricane on sept. 10,
reaching peak winds of 155 mph. blowing from the bahamas to the
carolinas to new england, it caused 60 deaths, immense flooding of
roads and buildings, and mass road closures and power outages. walt
disney world was closed for bad weather for the first time in its
history.


   gert: winds from this storm reached 130 to 145 mph on sept. 17
and caused damage to structures and beaches in bermuda. the
hurricane weakened to a tropical storm on sept. 23.


   harvey: this tropical storm formed in the gulf of mexico on
sept. 19 and dumped 10 inches of rain on south florida.


   what are this year's names for hurricanes?


   here's the list of names for hurricanes and tropical storms that
have occurred or might develop in the north atlantic ocean, gulf of
mexico and caribbean sea:


   arlene, bret, cindy, dennis, emily, floyd, gert, harvey, irene,
jose, katrina, lenny, maria, nate, ophelia, philipe, rita, stan,
tammy, vince and wilma.
