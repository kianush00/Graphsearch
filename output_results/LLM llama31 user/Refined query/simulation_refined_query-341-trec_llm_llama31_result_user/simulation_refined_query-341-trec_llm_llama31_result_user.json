With the increase in international terrorism and in the wake of the TWA Flight 800 disaster, articles on airport security relating in particular to additional steps taken by airports to increase flight safety would be relevant.  The mere mention of enhanced security does not constitute relevance.  Additional steps refer to something beyond just passenger and carry-on screening using the normal methods. Examples of new steps would be additional personnel, sophisticated monitoring and screening devices, and extraordinary measures to check luggage in the baggage compartment.\n\n\nYou are a classifier for \"airport security screening enhancements\" on international flights.\n\nRELEVANT if **ANY** of these hold:\n\n- The document names a specific airport or country and describes new measures implemented (e. g. additional personnel, sophisticated monitoring and screening devices, etc.) beyond just passenger and carry-on screening using the normal methods\n- It explains how these measures differ from the usual screening procedures\n- It reports on outcomes, effectiveness, or evaluations of these measures\n\nNON-RELEVANT if any of these hold:\n\n- It only refers to standard passenger or carry-on screening methods\n- It discusses airport security in general terms or policy announcements without relating to additional steps to increase flight safety.\n- It covers the TWA Flight 800 incident background without linking to post-incident screening improvements.\n\nNEGATIVE Example:\nTitle: \"Airports Ramp Up Metal-Detector Checks After TWA 800\"\nrelevant: false\njustification: \"Mentions standard metal-detector use but no new measures beyond existing procedures.\"\n\nPOSITIVE Example:\nTitle: \"London Heathrow Deploys 3D CT Scanners for All Carry-On Bags\"\nrelevant: true\njustification: \"Airport: Heathrow; New measures: 3D CT baggage scanners replacing X-ray; Outcomes: 30 % increase in explosive detection rates with minimal delay.\"",

Ms. \nSchiavo said the bag contained several items, including a cellular \nphone wire. \n\n\n\tAirport officials said a suspicious bag had been spotted and was  \nnot placed on the flight, but it declined to say whether the bag \nbelonged to Ms. Schiavo. \n\n\n\t``Currently we're investigating to determine if any law was  \nviolated,'' FBI spokesman Frank Scafidi said Sunday. \n\n\n\tPaul Takemoto, FAA spokesman, said that the Federal Aviation  \nAdministration was looking into whether its regulations were \nviolated in any way. \n\n\n\tThe bag's discovery led to a shutdown of a runway for four hours  \nFriday, but no flights were delayed. \n\n\n\tMs. Schiavo said Sunday that she bought a ticket to Washington,  \nD.C., and checked her bag with America West Airlines, but did not \nboard the flight. She said she was hoping to determine whether the \nbag would be allowed to take off with the flight even though its \nowner was not on board. \n\n\n\tAs a security measure on international flights, bags are matched  \nto passengers. Such checks are not required for domestic \npassengers. \n\n\n\t``If that is indeed what happened, then I'm glad. That's an  \nimprovement,'' Ms. Schiavo said when told the bag was held from the \nflight. ``I'm very sorry that people were inconvenienced, but I did \nnot cause that.'' \n\n\n\tMs. Schiavo resigned from her federal post in 1996 after  \ncriticizing the FAA on several occasions. Since then she has \npublished a book accusing the FAA of sloppy inspections, lax \nairport security and disregard for bogus airplane parts.",

      "content": "1999-03-11 05:59:12 \n international \n 78 U.S. Airports to Undergo Security Reviews \n\n\n\tWASHINGTON (AP) -- Nearly 80 of the nation's largest airports  \nwill undergo an extensive security review by the Federal Aviation \nAdministration, as it cracks down on reported lapses in controlled \naccess to secured areas. \n\n\n\tThe FAA launched the six-week review after auditors in a survey  \nof five airports found inadequate safeguards for keeping \nunauthorized personnel out of secured areas. Once federal officials \nhave scrutinized security measures at the nation's 78 largest \ncommercial airports, they will then look into smaller commercial \nairports. \n\n\n\t``We decided it would be worthwhile to look at the issue of  \naccess to non-public areas of airports on a broader scale,'' FAA \nspokesman Eliot Brenner said Wednesday. The agency will also \ndetermine whether it needs to do ``red team testing'' -- such as \nsending undercover agents to try to penetrate security -- to ensure \nthat identified problem areas have been addressed after the review. \n\n\n\tThe FAA's security crackdown follows tests by federal agents at  \nfive major airports. Testifying before the House Appropriations \nCommittee's panel on transportation and related agencies, the \nauditors reported Wednesday they were able to bypass secured areas \nand even board the planes. \n\n\n\t``In a high percentage of tests involving airport access  \ncontrols, our successful penetration of secure areas almost always \nresulted in our boarding an aircraft,'' said Alexis Stefani, the \nTransportation Department's deputy assistant inspector general for \naviation. \n\n\n\tStefani told lawmakers many of the problems found in a similar  \naudit in 1993 still exist. For example, Stefani said, undercover \npersonnel could enter through emergency exits and penetrate air \ncargo facilities by following airport personnel through access \ncontrol points. \n\n\n\tThe majority of individuals encountered by the agents failed to  \nchallenge them for unauthorized access and in some cases, airport \nlaw enforcement officials failed to respond to emergency door \nalarms. At two airports, undercover auditors bypassed passenger \nscreening checkpoints and entered the concourse. \n\n\n\tStefani attributed the ``human element'' as the primary weakness  \nin keeping unauthorized personnel out of secured areas. \n\n\n\tThe FAA's inspection and testing of airport security also needs  \nstrengthening, Stefani said. \n\n\n\tThe agency sets guidelines and establishes procedures for  \nsecurity, while airports are responsible for controlling access to \nsecured areas within the facility. Airlines oversee passengers and \ncargo. Airports and airlines together have historically been \nresponsible for maintaining security equipment and systems. \n\n\n\tIn a letter sent to airports, Retired Adm. Cathal Flynn, the  \nFAA's associate administrator for civil aviation security, said \nunauthorized personnel sneaking past controlled access represents a \nserious security breech. \n\n\n\t``Allowing intruders to piggyback through access doors, not  \nchallenging intruders on the ramp, and intruders being able to get \naboard aircraft, combine to make a significant vulnerability,'' \nFlynn wrote. \n\n\n\tHe suggested that ``redundant measures, such as guarding the  \nindividual aircraft,'' could be required if the problems persist. \n\n\n\tThe Dallas Morning News reported in its Wednesday editions that  \nfederal agents were able to get through security doors 46 times at \nfour major airports, walk around on the tarmac and board 51 \nairplanes unchallenged.",

      "content": "FEDERAL AUTHORITIES CALL FOR BOOSTING SECURITY MEASURES AT\nAIRPORTS \n\n\n\n   Federal authorities, increasingly concerned about the\npossibility of a holiday terrorist attack, took additional steps\nTuesday to safeguard Americans by adding inspectors to monitor\nsecurity operations at airports.\n\n\n   The Federal Aviation Administration said that travelers should\nexpect stricter enforcement of parking regulations, and that it\nwould make more use of devices to check airline passengers for\nsmall traces of explosives. Additional bomb-sniffing dogs and\nuniformed police also will patrol airports as the new year\napproaches.\n\n\n   The concerns come after last week's arrest of an Algerian who\nbrought bomb-making material into Washington state from Canada.\n\n\n   Still, federal authorities say they have no evidence about\nspecific terrorist attacks on U.S. soil.\n\n\n   ``We don't want to overly concern people,'' said Jeff Lanza,\nspokesman for the FBI's Kansas City office. ``The chances of\nanything happening are very slim, but we want to take every\nprecaution.''\n\n\n   Kansas City International Airport officials have not planned any\nadditional security measures for the new year. KCI spokeswoman Tara\nSmith said Tuesday that the existing security measures at KCI\nalready are very strict.\n\n\n   ``We consider this an advisory rather than a mandate,'' Smith\nsaid of the FAA's action.\n\n\n   Airport police do not allow people to leave unattended vehicles\nat the curb. Numerous security cameras are mounted throughout KCI,\nand airport police have two dogs that can sniff suspicious-looking\nbags.\n\n\n   As in past years, KCI officials advise holiday travelers not to\ngift wrap items to carry aboard planes and to check in at least an\nhour before takeoff on domestic flights and two hours before\ninternational flights.\n\n\n   Authorities in Kansas City are allocating more manpower as the\nNew Year approaches and are working with planners of large-scale\nevents.\n\n\n   As many as 5,000 partiers will celebrate in Union Station,\nperhaps the area's biggest bash. Revelers will pay up to $500 for a\nblack-tie dinner, live music and fireworks. Up to 10,000 will\ncelebrate in tents outside.\n\n\n   Event organizer Stacy McCullough said police have worked with\norganizers from the start, even sitting in on planning meetings.\nPolice and private security will work at the event.\n\n\n   Partiers will pass through metal detectors as added protection.\n\n\n   ``We hope people keep things in perspective,'' McCullough said.\n``We're very comfortable with what we're doing. We're doing\neverything on our end to ensure a safe environment.''\n\n\n   The FBI's local office will set up a command post to monitor\ncriminal activities over New Year's and will contribute agents to a\nFederal Emergency Management Agency command post that opens this\nweek.\n\n\n   The FBI, like many businesses, has limited out-of-town travel\namong agents so they will be available.\n\n\n   The Kansas City Police Department plans to call most of its\nofficers in to work 12-hour shifts throughout the holiday. They\nwill be deployed throughout the city, not necessarily at\nhigh-profile events.\n\n\n   For the past two years, field supervisors have randomly\nparticipated in responding to mock critical incidents from Y2K\nproblems to natural disasters, said Officer Steve Young, a police\nspokesman.\n\n\n   Supervisors are asked how they would utilize resources such as\nthe Missouri Highway Patrol, MAST or the city's public works\ndepartment. Police also have met regularly with city and health\nofficials, Young said.\n\n\n   ``All we are doing is everything we can to be ready for\nanything,'' Young said.",

A U.S. travel advisory in 1985 produced\ndevastating results: the number of visits that year dropped to\njust 100,000 from 600,000 in 1984.\n\n\nGreek Prime Minister Costas Simitis reportedly intervened to\nstop the U.S. from issuing a travel advisory but Greek tour\noperators say that even with the less formal warning stickers,\nyears of effort to regain trust in the U.S. market could be\nwasted.\n\n\nOther senior officials, including the country's Transport\nMinister Haris Kastanidis, have also lashed out at the American\naction. Speaking to the press earlier, Kastanidis said Washington\nwas using the warning as a means of political pressure on Athens,\nand warned that Athens considered the issue of warning stickers\n\"a hostile act against our country.\"\n\n\n\"The Americans should first take a look at their own statistics\nof the terrorist actions taking place at their airports and then\nconcern themselves with the Athens airport, which is among the\nsafest in the world,\" Michalis Perros, head of Greece's Civil\nAviation Union was quoted as saying by local press reports today.\n\n\nIt was reported that a group of U.S. travel experts are due to\ncome to Athens to inspect the airport but the Greek Transport\nMinistry was considering whether they would permit the visit.\n\n\nGovernment spokesman Reppas said Prime Minister Simitis had\nrequested the lifting of the U.S. warning during a meeting with\nAmbassador Niles today and Niles promised that every effort would\nbe made to \"resolve the issue within 30 days.\"",

      "content": "SENATE PASSES BILL THAT INCLUDES MONEY FOR KANSAS CITY\nINTERNATIONAL \n\n\n\n   WASHINGTON _ A measure that passed the Senate on Wednesday calls\nfor $11.6 million in airport improvements at Kansas City\nInternational Airport and may open the way for more nonstop flights\nfrom KCI to Washington's Reagan National Airport.\n\n\n   The conference report releases federal funds to pay for most of\nthe cost of resurfacing concrete aprons around the terminals and\nupgrading security in doorways leading from the terminals to\nairplanes and to ground areas.\n\n\n   ``This is new money for us,'' said Russell Widmar, aviation\ndirector for the city of Kansas City, which runs KCI. ``We're\nexcited about it.''\n\n\n   The KCI projects are part of $40 billion in Federal Aviation\nAdministration spending nationwide in the next three years that the\nSenate and House have debated for months. It is expected to win\nHouse approval next week, said Steve Hilton, spokesman for Sen.\nJohn Ashcroft, a Missouri Republican.\n\n\n   Widmar said some of the federal money would pay for the final\nsegments of a seven-phase program to replace concrete aprons built\nin the early 1970s. And $4.6 million would pay for security,\nincluding conversion of secured doorways to card rather than key\nsystems.\n\n\n   The bill also has about $38 million for improvements at eight\nother Missouri airports, including $26.54 million for Lambert-St.\nLouis International Airport.\n\n\n   ``Missouri airports will be able to move ahead with ambitious\nmodernization programs,'' Ashcroft said.\n\n\n   Ashcroft was sponsor of an amendment to the bill that would open\n24 more slots at Reagan National Airport, which has tight capacity\nrestrictions. Half of those slots would be for flights from cities\nbeyond the current limit of 1,250 miles.\n\n\n   The other 12 slots would be available for flights from cities\nsuch as Kansas City that are within 1,250 miles. Two carriers _\nMidwest Express and Vanguard Airlines _ have expressed interest in\nadding nonstop service to Reagan National. Only USAir now offers\nsuch service.\n\n\n   ``Those will be very hard slots to get,'' Widmar said. ``They\nwill be competitive among all the cities.''\n\n\n   A spokeswoman for Vanguard Airlines in Kansas City said it was\ntoo early to say whether the airline would propose serving Reagan\nNational. Gate availability and landing fees at KCI will be among\nfactors in the decision, she said.\n\n\n   A public affairs official of Midwest Express did not return a\ncall for comment on Wednesday, but Widmar said he had heard that\nthe Milwaukee-based airline would also be interested in serving\nReagan National.",

Miller said it's important to note that most crimes at the\ngarage have been crimes of property, like car prowls, and not rapes\nor assaults.\n\n\n   And that leaves little reason for boosting garage staffing, said\nAviation director Gina Marie Lindsey.\n\n\n   ``History doesn't seem to warrant throwing a lot of folks and\ntechnology at the garage,'' Lindsey said.\n\n\n   A woman shot two years ago in the huge Sea-Tac garage is suing\nthe port for negligence, but port officials say no security\nmeasures could prevent that kind of sudden attack.\n\n\n   But interviews with police at other airports around the country\nshow that they devote special resources to keeping their garages as\nsafe as possible.\n\n\n   Police at Washington's Dulles aim cameras to cover every blind\nspot at the lot. At Boston's Logan, troopers sometimes stake out\nBMWs and other fancy cars on the chance thieves will target them.\n\n\n   San Francisco's lots are watched by private security guards on\nevery floor, while L.A. officers sometimes use military\nnight-vision goggles to watch the sprawling airport lots.\n\n\n   ``We're kind of proud of what we've been able to do,'' said L.A.\nairport police Capt. John Bangs. ``Every garage gets patrolled at\nleast a couple of times every shift.''\n\n\n   Documents filed with the lawsuit indicate that the Sea-Tac\ngarage is not routinely patrolled, though officers from other beats\nsometimes make checks there.\n\n\n   Officials at other airports _ as well as nationally recognized\nexperts on parking _ say garages require special vigilence. They're\nwhere people leave one of their most valuable and treasure-filled\npossessions, and any theft that's interrupted has the potential to\nturn violent.\n\n\n   ``Security should be at the top of the mind of anyone who's\noffering parking to the public,'' said Brad Parrish, president of\nV.P. Services, a consulting firm for parking operators.\n\n\n   Another Seattle parking consultant, Greg Jacobson, said visible\nsecurity is simply good business, making people more more likely to\nreturn.\n\n\n   ``My feeling,'' he said, ``is spend the money.''\n\n\n   Many garage planners at malls and other facilities follow that\nadvice.\n\n\n   Below downtown Seattle, the 1,200-stall Pacific Place garage is\nliterally as bright as day thanks to white metal-halide bulbs\ncranking out an average of 7.5 foot candles of illumination.\n\n\n   That's about 14 times the brightness given off by the amber\nlamps at the Sea-Tac garage, where Jacobson said the lighting level\nis about one-half a foot candle _ roughly the visibility of the\ndesert in a full moon.\n\n\n   ``What was really key for us,'' said Pacific Place spokeswoman\nJane Lewis, ``is that from the drawing board on up, the security\nand comfort of the user were important.''\n\n\n   Pacific Place designers also enhanced security by painting the\nwalls a reflective white and by removing s",

He\nnoted that since the bombing of two American embassies in Africa in\nAugust, as well as the detention of suspects here, security in\ngeneral has been heightened, and he called the latest response a\n``slight'' increase that many people might not notice.\n\n\n   ``We had increased security throughout the city at significant\nplaces,'' the mayor said, ``so the increase that's taken place now\nshouldn't be felt by people. It's fairly subtle, but people should\nunderstand we were already at a fairly high level of security.''\n\n\n   Like the mayor, police officials declined to divulge details for\nfear of compromising the measures. But they acknowledged that\nhundreds of extra officers were being deployed at the United\nNations headquarters; at the World Trade Center, which was hit by a\nterrorist bomb in 1993; and at government buildings and\ntransportation centers across the region.\n\n\n   Heightened security procedures were evident at major\ntransportation centers. At Kennedy, La Guardia and Newark\nInternational Airports, curb-side check-ins were canceled so that\nbaggage would not be left unattended. Similarly, vehicles standing\neven briefly unattended near passenger terminals were being towed\naway, officials said. And bomb-sniffing dogs were being used where\nsuspicions were raised.\n\n\n   At the Lincoln and Holland Tunnels, at the George Washington and\nTriboro Bridges, and at the other bridges and tunnels linking New\nYork, New Jersey, Long Island and the regional suburbs, extra\nofficers were on watch, and scores of vehicles, especially trucks\nand vans, were being pulled over at random and checked, Port\nAuthority officials said.\n\n\n   Bus and train terminals in New York and New Jersey also were\nbeing watched by additional officers.\n\n\n   Even some regular government employees known to security\nofficers were not allowed to pass freely. One official employed at\n26 Federal Plaza, for example, said that officers of the Federal\nProtective Service were opening and examining car trunks at random\nat the garage entrance, even when they knew the driver, to guard\nagainst any bomb planted surreptitiously.\n\n\n   ``In general,'' one official said, ``in order to get into any\ngovernment building in New York, you have to show identification\nand explain your reason for being there.''",

      "content": "AIRPORTS LOOKING MORE AND MORE LIKE SHOPPING MALLS \n\n\n\n   It is not easy to squeeze into a dressing room with two pieces\nof carry-on luggage and a laptop to try on a pair of jeans. And the\nsight of three airline captains hovering over a table of pink\nlingerie at Victoria's Secret still draws a second glance.\n\n\n   But such scenes are quietly becoming as integral to air travel\nas jet lag, weather delays and nondairy creamer. A number of\nairports, somewhat surreal spaces where travelers were once content\nto buy a few magazines and stare nervously at a clock, are starting\nto look a lot like malls.\n\n\n   In the last few years, dozens of national retailers have opened\nairport shops, invading what has long been the domain of\nnewsstands, duty-free shops and the occasional live lobster stand\nby establishing small outposts of the Gap, Victoria's Secret and\nthe like. At least one store, Altitunes, operates only in airports.\nSuch stores are joined by a full array of food chains, including\nStarbucks and Legal Sea Foods.\n\n\n   The strategy makes some sense. Many retailers have saturated the\nnation's malls and downtowns, and are desperate for new places to\nset up shop. And with both business and leisure travel at a\ndecade-long high, a lot of airports are scurrying to freshen up\ntheir terminals.\n\n\n   Running a business in an airport, though, can be a logistical\nnightmare. In no mall in America, for instance, are food merchants\nforced to take a dozen heads of lettuce through security. Many\nworkers balk at commuting to an airport. And customers often breeze\nby shops in rushing to the gate.\n\n\n   But for all the headaches, airport stores can be profitable:\nSales per square foot are often three or four times as high as\nthose for stores in other locations, even though prices are the\nsame as at malls. And ubiquitous delays coupled with the increased\nsecurity measures that force travelers to get to airports earlier\nthese days means these shoppers-in-motion often have more spare\ntime on their hands. Managers at Ronald Reagan Washington National\nAirport say annual sales average $950 a square foot, more than\nthree times the business in an average mall store, where the figure\ntends to be closer to $250 to $300.\n\n\n   Airports from Heathrow, outside London, to Pittsburgh\nInternational to La Guardia in New York to National have undergone\nmajor renovations in recent years in which the addition of new\nstores has played a key role. Others, like Chicago's O'Hare, are\nfollowing suit.\n\n\n   While most American retailers have mall life down to a science,\nthough, they are finding that running a shop in an airport is\nanother story entirely.\n\n\n   For one thing, airport rents are at least 20 percent higher,\nusually paid out as a percentage of sales. And shoppers are likely\nto spend only moments browsing.\n\n\n   ``Airport retail is a tough business operationally,'' said\nJudith Byrd, a principal with Unison Consulting Group, an airport\nconsultant in Chicago. ``The hours are longer, the rents are\nhigher. And you have to have an understanding of the market and\nairline passenger flows.''\n\n\n   Many retailing problems are unique to airports, like how to get\nmerchandise through customs and security and onto a selling floor\nthat is at most half the size of a company's average store.\n\n\n   But others are similar to what every retailer faces, with some\ntwists. Location is usually the most important factor in a\nretailer's success, but with airport shops, location has as much to\ndo with which airline a shop is parked next to as with what city\nthe airport is in and which department store is nearby.\n\n\n   People who study airport retailing say the best-performing\nstrips are in hub airports, where lots of passengers are changing\nplanes and are thus forced to linger. Heavy international traffic\nis a big plus. And it is always better to have the shops located\nafter the security point.\n\n\n   ``Everybody is in a rush to get to the airport,'' said Michael\nBell, president of BAA PLC's American unit, which manages the shops\nat Pittsburgh airport, one of the first American airports to entic",

They declined to comment further Thursday. \n\n\n\tPeople familiar with the investigation said the teen's journey  \nas a stowaway began when he scaled a 10- to 12-foot fence, cut the \nbarbed wire at the top and dropped onto the tarmac area north of \nthe main terminals. \n\n\n\tThey said Derman walked about a quarter-mile to the  \ninternational terminal, where he climbed a metal staircase leading \nto a jetway, the tunnel joining the terminal with the waiting \naircraft. \n\n\n\tA jetway door, which is the airline's responsibility, is  \nsupposed to be locked. But the teen-ager apparently found it \nunlocked or open, and quickly boarded a Boeing 747 preparing for a \ntrip to London. \n\n\n\tOnce on board Flight 214, Derman allegedly took a seat in the  \ncoach section, but had to move when the rightful ticket-holder \narrived. He allegedly found an empty seat in the business section \nand settled in for the flight. \n\n\n\tAfter landing at Heathrow Airport, the boy was confronted by  \nofficials after gaining access to a restricted area, according to \nthe officials familiar with the case. \n\n\n\tThe next day, British Airways flew Derman back to Boston in  \ncoach class. He was detained and questioned -- though not arrested -- \nby state police. He told investigators he had thought the stunt \nwould impress Israel's Mossad intelligence agency. \n\n\n\tDerman, accompanied by his father, also gave investigators a  \nstep-by-step account of how he penetrated security, including in a \nwalking tour in which he traced his route to the plane. \n\n\n\tThe Boston Globe reported Derman is 17, but that could not be  \nverified. Calls made to a Brookline residence listed under the name \nDerman were not returned. \n\n\n\tPart of the FAA investigation is likely to focus on the security  \nmeasures taken by the airline. Airlines usually hand-count \npassengers and compare the number with the tickets collected at the \ngate.",

      "content": "AIRPORT SECURITY TO BE TIGHTENED \n\n\n\n   SEATTLE _ Sea-Tac Airport managers promised Tuesday to add\npolice patrols, improve lighting, upgrade emergency call boxes and\ntake other steps to heighten security in the huge parking garage.\n\n\n   The measures come after a Post-Intelligencer series on security\ngaps in the garage, and the port's payment of $2.6 million to\nsettle a shooting victim's lawsuit.\n\n\n   ``There's been some fear recently, and we want to have that\nalleviated,'' Gina Marie Lindsey, aviation director, told Port of\nSeattle commissioners Tuesday.\n\n\n   The P-I reported in March that unlike the lots at most other\nmajor airports surveyed, the Sea-Tac garage had infrequent police\npatrols, no emergency panic buttons and lighting that fell far\nshort of current industry standards.\n\n\n   Measures unveiled Tuesday would correct some of those\nconditions, but Lindsey said the 10,000-stall garage already was\nrelatively safe.\n\n\n   The upgrades, she said, are intended not only to make travelers\nfeel more secure, but to smooth their way through an increasingly\ncrowded facility.\n\n\n   Still, she said public fear generated by the P-I series had\nhelped initiate or speed up several changes:\n\n\n   (BBOX)Stepping up patrols so there is one police officer\nsomewhere in the eight-story garage at least half of each day.\n\n\n   Previously, the garage was not patrolled at all many days,\nexcept on a spot basis.\n\n\n   (BBOX)Circulating electric carts topped by flashing lights\ncarrying customer-service agents. They will be able to direct lost\nmotorists and lend a uniformed presence in the garage.\n\n\n   (BBOX)Offering Block Watch-style training in coming weeks to\nairport and airline workers to help them spot security problems and\nknow how to respond.\n\n\n   (BBOX)Modifying emergency telephones in the next three weeks to\ntransmit to dispatchers the caller's exact location.\n\n\n   (BBOX)Replacing the lamps in older sections of the garage and\nredesigning the garage's lighting to eliminate severe contrast\nbetween dark and light areas.\n\n\n   Only the lighting project was given a specific pricetag: $4.5\nmillion, an allocation that will require approval by the port\ncommission in about two months.\n\n\n   Studies on how to improve the lighting had long been under way,\nLindsey said, but the project probably would not have been launched\nfor another year without the recent publicity.\n\n\n   The added police patrols in the garage began about four weeks\nago, she said. The other safety measures will be launched as soon\nas possible.\n\n\n   In addition, she said, port officials also are studying\nlonger-term security changes such as installing a network of\nsecurity cameras.\n\n\n   The only cameras now in the garage are used to check maintenance\nconditions around the elevators. In the coming weeks, Lindsey said,\nthe facilities personnel who monitor those cameras will be trained\nto spot and report security problems, as well.\n\n\n   Lindsey presented the security improvements as part of a larger\npackage of ``customer-service'' upgrades.\n\n\n   The eight-story airport garage _ which Sea-Tac officials believe\nto be the largest single parking structure in the nation _ is\nbulging at the seams. It handled four million cars last year, which\ncarried many of the 25.8 million people who flew through Sea-Tac.\nLast year, the structure generated a $34 million profit.\n\n\n   The garage regularly fills up twice a week _ typically midday\nWednesdays and Thursdays _ and the congestion is only getting\nworse.\n\n\n   A hotline (206-433-5308) alerts motorists to sold-out\nsituations, alternative parking locales, and other conditions. The\nairport's website (www.portseattle.org/seatac) will be upgraded by\nlate May to do the same.\n\n\n   Airport officials also promise to have in place by October a\nspeedy pay-on-the-way-to-your-car exit system, and to add 3,000 new\nparking stalls by July 2000.\n\n\n   As to security, port Police Chief Patrick Kasnick said the\nairport garage is as safe as the surrounding community.\n\n\n   Not counting crimes involving its rental cars, he said Sea-Tac's\ngarage has one-fourth as much crime",

The measures were begun shortly after the bombing, but\nratcheted up quickly with the news that the suspects would be\nfacing trial here.\n\n\n   What began with identification checks and barriers of red-velvet\nropes stretching out of the entrances to important city buildings,\nlike the Police Headquarters at 1 Police Plaza, quickly took on the\nappearance of large-scale construction.\n\n\n   Traffic has been backed up or rerouted on several streets in\nlower Manhattan over the last three days, as trucks brought in huge\nconcrete barriers to be erected around police headquarters, federal\nbuildings and City Hall. Parts of Pearl Street, which leads to the\nfederal court and the Metropolitan Correction Center, have been\nclosed from Madison Street to Park Row, with police officers posted\non the perimeter.\n\n\n   Garbage bins in the area have been locked shut, while\nbomb-sniffing dogs have sometimes been seen walking the street near\nthe detention center, which holds Mohamed Rashed Daoud 'Owhali and\nMohammed Saddiq Odeh, the two suspects in the Nairobi bombing that\nkilled at least 247 people, including 12 Americans.\n\n\n   Barriers were also being installed at the Metro-Tech Center in\nBrooklyn, which houses the Fire Department headquarters and the\ncity's 911 emergency system, said a fire official who spoke on\ncondition of anonymity. He added that a wooden barrier erected to\nstop cars from entering a parking garage in the center had been\nreplaced days ago with a sheet of steel mesh that has to be raised\nbefore cars are allowed inside and that guards were checking\ncredentials.\n\n\n   Marilyn Mode, a Police Department spokeswoman, said that other\nprecautions, including more street closings, may be taken. But she\nadded that the barricades and other security measures were not\nbeing taken because of any known terrorism threat.\n\n\n   Bill Dempsey, a spokesman for the U.S. Marshals Service, said\nthat his people ``have been on alert status with all the activity\ngoing on in New York, and we are taking any and all necessary\nprecautions to assure the security of the judiciary.''\n\n\n   Some of the latest precautions are at the city's airports and\nsporting events. One Port Authority police officer at Kennedy\nAirport, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that the number\nof officers patrolling the city's airports had been increased to\nlevels comparable to those in the Persian Gulf war, with about\none-third more officers being assigned to watch for suspicious\nactivity and answer calls about unattended packages.\n\n\n   ``We're getting a lot more calls right now, to unattended bags\nand cars,'' he said. ``There's a lot more private security both\ninside and outside the terminals, and instead of a left bag being\nroutine, people are now calling them in. They don't want to take\nchances anymore.''",

This is\nnot a reaction to things that happened out west.''\n\n\n   The Georgia State Patrol and local law enforcement agencies also\nwill beef up staffing shortly after Christmas, but that also was\nplanned as a response to Y2K.\n\n\n   Bob Finke, a senior security consultant with IPSA International,\nInc. in Atlanta, said Americans should be particularly vigilant\nthis holiday season because of the recent arrest in Washington and\nrepeated threats against the United States by terrorist leader\nOsama bin Laden.\n\n\n   Americans tend to let down their guard during the holidays and\nmight be more inclined to do so as 1999 becomes 2000, he said.\n\n\n   ``The unfortunate part about our country is we have a\ntarget-rich environment and we can't protect it all. Terrorists say\nlaw enforcement and security experts have to be lucky all the time.\nTerrorists only have to be lucky once,'' Finke said.\n\n\n   Celestine Armstead, spokeswoman for the Atlanta office of the\nFBI, would not say if additional agents are being called to duty\nbecause of the increased threat from terrorism or Y2K. ``We're\ngoing to be adequately staffed to address the situation,'' Armstead\nsaid.\n\n\n   Lt. Col. Ken Baldowski, spokesman for the Georgia National\nGuard, said no special precautions are being made beyond what is in\nplace for Y2K and problems it may cause.\n\n\n   He also pointed out that a 22-member unit that specializes in\nassisting after terrorist attacks involving weapons of mass\ndestruction is now in place at Dobbins Air Reserve Base. Known as\nthe 4th Military Support Detachment, the unit would be called in to\nidentify what explosives or toxic agents were used and then request\nassistance from the appropriate federal and state agencies.\n\n\n   Baldowski said the unit will not be on any higher state of alert\nover the holidays. ``No more than they normally are. Their people\ncan be gathered very, very quickly,'' he said.\n\n\n   Story Filed By Cox Newspapers\n\n\n   For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service",

Once the larger airports \nare checked, officials will then look at smaller commercial \nairports, he said. \n\n\n\tThe FAA's security crackdown follows tests by federal agents at  \nfive major airports. Testifying before the House Appropriations \nCommittee's panel on transportation and related agencies, the \nauditors reported Wednesday they were able to bypass secured areas \nand even board the planes. \n\n\n\t``In a high percentage of tests involving airport access  \ncontrols, our successful penetration of secure areas almost always \nresulted in our boarding an aircraft,'' said Alexis Stefani, the \nTransportation Department's deputy assistant inspector general for \naviation. \n\n\n\tStefani told lawmakers many of the problems found in a similar  \naudit in 1993 still exist. For example, he said, undercover \npersonnel could enter through emergency exits and penetrate air \ncargo facilities by following airport personnel through access \ncontrol points. \n\n\n\tThe majority of individuals encountered by the agents failed to  \nchallenge them for unauthorized access and in some cases, airport \nlaw enforcement officials failed to respond to emergency door \nalarms. At two airports, undercover auditors bypassed passenger \nscreening checkpoints and entered the concourse. \n\n\n\tStefani attributed the ``human element'' as the primary weakness  \nin keeping unauthorized personnel out of secured areas. \n\n\n\tThe FAA's inspection and testing of airport security also needs  \nstrengthening, Stefani said. \n\n\n\tThe agency sets guidelines and establishes procedures for  \nsecurity, while airports are responsible for controlling access to \nsecured areas within the facility. Airlines oversee passengers and \ncargo. Airports and airlines together have historically been \nresponsible for maintaining security equipment and systems. \n\n\n\tIn a letter sent to airports, Retired Adm. Cathal Flynn, the  \nFAA's associate administrator for civil aviation security, said \nunauthorized personnel sneaking past controlled access is a serious \nsecurity problem. \n\n\n\t``Allowing intruders to piggy-back through access doors, not  \nchallenging intruders on the ramp, and intruders being able to get \naboard aircraft combine to make a significant vulnerability,'' \nFlynn wrote. \n\n\n\tHe suggested that ``redundant measures, such as guarding the  \nindividual aircraft,'' could be required if the problems persist. \n\n\n\tThe Dallas Morning News reported in its Wednesday editions that  \nfederal agents were able to get through security doors 46 times at \nfour major airports, walk around on the tarmac and board 51 \nairplanes unchallenged.",

      "content": "U.S. RECONSIDERS AIRPORT SECURITY PLAN CALLED DISCRIMINATORY \n\n\n\n   WASHINGTON _ The Transportation Department is rethinking a plan\nto test whether an airport security measure discriminates against\nmembers of minority groups after the Arab American Institute\ncomplained that the test was worse than the problem it was supposed\nto detect.\n\n\n   The institute objected to the department's plan to ask\npassengers about their religion and ethnic background to help\ndetermine whether they were being unfairly singled out by security\nofficers. The institute complained that asking the questions would\ncontribute to the perception that Arabs were unfairly viewed as\nsuspects.\n\n\n   The security measure, adopted by the Federal Aviation\nAdministration in late 1997, is called the Computer-Assisted\nPassenger Prescreening System. Using secret criteria, it identifies\npassengers about whom enough is known so that they are not\nsubjected to extra security measures, including searches of checked\nbaggage or more careful scanning of carry-ons.\n\n\n   Before the system was introduced, Arab Americans and others\ncomplained that it might unfairly single out people because of\ntheir race, ethnic background or religious beliefs. The FAA said\nthat for security reasons it would not say what the selection\ncriteria were. But the agency said the criteria did not include\nrace or religion, and the Justice Department, after conducting a\nreview, agreed.\n\n\n   In December 1999, however, the Transportation Department, the\nFAA's parent agency, said it would test the prescreening system for\nwhat it called ``disparate impact'' _ meaning that certain ethic\ngroups received disparate treatment. To do that, the department\nsaid it would survey planeloads of people at six or seven airports,\nstarting with Detroit, beginning as early as April, and focusing on\nflights to Europe that connected with flights to the Middle East.\n\n\n   The idea was to determine the ethnicity and religion of everyone\non the flight, to get from the airlines data on who had been\nsubjected to extra screening and then to determine ``whether the\nselection criteria in fact have a disparate impact,'' according to\na plan the Transportation Department sent the Arab group.\n\n\n   The department drafted a form asking passengers for their name,\nsex, race, ``ethnicity/national origin,'' religion and citizenship.\nIt asked the Arab group for help in winning the cooperation of Arab\nand Arab American passengers.\n\n\n   But James Zogby, president of the Arab American Institute, said\nhe had asked the department to drop the survey idea.\n\n\n   ``Everybody knows we're already viewed as suspect,'' Zogby said.\n``If you live in a country where you feel you are judged guilty\nbecause of ethnicity or religion, and then you ask about ethnicity\nand religion, you're asking for a form of self-incrimination.''\n\n\n   ``Their intention is good,'' he added, ``but there has to be a\nless intrusive way to do this.''\n\n\n   Bill Adams, a spokesman for the Transportation Department, said\nthe department was listening to the complaints, but was determined\nto carry out some kind of test.\n\n\n   ``Our interest is security,'' Adams said, adding: ``We won't\ntolerate discrimination.''\n\n\n   Because of the complaints, he said the department was not\ncertain it would proceed with the survey as originally planned.\n\n\n   Zogby said the computerized system had turned out to be less\noffensive than the system that preceded it, which was a secret set\nof criteria applied by airline personnel. Women with veils or head\ncoverings and men with beards who appeared Arab were much more\nlikely to be subjected to extra security measures when the judgment\nwas made by a person than when it was made by a computer, he said.\n\n\n   Although the list of criteria is secret, FAA officials have said\nit includes factors like a passenger's travel history, which\nexperts say could, in fact, bring more scrutiny to people who\ntravel regularly to Middle Eastern countries.",

      "content": "NEW YORK _ After TWA Flight 800 exploded off Long Island in July\n1996, initial fears that the jumbo jet had been brought down by a\nterrorist bomb prompted the Clinton administration and Congress to\ndemand that security at the nation's airports be improved.\n\n\n   Legislation was adopted. A down payment of $400 million was\nappropriated for bomb detection machines. The Federal Aviation\nAdministration was given several months to produce a report on how\nto redesign the country's air travel security system. A commission\nheaded by Vice President Al Gore urged airlines to pay their\nsecurity personnel better wages to upgrade the quality of\nperformance.\n\n\n   But more than three years later, as investigators are again\nasking whether a plane fell from the sky because of a mechanical\nfailure or an act of sabotage, critics of the FAA and the airline\nindustry, within and outside of government, say the safety\nimprovements achieved at airports across the country have been\nmodest at best.\n\n\n   The FAA, for example, took two years, not three months, to\nproduce its report on how the industry and its regulators could\nbetter ensure security; the $1 million state-of-the-art detection\ndevices used to examine baggage at 80 airports are being badly\nunderused, according to a 1999 government audit; that same audit\nalso found that efforts to limit access to airplanes on the ground\nby unauthorized people was no better than it had been three years\nago.\n\n\n   ``When you talk about progress since 1996, I don't think much\nhas been done,'' said a former member of the Gore Commission who\nworked for months on pushing reforms and who spoke on the condition\nof anonymity.\n\n\n   Of course officials now believe that TWA Flight 800 was not\nbrought down by a bomb, and there is no evidence that EgyptAir 990,\nthe Boeing 767 that tumbled out of the sky last Sunday morning\nshortly after taking off from Kennedy International Airport, was\nthe victim of sabotage.\n\n\n   But there is no evidence, either, that a mechanical failure\ncaused the EgyptAir crash. And so as the search for an answer goes\non, investigators are interviewing security personnel at JFK and at\nLos Angeles International Airport, the 767's initial takeoff site,\nexamining passenger lists and, in their own urgent way, taking\nstock of whether things at the airports are any better than they\nwere in 1996.\n\n\n   For their part, the FAA and airline officials point out that no\nairplane departing from the United States has ever been destroyed\nby a bomb. And they add that they have, in fact, made progress in\nimproving security _ though some delays were unavoidable _ and that\nthey are using the high-tech baggage checkers as frequently as is\npractically possible.\n\n\n   And there are legislators who support the claims of progress.\n\n\n   Rep. James Oberstar of Minnesota, who is the ranking Democrat on\nthe House Transportation Committee, said the FAA was doing ``a very\ngood job.''\n\n\n   But the evidence shows that the problems the agency has faced in\nbeefing up security are similar to those that have plagued it\nbefore, most famously in its long-delayed efforts to modernize the\nnation's air traffic control system. The agency, according to its\ncritics and even some of its supporters, is often immobilized by\nits attempts to seek consensus among the various public and private\ninterests it is supposed to be regulating.\n\n\n   One priority established after the crash of TWA Flight 800 was\nthe greater use of high-technology explosive-detection devices. In\nthe fall of 1996, Congress appropriated $144 million for the FAA to\nbuy the machines.\n\n\n   To date, 136 of a total of 400 explosive-detection devices, each\ncosting about $1 million, have been deployed at 80 airports. In\naddition, about 600 machines that are used to detect traces of\nexplosives in carry-on luggage are also in use.\n\n\n   But an audit by the Department of Transportation's inspector\ngeneral published earlier this year found that the machines were\nvastly underused by airlines, which are responsible for screening\nbaggage. The report _ which assessed a variety of security",

Through his questioning of the female\nairline employee, he learned that he fit a profile set by the\nFederal Aviation Administration, he said.\n\n\n   ``She basically told us we paid in cash, we looked suspicious,\nand we were African-American,'' said Gray, 39.\n\n\n   Southwest Airline officials could not be reached for comment\nSaturday at their corporate office in Dallas.

How is it that mankind is\nbrilliant enough to build machines that fly so high and so fast,\nyet we can't supply sufficient parking on the ground?\n\n\n   And because of this absurdity, how many of us would miss our\ntight flight connections?\n\n\n   Then my gaze focused on the beehive of activity below, on scores\nof carts and trucks scooting across the pavement and carrying\nliterally thousands of pieces of luggage.\n\n\n   For a scant moment, my dismay intensified. My bags probably\nwouldn't make the connection, either, I convinced myself. And by\nthe way: Are these the same guys who knocked a wheel off my new\nsuitcase the last time I traveled through Hartsfield International?\n\n\n   But as time passed, I ceased bemoaning our temporary fate and\ninstead began marveling at the men and women driving these baggage\nvehicles, working frantically to ensure that the possessions of\ntens of thousands of passengers each day reach their appointed\ndestinations.\n\n\n   The wonder isn't that an occasional bag is misdirected or\ndamaged; it's that these occurrences are so infrequent, especially\ngiven the pace and scope of modern-day travel.\n\n\n   &QL; \nSILENT HELPERS &QL;\n\n\n   Amid all the hassles, it's easy to become frustrated.

We deservedly reward tour guides. But the\ndriver who gets us safely to each destination too often goes\nunthanked.\n\n\n   Busboys on cruise ships and in restaurants. At sea, the busboy\ngets half the gratuity traditionally offered a waiter and often\nworks twice as hard. At least we usually know his name; in\nrestaurants on land we're rarely introduced.\n\n\n   Housekeepers in hotels. We trust them with our valued\npossessions as we go sightseeing or attend business meetings, and\nalmost without exception they never let us down. But how often do\nwe ask their name? Or leave a thank-you tip?\n\n\n   Individuals in airports and at other public venues who transport\ntravelers with disabilities and elderly or injured travelers on\ncarts and in wheelchairs. Some are airport or airline personnel;\nothers are volunteers.

      "content": "AIRLINE SUES TO RID AIRPORT OF BAGGAGE SCREENING DEVICE  \n\n\n\n   Continental Airlines filed a federal antitrust lawsuit Monday\nagainst United Airlines and the committee that oversees operations\nat Washington Dulles International Airport, contending that\nrecently installed baggage-sizing templates inhibit competition.\n\n\n   The suit, which was filed against United and the Dulles Airport\nAirline Management Council in federal court in Virginia, comes\nafter the installation on April 15 of the templates at X-ray\nsecurity checkpoints at Dulles.\n\n\n   United, which is the largest airline at Dulles, carrying more\nthan 40 percent of the airport's passengers in the year ended Feb.\n29, had proposed installing the templates. The carrier uses the\nequipment to screen bags at 24 other U.S. airports.\n\n\n   Continental, which says it has more overhead bin space on its\nplanes and uses that as a marketing tool to attract customers,\nopposed the templates, contending they would prevent its passengers\nfrom carrying their bags onto its aircraft.\n\n\n   The ability to carry on _ rather than check _ bags has been\nhotly contested in the U.S. airline industry in recent years.\nAirlines like United, American and Delta have installed sizing\nequipment at airports to prevent travelers from carrying excessive\namounts of baggage into aircraft cabins. Many business travelers,\nin addition to Continental, oppose these measures.\n\n\n   The Dulles suit is the third time Continental has fought\ninstallation of baggage-screening devices at airports. In late\n1998, the airline, which is the nation's fifth largest, sued Delta,\nthe No. 3 airline, in California, contending that Delta's templates\nat San Diego International Airport interfered with its carry-on\npolicies. That case was settled out of court. Soon afterward,\nContinental also threatened to sue United, the largest U.S.\nairline, over United's use of templates at Denver International\nAirport. The airlines settled the matter without legal action.\n\n\n   In the Washington suit, Continental contends that United\n``conspired with other airlines under the auspices of the Airline\nManagement Council to limit competition by requiring all airlines'\ncustomers to conform to a single, restrictive standard for carry-on\nbaggage.''\n\n\n   Continental contends that the actions of United and the council\nviolate antitrust law and interfere with Continental's contractual\nrelationships with its customers. It also says that United ``led\nthe conspiracy among airlines who voted in favor of installing\nsizers at Dulles, preventing Continental and other carriers from\ncompeting for customers by offering more customer-friendly carry-on\npolicies.'' Continental and its regional partner, Continental\nExpress, are seeking removal of the templates and triple damages.\n\n\n   Kieran Sheridan, chairman of the Dulles Airport Airline\nManagement Council and Northwest's general manager at the airport,\nsaid the decision to use the templates, which block large items\nfrom entering X-ray machines at checkpoints, was made only after\ninstallation was approved by the majority of members of the\ncouncil, as is required by its bylaws. Six carriers voted against\ninstallation, he said: Continental, Continental Express, Northwest,\nUS Airways, Midwest Express and Virgin Atlantic.\n\n\n   Sheridan said that he had received no complaints about the\ntemplates after some initial flaws were straightened out, and that\nhe was ``curious about Continental's allegations about back-door\ndeals being made.''\n\n\n   ``To my understanding, Continental was present at all meetings,\nand nothing was not discussed in an open forum,'' he added.\n\n\n   United declined to comment on Continental's lawsuit. Most of the\nother carriers that voted against the templates said they had no\nplans to take legal action.\n\n\n   From a legal perspective, some experts said that Continental\nmight have a valid claim.\n\n\n   Michael Levine, a Harvard Law School professor, former official\nof the Civil Aeronautics Board and a former executive at\nContinental and Northwest, said that ``in the basic thrust of\nContinental's argument,",

A New York City police officer who\nusually patrols several blocks near the Port Authority Bus Terminal\nwas sticking close to the bus station, and two police officers had\nbeen sent to the U.N. building to stand guard on the sidewalk.\n\n\n   The officers said they were on the lookout for suspicious\npackages or cars left on the street with their engines running. But\nthey themselves were not arousing any curiosity. ``Nobody's asked\nany questions _ except directions,'' said one officer, who spoke on\nthe condition of anonymity.\n\n\n   On Thursday, officials of the Federal Aviation Administration\nand the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said they were\nalso taking precautions because of the possible threat of\nterrorism. But passengers at Kennedy International Airport and\nNewark International Airport said they were puzzled by the absence\nof a more visible show of security.\n\n\n   ``I expected all these strict rules when I got here today,''\nsaid Kate Doble, who was boarding a flight at Kennedy to return\nhome to Sydney, Australia, after working as a summer-camp counselor\nin North Carolina. ``I expected to be checked or have someone go\nthrough my bags, but they just passed me by.''\n\n\n   Laurent Mercier, a French government worker who was traveling to\nLos Angeles, said he was surprised that no one stopped him from\nleaving unattended luggage on a seat near the United Airlines\nticket counter in Newark, N.J. ``I left my bag on the seat and went\nto smoke a cigarette, and nobody said anything,'' he said.\n\n\n   Mercier said that because of the military strike, he had arrived\nat the airport two hours and 15 minutes before his scheduled 6:30\np.m. departure. ``If there had not been a strike, I would have gone\nto the Port Authority and caught a bus at about 4:15 to get here at\n5:15,'' he said.\n\n\n   Earlier in the day, passengers arriving at Kennedy after an\nAeroflot flight from St. Petersburg, Russia, said they noticed\nsomething a little out of the ordinary when they picked up their\nluggage at the Delta Air Lines baggage-claim area: a beagle was\nsniffing the bags. ``I've never seen that before,'' said Harry\nWilson, a political science professor from Roanoke, Va. ``But\ncoming through customs was easy. Customs was the same as always.''\n\n\n   At the U.N. building, three security officers stood behind the\nentry gate asking visitors with large packages to check them, a\nnormal routine. One of them, Hugh Mullaney, said that he had not\ndetected any heightened anxiety about the prospect of terrorism,\nperhaps because memories of the 1993 bombing of the World Trade\nCenter are no longer fresh.\n\n\n   ``It will have to start happening closer to home before people\nget nervous,'' Mullaney said.\n\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n\n   Some tourists visiting the United Nations brushed off the talk\nof danger. ``We're more scared in France than we are here,'' said\nValerie Nollet, a French real estate broker.\n\n\n   The terrorism alert was having little effect on travel plans,\ntravel agents across the city said. Most people who go abroad in\nlate August have nonrefundable tickets and are traveling for\npleasure, rather than business, and this is not the recommended\nseason for travel to either Africa or the Middle East.\n\n\n   Valerie Wilson, the owner of an agency that bears her name, said\nthat since the bombing of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania,\nabout two dozen clients had inquired whether it was safe to travel,\nbut only one had canceled plans to go on a safari in September.\n\n\n   ``People wanted to know if maybe there wasn't a stronger warning\nthat they hadn't heard over th",

International \nflights do not permit unattended passenger luggage to take off. \n\n\n\tMs. Schiavo's bag, which contained a tape recorder, a can of  \nshaving cream, a racquet ball can and some wiring, did not leave \nwith the flight bound for Washington. It was unclear if that was \ndue to airport security checks or because the television station, \nWCHM-TV, had informed the airport about the bag prior to takeoff. \n\n\n\tIn any event, the bag was taken to a screening area at some  \npoint and drew attention when X-ray screeners saw what it \ncontained. The airport concourse was evacuated, and the bag was \ntaken outside and investigated, shutting down a runway for four \nhours. \n\n\n\tAirport officials complained that the suspicious bag disrupted  \nthe airport. The FBI is investigating whether any laws were broken. \nThe FBI would not discuss its investigation, and the Federal \nAviation Administration would not comment on what possible laws may \nhave been broken. \n\n\n\tMs. Schiavo said she was sorry for any inconvenience ``but it  \nwas done by the airport with the full knowledge of what was going \non.'' \n\n\n\tThe television station said the airport was informed in advance  \nit would be doing a report on airport security Friday, but did not \ntell officials exactly how that was going to be done. \n\n\n\tMs. Schiavo resigned from her federal post in 1996 after  \ncriticizing the FAA on several occasions. Since then she has \npublished a book accusing the FAA of sloppy inspections, lax \nairport security and disregard for bogus airplane parts.",

But at others, including \nReagan National and Dulles International near Washington, no one \nchecks. \n\n\n\tAnyone can grab anything or, perhaps more worrisome for  \nsecurity, can leave a bag or package behind. The only safeguards \nare signs or public address warnings noting that many bags look \nalike so passengers should check their luggage tags. \n\n\n\tIn April 1998, police arrested a man who took advantage of such  \nlax security at Dallas-Fort Worth Airport. They said that James \nClarence Ringley of Arlington, Texas, stole about 500 bags from \nairline baggage belts and used the contents -- worth an estimated $1 \nmillion -- to stock a booth at a flea market. \n\n\n\tAirport police said it was the largest recovery of luggage at  \nany major U.S. airport. Ringley recently received four years in \nprison. \n\n\n\t``I've wondered about it a few times as I've walked out with all  \nkinds of bags and nobody's checked me,'' said J.T. Maiorano of New \nYork, a lighting technician who travels over 150,000 miles \nannually. \n\n\n\tStanding outside the USAirways claim area at Reagan National,  \nwhere he just picked up a garment bag unchallenged, Maiorano said, \n``I wouldn't mind at all being checked. ... I'd rather do it than \nget ripped off of my luggage.'' \n\n\n\tThe federal government requires the baggage questions at  \ncheck-in and the constant reminders about unattended luggage. \n\n\n\tBut security at the end of a trip -- in the baggage claim areas --  \nis the responsibility of individual airlines. They typically lease \nand operate baggage belts from an airport authority. Airlines, in \nturn, say they provide checkpoints where they are needed. \n\n\n\t``If we don't have a high incidence of problems, we don't do  \nit,'' said United Airlines spokesman Joe Hopkins. ``It helps keep \ndown the cost of air travel.'' \n\n\n\tSome airports like Hartsfield in Atlanta or Miami International  \nprovide baggage area security in many terminals as a basic service \nto their airline tenants. Atlanta, which handles 200,000 passengers \na day, spends about $1.5 million annually on it. \n\n\n\tAs a result, said Hartsfield spokeswoman Lanii Thomas, the  \nairport does not have a high rate of baggage theft. \n\n\n\tAirports generally don't keep track of stolen bags, deferring to  \nthe airlines. The carriers themselves are loath to report a bag as \nstolen, preferring to say that it is ``missing.'' Often a bag that \nhas been reported stolen ends up back at its intended destination \nafter a journey on the wrong flight. \n\n\n\tThe Transportation Department tracks mishandled bags -- those  \nthat are lost, damaged, delayed or ``pilfered.'' In March, the \nmajor U.S. airlines had about five reports of mishandled bags for \nevery 1,000 they handled, about the same as the year before. \n\n\n\tTightening security at baggage claim areas is not always  \nfoolproof. \n\n\n\tIn 1996, Los Angeles police arrested a man who allegedly raided  \nthe airline baggage belts at Los Angeles International and walked \naway with 11 sets of golf clubs, professional camera equipment, a \nsnowboard and other items worth an estimated $20,000. \n\n\n\tWhile the airport had and continues to use a bag-matching  \nprogram, the suspect found a way around it: He wore a Delta Air \nLines pilot uniform and a fake ID and strode confidently past the \ncheckout gates.",

Sometimes the screeners leave to work at\nairport fast-food outlets for higher pay and benefits, he said.\n\n\n   The FAA is working on new rules that would require security\ncompanies to be certified, Flynn said. It expects to make a final\ndecision on whether to implement the rule, which was suggested in\n1996 by the White House Commission on Aviation Safety Security, by\nMay 2001.\n\n\n   The administration will also use a new technology known as\nThreat Image Projection (TIP) to measure the performance of\nindividual screeners and screening companies.\n\n\n   TIP is a computer program that electronically inserts images of\ncontraband on X-ray and explosives detection system monitors,\nmaking it appear that the material is inside a bag being screened.\n\n\n   A computer-based training system to evaluate and train screeners\nis also under study, Stefani said.\n\n\n   The FAA hopes to install these devices and other equipment at\nairports nationwide by 2003, he said.\n\n\n   Even with better training and better pay, some members of the\naviation subcommittee said they feared screeners with criminal\nbackgrounds will be hired to handle passengers' luggage.\n\n\n   The FAA now performs criminal background checks on screeners,\nbut it doesn't disqualify candidates who have been arrested for\nsuch crimes as burglary, drug possession, arm robberies and assault\nwith a deadly weapon, Stefani said.\n\n\n   ``It's just extraordinary to me that we let the system operate\nin this way,'' said Rep. Peter A. DeFazio, D-Ore. ``Why have a weak\nlink in a sophisticated security system?''\n\n\n   Ismail Turay Jr.'s e-mail address is ismailt(at)coxnews.com\n\n\n   ENDIT\n\n\n   Story Filed By Cox Newspapers\n\n\n   For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service",

      "content": "MACHINES TO CHECK AIRLINE BAGS MOSTLY IDLE, REPORT SAYS \n\n\n\n   WASHINGTON _ The Federal Aviation Administration has spent more\nthan $122 million on machines to detect bombs in checked baggage,\nbut those machines that have been installed sit idle for most of\nthe day, according to investigators from the Department of\nTransportation.\n\n\n   The machines, which cost $1.3 million each to buy and install,\nare supposed to be capable of handling 225 bags an hour, but of 13\nthat were audited by investigators, nine handled fewer than 200\nbags a day, according to a report released on Friday.\n\n\n   Some got so little use that the operators could not maintain\nproficiency in running them, investigators said.\n\n\n   ``At some airports, they're sitting relatively unused,''\nLawrence Weintrob, an assistant inspector general of the\nTransportation Department, said in a telephone interview. ``Some\nairports that are using them are using them rarely, or process\nrelatively few bags through them.''\n\n\n   But Cathal Flynn, assistant administrator of the FAA for civil\naviation security, said the average number of bags processed\nthrough each machine was rising sharply as airlines gained\nexperience. Flynn and airline representatives said that part of the\nproblem was that the computerized system for choosing which\npassengers' bags get scanned was still developing, and would not be\nfully implemented until the end of the year.\n\n\n   ``We haven't ironed out all the kinks in the process,'' said\nSusan Rork, managing director of security at the Air Transport\nAssociation, the trade group of the major airlines.\n\n\n   The computerized system singles out individuals about whom there\nis too little information to conclude that they are not a threat,\nofficials say. It also draws a sample from the group judged not to\nbe a threat, to increase the chance that a terrorist would be\ncaught, and to make the system fairer, Flynn said.\n\n\n   One problem, he said, is that if the system were changed to\nrequire that a larger number of passengers have their bags\nscrutinized, then at peak periods people would be delayed so long\nthey would miss their flights.\n\n\n   ``If you get people fuming at a line, that's not good either,''\nFlynn said. That, he said, would probably discourage machine\noperators from doing their jobs right. And delays, he said, would\ndamage public acceptance of security measures.\n\n\n   In written comments responding to the report, the FAA said that\nthe agency would ``pursue a more coherent strategy with air\ncarriers to ramp-up to a higher level of use.'' However, the agency\nsaid, it would be ``many years'' before technology allowed\nscreening of all bags.\n\n\n   Auditors also said that the machines in use could handle only\nabout half as many bags as they did in lab tests, partly because\nthey sound false alarms far more when in use at airports. Each\nfalse alarm requires time to resolve. (All alarms so far have been\nfalse, officials said, because no bombs have been detected.)\n\n\n   The machines' higher false alarm rate is ``probably a reason why\nthey don't use it as often as they should,'' Weintrob said.\n\n\n   Fifty-nine of the machines have been installed so far; plans are\nto have 74 in place by the end of the year, he said.\n\n\n   Officials of airports where the machines are installed declined\nto comment and asked not to be identified. Under FAA rules, airport\noperators are responsible for various aspects of security, but not\nfor screening bags. That responsibility falls to the airlines.",

They're\nbecoming more aggressive. People lash out, scream at ticket agents.\nI'm concerned for my personal safety.''\n\n\n   Continental officials insisted Saturday that security for its\n49,300 employees across the nation was of paramount concern, and\nthat attacks by unruly passengers would not be tolerated. ``We will\nnot stand for any violence against our employees,'' said Catherine\nStengel, an airline spokeswoman. ``The safety of our employees is\nvery important to us.''\n\n\n   Ms. Stengel noted that Continental, like other airlines,\nprovided security at the airport, along with the Port Authority\npolice, but she acknowledged that the security was not specifically\nfocused on the protection of employees, and she declined to discuss\nthe adequacy of the security.\n\n\n   Gordon Bethune, chairman and chief executive of Continental, the\nnation's fifth largest airline, noted in a message to employees on\nFriday that Sottile had been grievously injured and pledged to\nprotect workers and to prosecute anyone who assaults them.\n\n\n   ``It's really sad when things like that happen, and we're going\nto make sure, to the full extent of the law, that the customer who\ntook that action against one of our employees is prosecuted,''\nBethune said. ``We love our customers, but that means they have to\nrespect our employees.''\n\n\n   Port Authority police said that Sottile was working in Terminal\nC at Gate 115 on Thursday night, preparing to board passengers for\na flight to Orlando when, at about 9:10 p.m., a toddler ran from\nhis parents in the waiting area into the jetway leading to the\naircraft.\n\n\n   The child's mother, accompanied by a Continental gate agent,\nwent into the jetway in pursuit. The child's father, identified as\nDavis, also tried to enter the jetway, but he was barred by Sottile\nbecause he had no boarding pass _ his family had not yet picked\nthem up from the ticket agent at the gate.\n\n\n   Davis, the police report said, became enraged at Sottile, picked\nhim up in a bear-hug, turned him upside down and hurled him,\nhead-first, onto the floor. Sottile suffered several fractures of\nthe spine and neck, as well as head injuries.\n\n\n   Davis walked away, but was seized nearby by Port Authority\nofficers, who handcuffed him. Meanwhile, an ambulance was called,\nand Sottile was taken to University Hospital in Newark, where he\nwas listed in critical but stable condition Saturday.\n\n\n   The suspect was charged with aggravated assault and, after an\narraignment in Essex County Court, was held at the Essex County\nJail in $50,000 bail.

      "content": "Opening of Gaza airport marks emotional day for Palestinians\n\n\n\t   DAHANIEH, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Thousands of Palestinians watched\nbreathlessly as the first Palestine Airlines flight touched down at\nGaza International Airport Tuesday and crew members waved the\nnational green, red, black and white flag from the pilot's window.\n\t   And then, with many holding back tears of joy, the emotional\ncrowd began a spontaneous celebration of dance and song set to last\nfor days. The opening of their first airport was a concrete sign\nfor Palestinians that their lives were becoming freer and their\nhomeland was moving one step closer to statehood.\n\t   ``The meaning of the airport is freedom and the feeling that you\nare a citizen in a country,'' said Shaban Khalil, a 47-year-old man\nfrom Gaza City.\n\t   Gaza International, built with dlrs 75 million in contributions\nmainly from Japan, is petite for an international airport. Sprawled\nover 1,125-acres, it has one runway long enough to accommodate all\nbut the biggest jumbo jets. The one passenger terminal for arrivals\nand departures resembles an Arabian desert palace with arches and\nmulticolored Moroccan tiles and includes a VIP lounge.\n\t   In the first weeks, airport operations will have to rely on some\nimprovisation. Major pieces of equipment, including the controls\nfor the control tower, are still at the Israeli port of Ashdod.\nTuesday's planes were guided to a safe landing by a portable\ncontrol panel installed in a van.\n\t   Israel, which feared a solely-Palestinian run airport would mean\nenemies could land at its door-step or smuggle weapons to the\nPalestinians, held up the opening for two years over security.\n\t   Under the airport agreement, Israel will continue to control the\nairspace and could shut down the airport at any time. With a\nfull-time but discreet monitoring presence there, Israel will\npre-approve all flight schedules and passenger lists. No Israeli\nwill sit in the control tower or operate any area of the airport.\n\t   Tuesday, Israeli and Palestinian security agents greeted an\nEgypt Air flight and collected the passports of the passengers,\nincluding Egyptian Cabinet ministers in small white bags.\n\t   As of Wednesday, Palestinian officials say no Israeli presence\nwill be visible. Arriving passengers will be transferred by buses\nfrom the planes to a security check area in the airport where they\nwill go through metal detectors. Palestinian agents will X-Ray\nluggage and cargo while Israeli monitors observe the security\nchecks from behind one-way mirrors, as they do now at two other\ncrossings into autonomous Palestinian areas.\n\t   If Israel disputes an inspection, the passenger and his luggage\nwill be taken to a separate area where Israelis will carry out an\nadditional check while Palestinian agents observe.\n\t   Palestine Airlines, which already runs a twice-weekly flight to\nJordan from a small airstrip in Egypt, will now operate out of Gaza\nInternational. The brand-new national carrier is starting out with\na fleet of three planes including a Boeing 727 _ a gift from a\nSaudi prince.\n\t   The airport will also be the permanent home of Yasser Arafat's\npresidential plane. A giant portrait of the Palestinian leader hung\nfrom the control tower for the festive opening Tuesday and Arafat\nwas on hand to personally greet seven plane-loads of dignitaries.\n\t   ``This is a preparation for the declaration of the Palestinian\nstate,'' Arafat said, smiling broadly and flashing a V sign.\n\t   Next month, U.S. President Bill Clinton is expected to land\nthere too _ giving implicit recognition for independence, at least\nin Palestinian eyes\n\t   Tuesday's opening was a dramatic event in the history of the\nPalestinian people. Despite the monitoring role, the airport marks\na significant loosening of the Jewish state's security grip over\nthe Palestinians. Years of requests for Israeli permission, often\ndenied, to travel anywhere by land or air are slowly ending. For\npeople in the cramped Gaza Strip which is surrounded by barbed-wire\non three sides and the sea on a fourth, the airport will provide\nthe only",

The amount of crime at the nation's airports is not \nmonitored by any federal agencies unless it has a special relation \nto aviation safety. \n\n\n\t``Security is through the Federal Aviation Administration, but  \nthat's oriented only to terrorism and contraband goods that \nthreaten flights,'' said Bill Mosley, a spokesman with the \nDepartment of Transportation. \n\n\n\tThe airlines do report mishandled baggage, which could be  \nstolen, but otherwise ``street'' crime is considered a local issue \nand not monitored on a national level, he said. \n\n\n\tInstead, law enforcement concentrates on the trends it finds in  \nits own backyard. \n\n\n\tAt Hartsfield, the world's busiest airport with about 73.5  \nmillion passengers annually, larceny is the crime of the year. \nAccording to police statistics compiled by The Atlanta \nJournal-Constitution, theft has climbed 26 percent for the first \nfour months this year. \n\n\n\tCar thefts also have gone up, doubling from 107 in 1997 to 215  \nlast year. \n\n\n\tA 9 percent increase in passenger volume could be partly to  \nblame for the rising thefts, but DeCosta said he's investigating \nwhether a theft ring is canvassing the airport. \n\n\n\tAt D-FW, missing vehicles are the bigger problem.  \n\n\n\t``In the last year we had 180 vehicles stolen from rental  \nagencies,'' said Dodson. ``These are not random thefts. Most of \nthese are employee related. We recover over 80 percent of the \nrental cars that are stolen.'' \n\n\n\tAirline employees also have sometimes been the issue when theft  \noccurs. \n\n\n\tThis April at D-FW, 10 baggage handlers were arrested for  \nstealing property from about 500 bags bound for flights on American \nTrans Air, British Airways, Korean Airlines and Lufthansa. \n\n\n\tIn 1998, a group of baggage handlers at American Airlines in  \nMiami were arrested after a 19-member special security team did a \nsting operation. The 44 baggage handlers were accused of pilfering \nthousands of pieces of jewelry, electronic equipment, cameras and \ncash from inside suitcases as planes arrived and departed. \n\n\n\tBut those aren't the majority of theft cases; much of the  \nstealing is done right in front of the passenger. \n\n\n\tEarlier this year at D-FW a man was charged with habitually  \nstealing those black-wheeled bags that look similar to dozens of \nothers on the baggage carousel. \n\n\n\tHis modus operandi was to steal the common-looking bags and  \nplead ignorance if stopped by the rightful owner. \n\n\n\t``The guy had been making a living out here,'' said Dodson.  \n``He'd been stopped by people but always bluffed his way through.'' \n\n\n\tAltogether, he pirated about $1 million of loot to sell at flea  \nmarkets and a couple of warehouses full of stuff before he was \ncaught. \n\n\n\tAirports in New York have a much bigger problem with pickpockets  \nthan many other cities and police have conducted several sting \noperations to catch regular thieves, according to Bill Cahill, \nspokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. \n\n\n\tMeanwhile, Chicago O'Hare International Airport, which handled  \n72.5 million passengers last year, seems to have the most trouble \nin its bathrooms. \n\n\n\tThefts in airport restrooms have risen 99 percent at O'Hare as  \nmost property crimes decreased. \n\n\n\tOne thing that is rare at airports",
