It is currently 6 billion.\n\n\n   Despite objections towards these and certain other\nrecommendations from a small group of conservative Muslim and Roman\nCatholic countries, backed by the Vatican, the conference adopted\nthem by consensus as part of a new action plan approved Friday for\nreaching the Cairo population goals. Argentina, Nicaragua and the\nVatican filed reservations.\n\n\n   Population officials generally expressed satisfaction with the\nmeeting's outcome. ``Cairo has taken root and is working'' the\nchief U.S. delegate, Undersecretary of State Frank Loy, said at a\nclosing press conference Friday.\n\n\n   Rather than merely setting numerical targets and mounting\nfamily-planning campaigns, the Cairo strategy for limiting\npopulation growth seeks to improve the status of women in the\nbelief that they will then have smaller families.\n\n\n   This week's conference recommended that governments make a\nnumber of adjustments to this strategy mainly in the way they treat\nabortion, the 1.1 billion people in the world between the ages of\n15 and 24 and the estimated 33 million people infected with the\nAIDS virus.\n\n\n   It urged governments to deal resolutely with the damage done to\nwomen by unskilled abortionists, saying that where this practice is\nlegal they should ``train and equip health-service providers and\nshould take other measures to insure that abortion is safe and\naccessible.''\n\n\n   While Chile and El Salvador are the only countries to ban\nabortion outright, another 75 or so only permit it only when a\nwoman's life is directly threatened.\n\n\n   The 1994 Cairo action plan called simply for abortion to be\n``safe'' in countries where it is legal. It did not say abortions\nshould be ``accessible'' or make governments responsible for\ninsuring practitioners are qualified.\n\n\n   Almost equally contentious, however, were the conference's\nrecommendations dealing with young people. It called for school\nchildren, at all levels, to be instructed in ``sexual and\nreproductive health issues'' in order to teach them ``responsible\nsexual behavior'' and protect them from ``unwanted pregnancy'' and\nsexually transmitted diseases.\n\n\n   It also told governments to provide ``special family-planning\ninformation, counseling and health services'' for ``sexually active\nadolescents'' and to help them avoid AIDS.\n\n\n   While governments should respect ``the rights, duties and\nresponsibilities of parents'' as well as ``cultural values and\nreligious beliefs,'' the conference said they should ``safeguard\nthe right of adolescents to privacy, confidentiality and informed\nconsent'' when providing such assistance.\n\n\n   These new recommendations go far beyond those of Cairo, which\nsimply asked governments to provide adolescents with ``guidance in\nsexual and reproductive matters'' and not to restrict their access\nto ``appropriate services and the advice they need.''\n\n\n   Once again, conservative governments sought to emphasize\nparents' right to control all aspects of their children's education\nand to play down the state's role in making sex education and\ncontraceptive advice available to young people.\n\n\n   The conference also recognized that the AIDS pandemic is far\nworse now than expected five years ago by setting new, specific\ntargets for reducing the infection's spread.\n\n\n   By 2005, it said, governments should insure that at least 90\npercent of adolescents have access to ``the information, education\nand services n",

And it is important to\ntighten control over bank credit, and ensure good harvests to help\ncontrol inflation, said the professor.\n\n\nMoreover, Yang praised the successful \"soft landing\" after high\ninflation in 1993-95, and the increasing foreign exchange reserve,\nfrom 19.4 billion U.S. dollars in 1992 to 105 billion U.S. dollars\nby the end of 1996.",

From 1986 through 1995, nearly 6.7\nmillion hectares (16.5 million acres) of farmland were lost to\ndisasters and development, according to a government report\nreleased Friday.\n\t   Lax enforcement of environmental laws and rampant deforestation\n_ leading to soil erosion and silting of riverbeds _ were a major\nfactor behind floods that killed more than 3,000 people this\nsummer, the government has acknowledged.\n\t   In response to the flooding, effective Sept. 1 the government\nbanned logging along the upper reaches of the Yangtze River.\n\t   Zhou refused to answer reporters' questions about how the\ncentral government would pay for the shift from logging to\nreforestation, estimated by Sichuan provincial officials to cost\nmore than 1 billion yuan (dlrs 120 million) annually, and prevent\nillegal logging.\n\t   The government also plans to take some land on steep hillsides\nor along rivers and lakes out of farming to help prevent floods.\n\t   Zhou admitted the process would be gradual, as farmers and\nloggers are moved from mountainsides to wasteland on the plains in\nSichuan to farm.\n\t   ``The process affects people's livelihoods, so we'll be adopting\na very cautious strategy,'' he said.\n\t   The worst flooding since 1954 on the Yangtze River laid bare the\ncost of China's choice of putting fast growth ahead of\nenvironmental protection.\n\t   Sedimentation has reduced the volume of China's huge freshwater\nlakes along the Yangtze _ which served as natural diversion tanks\nfor floodwaters _ by 40 percent, according to figures released\nFriday.\n\t   The land agency's report Friday was one of the first to use new\nestimates that show China has about 40 percent more farmland than\npreviously acknowledged. But even the higher number still leaves\nChina with a small amount of farmland compared to its population:\njust under 10 percent of the world's farmland for 22 percent of the\nworld's population.\n\t   According to the new data, China has 128 million hectares (316\nmillion acres) of farmland, or about 14 percent of its total land,\ncompared with the 93 million hectares (230 million acres) reported\nuntil recently but long known to be an underestimate.\n\t   The new figure was calculated using satellite photography.

It\nis increasingly unclear whether the world will be able to raise\nspending on population policies from $10 billion a year at present\nto the $17 billion required under the new strategy in the year\n2000, or the nearly $22 billion needed by 2015 at a time when\nWestern aid to developing nations is falling.\n\n\n   ``We are having a replay of the differences which surfaced at\nCairo by some of the countries who feel they lost out then,''\nacknowledged Bangladesh's representative, Anwarul Karim Chowdhury,\nchairman of the review conference, which will reconvene next month\nto complete its work.\n\n\n   ``We are sorry to see a meeting that was supposed to take stock\nof how countries are implementing the Cairo program turn into an\nattempt to renegotiate that program,'' said Anika Rahman, of the\nCenter for Reproductive Law and Policy, one of the private lobbying\ngroups attending the talks.\n\n\n   Citing a ``huge gap between promises and performance,'' June\nPersaud, the Guyanese delegate who spoke for the Group of 77, as\nthe 130 developing member countries of the United Nations call\nthemselves, predicted the industrialized world will provide only 33\npercent of the $5.7 billion it is supposed to contribute to the\nprogram by 2000.\n\n\n   Unlike earlier U.N. efforts to curb population growth, which\nemphasized numerical targets, the Cairo strategy assumes women will\nautomatically limit the size of their families as they become\nhealthier, richer and more educated and enjoy a higher social\nstatus.\n\n\n   It calls for universal access to reproductive and sexual health\ncare by 2015 as well as universal access to primary education,\ngender equality and sharp reductions in infant, child and maternal\nmortality.\n\n\n   ``Cairo marks a shift in emphasis in population policy from\ntargets and numbers to improving women's lives,'' said Rosalind P.\nPetchesky, of the International Reproductive Rights Research Action\nGroup. ``You won't stem population growth without bettering the lot\nof women.''\n\n\n   But instead of using last month's review conference to compare\nnational experiences in carrying out the Cairo program, delegates\nfound themselves locked in a linguistic struggle over what they\nshould say about a number of sensitive subjects in the report they\nwill present to a special session of the U.N.

R. Narayanan said here on\nWednesday in his opening address to the Parliament's budget\nsession.\n\n\nMounting fiscal deficit has led to deteriorating fiscal\nposition of both the central government and the states, which is a\nsituation that \"needed to be urgently reversed,\" said the\npresident.\n\n\nThe deficit also reduces public investment, crowds out private\ninvestment, raises interest rates and generates inflationary\npressure, said Narayanan.\n\n\nAccording to the president, gross fiscal deficit of Indian\nstates has touched a record 750 billion rupees (17.44 billion U.S.\ndollars), or 4.3 percent of India's gross domestic product (GDP),\nwhile the burden of interest payments continued to be large at\nabove 4 percent of the GDP.\n\n\nIf India wants to sustain accelerated growth with high\nemployment coupled with modest inflation, he said, the growing\nfiscal deficit needs to be contained.\n\n\n\"We have to adopt measures to curb the rising trend of non-plan\nexpenditure,\" elaborated the president. \"These require difficult\ndecisions on expenditure control, downsizing of government and\nausterity in spending,\" he said.\n\n\nIndia can truly hope to achieve growth rates of well over seven\npercent in the coming years once it achieves fiscal consolidation,\nNarayanan predicted.\n\n\n\"If sacrifices have to be made for achieving this challenging\ngoal, they are well-worth making because the long-term rewards of\nrestructuring will benefit all Indians and will far outweigh the\ntemporary costs,\" he asserted.\n\n\nHe said that the Indian government would announce its new\nagricultural policy and vigorously pursue a coherent plan of\neconomic reforms.\n\n\nThe program of disinvestment and restructuring of public sector\nundertakings also needs to be accelerated, he added.\n\n\nThe government would also make conscious and concerted efforts\nto bring the fruits of economic reforms to those regions and\ncommunities that have so far not benefited from them, Narayanan\nsaid.\n\n\n\"We must lose no more time to eradicate mass poverty, remove\nilliteracy and assure basic minimum services to all our fellow\ncitizens,\" he said, adding \"While accomplishing this historic task,\nwe must simultaneously strengthen social justice, promote gender\njustice, remove regional imbalances and bridge the rural-urban\ndivide.\"\n\n\nHe pointed out that the country cannot achieve the strength and\nprosperity that it desires and is capable of if vast areas and\nlarge sections of the population remain deprived and poor.\n\n\n\"Faster economic growth is a precondition for removing social\nand regional imbalances in development,\" he stressed.",

OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n\n   Paying for the Cairo program is also problematic.\n\n\n   On Tuesday night the conference agreed to reaffirm earlier\npledges on financing the program, which is expected to cost $17\nbillion in 2000, rising to $21.7 billion by 2017.\n\n\n   The pledges commit developing countries to pay two-thirds of the\ntotal and the industrialized world the rest. But both are well\nbehind on their obligations so far. Industrialized countries, which\npromised at Cairo to pay $5.7 billion a year, have contributed only\n$1.9 billion a year on average so far. Developing nations, which\nwere supposed to pay $ 11.3 billion annually, have paid $7.8\nbillion a year on average, with most of that money being spent by\nChina, India, Brazil, Mexico and Indonesia.\n\n\n   Donors have done even worse, however. Their total contributions\nare running at $1.9 billion a year, although at Cairo they pledged\nto provide $5.7 billion annually.\n\n\n   After the April meeting failed to reach agreement the conference\nwas reconvened here last week. But Tuesday night it was still\ndivided on several important issues.\n\n\n   For example, conservatives dislike a call for governments to\nprovide young people with confidential advice on contraceptives and\nreproductive health care, demanding greater parental oversight.\n\n\n   ``If the services are not confidential, young people won't use\nthem,'' said Ardrienne Germaine, president of the International\nWomen's Health Coalition, a New York-based women's group.\n\n\n   Also unpopular with conservative groups is a Mexican proposal to\nencourage sex education in school curricula in order to promote\n``responsible sexual behavior'' and to protect adolescents from\n``pregnancy, unsafe abortion and sexually transmitted diseases.''\n\n\n   Although most nations in the world support the Cairo program,\nthe small conservative faction is able to exercise disproportionate\ninfluence over the roughly 130 developing members of the United\nNations, because these countries try to vote as a bloc.\n\n\n   And all members accept that an agreement that is primarily\nintended to help the developing world reduce its growing population\nwill have little value if these countries",

Her birth was greeted with both fanfare and concern over\nthe nation's escalating growth rate.\n\n\n   Astha -- ''faith'' in Hindi -- was born to Anjana and Ashok Arora\nat 5:05 a.m. Thursday, making India only the second nation after\nChina to exceed a billion people.\n\n\n   With an estimated 42,000 births per day in India, it was\nimpossible to know exactly where the billionth baby would be born,\nbut the government staged the milestone as part of a public\ncampaign to encourage Indians to have smaller families.\n\n\n   Astha, wailing, was wheeled out with her sari-clad mother just\nnine hours after she was born to face a crowd of government\nministers and a horde of journalists at Safdarjang Hospital in the\nIndian capital. She weighed six pounds 13 ounces, doctors said.\n\n\n   ''I feel fine,'' said the mother, Anjana, weak and overwhelmed\nby the chaotic reception. ''I'm happy,'' said Ashok Arora, who\nworks in an automotive spare parts shop for a salary of $50 per\nmonth.\n\n\n   ''Don't crush the baby,'' Sumitra Mahajan, the minister for\nwomen and child welfare, screamed into her microphone as nearly 200\njournalists swarmed over the mother's bed. Hospital guards climbed\nonto a nearby bed and beat back the journalists with wooden\ntruncheons.\n\n\n   Every measure of progress India has made since independence in\n1947 has been swamped by the swelling population: Food production\nhas tripled, yet many people go hungry; literacy has increased, but\nso has the overall number of illiterate people.\n\n\n   The government picked May 11 as the date -- calling it ''a moment\nof celebration, a moment to ponder.'' Health Ministry officials,\nwith the concurrence of the U.N. Population Fund, decreed that a\nbaby girl born this morning in the 1,500-bed Safdarjang Hospital\nwould symbolically mark the milestone. Twenty-four babies were born\nin Safdarjang between midnight and noon.\n\n\n   The choice of a baby girl reflects another part of the\ngovernment's attempts to change Indians' family attitudes:\npromoting fair treatment for infant girls to overcome traditional\nbiases in favor of boys.\n\n\n   The last national census in 1991 said there were 927 women for\nevery 1,000 men in India. Health experts said that reflected a\ntrend in rural and poor areas that gives boys preferential\ntreatment in food and health care. Infanticide of baby girls\nremains a problem.\n\n\n   The billionth birth was hardly cause for celebration. Since its\nindependence, India has had little success curbing its exploding\npopulation. When it became a nation, India had 300 million people.\n\n\n   ''We welcome Astha, but we should also be thinking whether she\nwould get an opportunity for education and health like millions of\nother children,'' said Mahajan, the government minister. ''Will we\nbe able to get her the resources and the opportunities necessary\nfor her future? This is what we have to think about.''\n\n\n   Beginning this morning, a recording by the state-owned telephone\ncompany told anyone who picked up the phone to dial in New Delhi,\n''Our population has now reached 1 billion. Let's have small\nfamilies for a stronger India.''\n\n\n   Projections say that if India does not curtail population growth\nit will surpass China as the world's most populous nation in 50\nyears with 1.5 billion people.\n\n\n   Efforts to encourage family planning among the poor suffered a\nsetback in the 1970s when the government sponsored a mass\nsterilization campaign, in which poor people were duped or paid to\nundergo vasectomies and tubectomies.\n\n\n   The emphasis has changed in the last decade toward educating\nwomen, raising their status and providing better health care.\nNongovernment organizations tour rural areas distributing condoms\nand discussing birth control, but sex education is not taught in\nthe schools.\n\n\n AP-NY-05-11-00 1819",

''All the progress\nwe've made and continue to make will be for nothing if we end up\ndeveloping 3,500 square miles over the next 15 or 20 years.''\n\n\n   The report comes two weeks after an agreement was forged between\nseveral of the Chesapeake Bay states to reduce sprawl.\n\n\n   Governors of the states pledged to reduce by 30 percent the rate\nof urban sprawl in the bay region by 2012. They also resolved to\npermanently protect 1.6 million acres around the bay and restore\n25,000 acres of wetlands by 2010.\n\n\n   The accord was signed by Maryland Gov. Parris Glendening; Gov.\nTom Ridge of Pennsylvania; Gov. Jim Gilmore of Virginia; and Mayor\nAnthony Williams of Washington D.C.\n\n\n   The report comes just days after Glendening was made chairman of\nthe National Governors' Association with a promise to advocate for\ncontrolled growth.\n\n\n   The forecast of dwindling land serves as a warning, Epstein\nsaid, that if the agreement and other measures don't curb sprawl,\ndrastic results will follow.\n\n\n   The report predicts the population living in the six-state bay\nwatershed will grow from 15.5 million to more than 18 million by\n2020. It also found demand for new homes will develop 90,000 acres\nof meadows, forest and farmland every year to build suburbs.\n\n\n   Building new homes, Epstein said, should not necessarily mean\nbulldozing forests and paving new roads for suburbs. New buildings\ncan go up in existing towns and cities, ''filling in'' empty\npockets or poorly planned areas, without paving over more\nwatershed, he said.\n\n\n   But developers are only meeting demand, said Larry Schaffert,\npresident of the Maryland State Builders Association. He is also\nowner of Schaffert Construction Inc., in Myersville, Md.\n\n\n   ''We believe in comprehensive, planned growth, but it may come\ndown to what people want and what they can afford,'' Schaffert\nsaid. ''People are moving to the suburbs because that's where they\nwant to live.''\n\n\n   The goals of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation are already in place\nin Maryland as a key element of Glendening's ''Smart Growth''\ninitiative, said Michelle Byrnie, a spokeswoman for the governor.\n\n\n   ''Here in Maryland, we are taking a very aggressive approach to\npreserving open space and farm land, and directing growth to where\nit makes sense,'' Byrnie said. ''And we are seeing the results.''\n\n\n   For example, during the five years Glendening has been in\noffice, Maryland has permanently preserved 187,000 acres of land.\nAnd in the last two years, the state has preserved more land than\nwas developed, Byrnie said.\n\n\n AP-ES-07-13-00 1651",

You tried to provide people with information about\nhaving fewer children, make condoms and birth control pills\navailable, have population targets and so on,'' said Carl Haub, a\ndemographer at the Population Reference Bureau, a Washington, D.C.,\ndemographics think tank.\n\n\n   ``That was fine 25 years ago, particularly since so many\ncountries then had nothing at all; most of the developing nations\ndidn't even have clinics where people could get information,'' he\nsaid. ``But this is a different time and this is a much, much\nbroader approach, one that goes right to the core of culture,\nfamily life and the relations between men and women,'' he said.\n\n\n   Dramatic reductions in world population growth were never\nexpected in the first five years after Cairo. Nevertheless, there\nhas been a modest decline in the rate of growth, though some of the\nmomentum for a slowdown predated the conference.\n\n\n   There will still be 6 billion people on Earth by October and\nworld population is growing 1.33 percent annually, but that is down\nfrom 1.46 percent in 1995. Demographers are beginning to predict\never-slower growth.\n\n\n   Today, the most likely scenarios show that there will be 8.9\nbillion people in the world by 2050. That is well below U.N.\nestimates of 9.5 billion made in the early 1990s.\n\n\n   ``Growth rates have come down, but no one should be complacent.\nTen billion people will still be living in the world in a few\ndecades and that is an extraordinary number,'' said Abubakar\nDungus, a spokesman for the United Nations population division.\n\n\n   The shift in population strategy that was codified at Cairo was\nborn out of hard evidence from countries like Korea and Italy that\nimprovements in women's health, education, social status and\npolitical power were typically accompanied by lower birthrates.\n\n\n   ``What we have now is an approach that starts with individual\nwomen and recognizes that when women have real choices and\nresources to make decisions about their lives and the lives of\ntheir children, they will have fewer children,'' said Amy Coen,\npresident of Population Action International, a Washington, D.C.,\npopulation research organization.\n\n\n   Coen noted that when families have the confidence that their\nchildren will survive, they tend to have fewer of them. She also\nnoted that in numerous surveys and studies of women in high\nfertility countries show that women understand that fewer children\nmeans a better life for them and their families.\n\n\n   Gender equality was a major goal of the Cairo accords and since\nthen, 76 countries have reported taking significant measures on\ngender policy and law, according to a United Nations survey.\n\n\n   Meanwhile, the U.N. survey found that 54 countries have reported\nnew components and significant measures to improve reproductive\nhealth. The most common of those, added to reproductive health\nprograms since Cairo, was the prevention and treatment of sexually\ntransmitted diseases, including AIDS.\n\n\n   The biggest disappointment of the post-Cairo era, and one sure\nto be discussed in the U.N. sessions this week, has been the\nfailure of the developed nations to live up to the financial\npromises that were made in Egypt five years ago.\n\n\n   The United States, for example, needs to triple its current\nfunding fr",

The policy has turned China into a\nlow birth rate country and churned out many young single children.\n\n\nThe policy does not prohibit a husband and wife who are both\nsingle children from bearing a second baby. However, this is the\nfirst time governments have turned to the law to protect the right.\n\n\nSong says that local governments approved the laws because they\nwant to tackle the aging population problem and maintain a\npopulation balance.\n\n\nThe proportion of people aged over 70 in the total population\nhas increased rapidly to 10 percent in the 20-year course of the\none-child policy, which has put pressure on society.\n\n\nSong says the promulgation of the local laws goes in line with\nthe normal population growth, and noted that there will not be an\nabrupt increase in the Chinese population in the coming years.\n\n\nA survey in Heilongjiang province shows that 69.9 percent of 1,\n0200 respondents aged between 20 and 30 are reluctant to have a\nsecond child.\n\n\nLi Ling, a company clerk in Harbin, noted that having another\nbaby \"will cost a lot of money and make me and my husband tired.\"\n\n\nXie Zhenming, deputy director of the China Population\nInformation Research Institute, says that by 2005 some 20 million\nmarriages will take place in China annually, and only 10 percent\nof the couples will be single children.\n\n\nHe said that if each couple has two children, the added\npopulation will be no more than two million every year, which\nwould have little affect on the nation's population control target.\n\n\nThe Chinese government published a report last month saying\nthat it will bring the population to under 1.4 billion by 2010 and\nthe current birth control policy should be stabilized.\n\n\nMany provinces have increased subsidies for families with one\nchild.",

Japan,\nSouth Korea, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia all experienced a\ntremendous turmoil in financial market and sharp slide in\neconomy. Even worse, economic deterioration triggered social\nchaos and unrests in some countries.\n\n\nTo step out of the crisis, the above-mentioned countries have\nintroduced a series of intense reform and adjustment to their\nfinancial systems, economic management mechanisms and policies.\nSome of the measures have paid off.\n\n\nJapan's economy, which contracted for the first time in 23\nyears in 1997, further deteriorated in fiscal 1998, with gross\ndomestic product (GDP) expected to post a negative growth for the\nfirst time.\n\n\nFacing the worst economic recession since World War II, the\nnew Japanese cabinet has put top priority on economic recovery.\n\n\nTo stabilize its financial system and spur the economy, it\nadopted a series of counter-crisis measures, including a 60\ntrillion yen (about 517.2 billion dollars) financial\nstabilization package and a 24 trillion yen (about 206.9 billion\ndollars) emergency economic stimulus package.\n\n\nThe measures, to a certain extent, eased the country's credit\ncrunch, injected vigor into enterprises, expanded domestic demand\nand helped people restore confidence in the Japanese economy.\n\n\nAs long as Japan further speeds up its economic structural\nreform and relaxes restrictions on economic activities, analysts\nbelieve the Japanese economy will get on a recovery track in\n1999.\n\n\nSouth Korea's economy is expected to have a minus six percent\ngrowth this year, due to the bitter impact of the financial\ncrisis caused by corporate bankruptcies and bad loans of\nfinancial institutions.\n\n\nTo curb the drastic downturn in economy, the government\nconducted intense restructuring and readjustment in financial and\ncorporate sectors, and has made considerable achievement as these\nsectors have shown signs of improvement.\n\n\nThe government has restructured debt-laden financial\ninstitutions by forced shut-down and mergers, thus pushing ahead\nthe readjustment of the industrial structures of corporations.\n\n\nThe Seoul stock and foreign exchange currency markets have\nshown continued upturn since the fourth quarter of 1998, and the\nnation's foreign exchange reserves rose to 50 billion U.S.\ndollars. Economists predicted that the South Korean economy will g\nradually recover in 1999.\n\n\nThailand, another victim of the Asian economic crisis, has\nbasically succeeded in curbing the impact of the crisis.\n\n\nFocusing its reforms on the financial sector, it closed down\n56 debt-ridden financial institutions, amended or passed a number\nof laws to streamline the financial sector, cooled the real\nestate development fever and adjusted deposit and lending rates\nto ease the liquidity crunch.\n\n\nThe reforms have greatly helped ease the crisis. Some\ninternational organizations, including the International Monetary\nFund (IMF), maintained that Thailand could be the first Southeast\nAsian country to get out of the crisis.\n\n\nThe Thai government, while predicting a minus 7 percent\neconomic growth for 1998, believed the economy would bottom out\nnext year and reach a 1 percent growth by year's end.\n\n\nMalaysia got into an economic recession in 1998 with its real\nGDP estimated to contract by 6.2 percent, a \"severe and\nunprecedented\" contraction",

Special Session on Environment today that\nChina has achieved great progress in the field of sustainable\ndevelopment since the 1992 Earth Summit.\n\n\n\"I am glad to report to this Assembly that while registering\nrapid economic growth in recent years, China has basically avoided\ndrastic environmental degradation and even registered some partial\nimprovement in the nation's environment,\" he said.\n\n\nThe U.N. Special Session on Environment comes five years after\nthe Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro where 10,000 diplomats and\nenvironmentalists outlined an ambitious blueprint to safeguard the\nplanet, which is later known as Agenda 21.\n\n\nIn a six-page speech to the Special Session, Song Jian outlined\nsix areas where China has gained progress by promoting sustainable\ndevelopment according to Agenda 21:\n\n\n-- Since the early 1990s, China's GNP has been growing at an\naverage annual rate of more than 10 percent and the\npoverty-stricken population has declined from 80 million to 58\nmillion at present;\n\n\n-- Rapid population growth has been brought under control and\nthe nation's natural population growth rate has dropped steadily;\n\n\n-- Notable achievements have been made in comprehensively\nutilizing resources by promoting their conservation and by relying\non scientific and technological progress;\n\n\n-- Efforts have been made to promote clean production\nprocesses. The increase in discharged pollutants has been\neffectively curbed by the closing down of 62,000 seriously\npolluting enterprises;\n\n\n-- More attention has been given to forest cultivation and a\nnation-wide voluntary afforestation drive. Man-made forests now\ncover 34.25 million hectares. Forest coverage increased from 12.98\npercent in 1992 to 13.92 percent in 1996;\n\n\n-- Greater efforts have been devoted to preserving\nbio-diversity. A network of nature reserves has basically taken\nshape, covering 71.85 million hectares or 7.2 percent of China's\ntotal territory. Most of the endangered species are being\naffectively protected.\n\n\nSong told the assembly that these achievements have been scored\nby the Chinese people and government by mainly relying on their\nown efforts, which proves the effectiveness of China's policy of\nintegrating environmental and economic development.\n\n\nIn accordance with Agenda 21, he said, China took the lead to\nformulate \"China's Agenda 21,\" -- the White Paper on China's\nPopulation, Environment and Development in the 21st Century, which\nsets forth the guiding principles of holistic planning and\ncoordinated development of economy, society, resources and\nenvironment.\n\n\nNoting the severe environmental challenges China is still\nfaced, Song expressed optimism towards the future of the country\nin accomplishing the goals of basically providing adequate food\nand clothing to the poverty-stricken population by the end of the\ncentury, achieving zero population growth around the year of 2030\nand doing a good job in environmental protection.\n\n\n\"As the biggest developing country in the world, China will\ncontribute significantly to global environmental protection and\neconomic development by running her own affairs well,\" he said.",

The U.S. Census Bureau estimated it already happened\nSunday.\n\n\n   As Earth's human population crosses the 6 billion threshold,\ninternational development agencies with ties to Atlanta are working\nhard to stem the growth _ not because the planet cannot sustain so\nmany people but because high population growth threatens efforts to\nimprove the lives of the world's poor.\n\n\n   The U.N. Foundation, set up to distribute Atlanta businessman\nTed Turner's $1 billion gift to U.N.-related causes, has made\npopulation control one of its main focuses.\n\n\n   The Carter Center is concentrating on food supply and ways to\nimprove health delivery systems in 25 countries.\n\n\n   And the relief agency CARE, an organization that had no family\nplanning program as recently as 1991, now helps offer birth control\nto 4 million people in 36 countries, said Maurice Middleberg, the\norganization's director of health and population programs.\n\n\n   ``Our goal, God willing, is that we will serve over the next\nfive years something on the order of 14 million,'' Middleberg said.\n\n\n   Fourteen million. Six billion. What do the numbers mean? To put\nit in perspective, consider that one-tenth of all the people who\nhave ever lived on planet Earth are alive today.\n\n\n   ``In 1800, the world's population reached 1 billion. By 1930, it\nwas 2 billion. Now, we're heading toward 6 billion,'' said Peter\nBahouth, executive director of the Turner Foundation. ``The world's\npopulation is increasing by 78 million people a year _ that's the\npopulation of Greece, Sweden and France combined.''\n\n\n   Since the time his boss Turner was born roughly 60 years ago,\nthe world has added 2 billion people, Bahouth said. ``That's\namazing. It's just an incredible statistic.''\n\n\n   Even though fertility rates are decreasing, the United Nations\nprojects a population of 9 billion by 2050. Bahouth said the growth\nrate will not stabilize for years because of what is known as\n``demographic momentum.''\n\n\n   ``There are already so many young people,'' he said.\n\n\n   Many of the 1 billion people ages 15 to 24 and the 2 billion\nunder age 15 are destined to become parents. That's why the Turner\nFoundation is focusing special attention on adolescents.\n\n\n   ``There is the largest ever group of adolescents that the world\nhas ever seen,'' said Ellen Marshall, program officer for\npopulation and women for the U.N. Foundation. ``Looking at what\n(adolescents') opportunities are and the decisions they make is\ngoing to have an enormous impact on their countries and the\nworld.''\n\n\n   In Georgia, for example, the Turner Foundation funds the Georgia\nCampaign for Adolescent Pregnancy and Prevention, which, Bahouth\nsaid, concentrates on providing good health care and opportunities\nfor youths without early pregnancy.\n\n\n   Such educational programs coupled with better access to\ncontraception are the only way to start curbing population growth,\nexperts say. But a variety of economic and cultural reasons hamper\naccess to birth control for women in developing nations.\n\n\n   Agencies like CARE, which has its U.S. headquarters in Atlanta,\nhave taken on the task of easing accessibility. In Ghana, for\nexample, CARE trains hairdressers on how to use condoms so that\nthey can show their customers.\n\n\n   ``(People) get their hair done, and while they're waiting, they\nalso pick up their contraceptives,'' said spokeswoman Cynthia\nGlocker.\n\n\n   Even where there is availability of birth control, bad\ninformation often abounds.\n\n\n   ``You talk to women, and they'll say things like: `Is the IUD\ngoing to float in my body? I've heard stories that it enters my\nlungs. Or the pill gives you cancer,''' said CARE's Middleberg.\n\n\n   A problem, say family planning workers, is that it takes a long\ntime to change perceptions and beliefs, and ultimately, ways of\nlife.\n\n\n   ``It takes years to see results,'' said Gordon Streeb, associate\nexecutive director of the Carter Center.",

      "content": "NEWS STORY \n 2000-07-22 14:53 \n India To Set Up Population Fund  \nBy KRISHNAN GURUSWAMY\n\n\n   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- Seeking to curb India's high birth rate,\nPrime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee pledged Saturday to set up a\nspecial fund to promote family planning programs across the world's\nsecond most populous nation.\n\n\n   The government also will set up a group to prepare programs for\nspecific areas, particularly the northern states, which account for\nhalf of India's population, Vajpayee told the National Commission\non Population in New Delhi.\n\n\n   India's 1 billion population is larger than any nation except\nChina. Experts fear that if India's rate of population growth does\nnot slow, it will become the world's most populated country in 45\nyears.\n\n\n   Vajpayee urged companies, voluntary agencies and individuals to\ncontribute to the National Population Stabilization Fund, which\nwould direct the money to family planning programs. He gave very\nfew details of the programs, but said he hoped the population would\nstabilize within two decades.\n\n\n   ''Achieving this is a challenge. But once we overcome the\nchallenge, we can truly develop our national human resource into a\nformidable force ... for all-around prosperity,'' he said.\n\n\n   The state-run Planning Commission will provide $22.5 million for\nthe fund, officials said.\n\n\n   He urged states to make good use of health, education and\nrelated development programs and provide better access to\ninformation on contraception and child care.\n\n\n   In 1952, India adopted a national family planning program, the\nfirst country in the world to do so. The aim was to ''reduce the\nbirth rate to the extent necessary to stabilize the population at a\nlevel consistent with the requirement of the national economy.''\n\n\n   But many Indians, especially women, were without basic health\ncare, or the literacy skills to understand family planning.\n\n\n   ''A reality check ... reveals rather disturbing facts,''\nVajpayee said. Nearly one in 10 children dies before the age of\nfive, he said. Half of the children under the age of four are\nundernourished; 30 percent of the newborns are underweight and 60\npercent of women are anemic.\n\n\n   Vajpayee said India must reduce infant and maternal mortality\nand meet the demand for contraception. Condoms are available, but\nthe condom campaign is aimed mostly at preventing sexually\ntransmitted diseases. In a country where millions are at or below\nthe poverty level and live in rural areas, spending money on\ncondoms is not a consideration.\n\n\n   The National Commission on Population includes federal and state\ngovernments, voluntary agencies and individuals and aims at\npromoting better coordination among various agencies to curb\npopulation growth.\n\n\n AP-NY-07-22-00 1453",

The lumbering state-owned sector and the massive\nlay-offs of workers, for instance, still put great pressure on the\nnational economy and the whole society.\n\n\nBut the accelerated state enterprise reform and the launching\nof a \"re-employment project\" also presage optimism: the Chinese\ngovernment is determined to pull the large- and medium-size state\nenterprises out of their financial dilemma by the end of this\ncentury.\n\n\nAs Zhang Haoruo, vice-minister of the State Commission for\nRestructuring the Economy has predicted, the nationwide reform of\nstate-owned enterprises, the banking sector, social\nsecurity system and market system is bound to make a breakthrough\nby the year 2000, and the long-existing problems stemming from the\nplanned economy will also basically be solved by then.",

He said the conclusion was drawn\nfollowing comprehensive study based on a recent sample survey by\nthe State Statistics Bureau (SSB) and on thorough consideration\nthat some local officials might have concealed accurate population\nfigures.\n\n\nPopulation control is a vital part in China's family planning,\na basic state policy. The population control goal is set in line\nwith the most populous country's social and economic development\nprogram. Total population in China stood at 1.248 billion at the\nend of 1998, according to the SSB.\n\n\nThe figure includes an increase of 11.84 million, up 0.95\npercent from the previous year, and after subtracting the number\nof 8.07 million people who died in the year.\"This was the first\ntime China's population growth rate was below one percent since\nthe 1970s,\" said Yang.\n\n\nLatest statistics show that population growth continued to slow\ndown in the first half of this year, and many experts believe that\nChina will probably add another 11 or 12 million people this year\nto bring the total population to around 1.26 billion.\n\n\nAverage reproduction rate of Chinese women at child-bearing age\nhas dropped from 1970's 5.8 to two in 1997, placing China among\nthe low birth rate countries in the world.\n\n\nThe slowdown in population growth is also attributable to a\ngradual change in people's attitudes towards having children.\nPeople used to be obsessed with a long-standing concept: more\nchildren, more happiness.\n\n\nFrom the 1st century A.D. to 1949, China's population increased\nten-fold to reach 500 million. But the figure astonishingly\ndoubled in the following 30 years.\n\n\nIn 1982, China introduced the One-Child policy (one child per\ncouple), with some exceptions in rural areas which means that some\nfarmers can ask permission to have a second baby.\n\n\nReal progress in keeping the count down were first seen in\ncities, where the people are better-off and life style is more\nmodern, and where some couples are actually not inclined to have a\nbaby anyway.\n\n\nAccording to Yang, major cities in ten eastern provinces have\nactually reported a zero growth rate of population.\n\n\nThe major obstacles are in rural areas, where 70 to 80 percent\nof the Chinese people live. Serious consideration is given in\nthese places to maintaining traditional philosophies such as the\ncontinuation of the clan which can only be realized by a male\nchild. Its interruption would be a catastrophe for a family.\n\n\nWhat follows does not usually have a happy ending. Families\nwith more children tend to be more poverty-stricken because\nfeeding them is a difficult job, not to say their schooling.\n\n\nToday, however, the situation has changed in many areas. \"In\nour village, 69 women are qualified to apply to have a second baby\nin accordance with the government policy, but only nine have\nexpressed any interest,\" said Xue Yuhuan, a villager of Qidingshan\nvillage in coastal Liaoning province.\n\n\nIn another case, Yao Anhua, a farmer in the Baise Prefecture in\nsouthwest Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, said that he did not\nwant to have more children. Instead, he would place top priority\non his kid's education which he said would help the child find a\nwell-paid job in the future.\n\n\nAccording to Chao Jingchun, a member of the China Population\nSociety, the biggest change in attitudes is because an increasing\nnumber of people realize that the government's targets are\nactually in their personal interests.\n\n\nThe development of a socialist market economy, the mounting\nmedia campaigns, and the improvement of the social welfare system,\nhelped in transforming people's way o",

But, my first two children were girls who couldn't drive\nthe camels to do heavy work. So I had a third child -- a boy who\nis now six years old.\"\n\n\nShe said the local government understood her difficulties and\nwhen she was about to have her third child, they arranged for a\nspecial medical team that drove more than 100 kilometers to her\nhouse.\n\n\nChina adopted its one-child policy in the late 1970s to curb\nthe dramatic population growth, but eased family planning\nrestrictions for families of ethnic groups, even though family\nplanning was also advocated for better economic and cultural\ndevelopment in ethnic areas and to improve the quality of their\nlives.\n\n\nLiu Zhilan, the director of the Family Planning Commission of\nthe Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, said that the 48 ethnic\ngroups there include Mongolians, Huis, and Manchus, most of them\nliving in border areas that are sparsely populated and with a\nharsh environment.\n\n\nInner Mongolia covers 1.18 million square kilometers, 12.3\npercent of China's total landspace, and has a population of 23\nmillion, which accounts for 1.8 percent of the nation's total. The\nregion's birth rate stands at 9.6 per thousand, lower than the\ncountry's average.\n\n\nFifty years ago, the Mongolian population, the major ethnic\ngroup there, had declined sharply. These people, with their\nglorious history, had only 680,000 people when the autonomous\nregion was established in 1947.\n\n\nThe number of Mongolians came to 3.7 million, accounting for\n15.8 of the region's total population, and the group's birth rate\nwas 20 per thousand. Other minority groups amounted to nearly\n850,000 people and had a birth rate of 15 per thousand.\n\n\nLiu said that since the early 1950s the central government has\nsent a large number of medical personnel to the vast Inner\nMongolian grasslands to combat epidemic and infectious diseases\nlike plague and venereal disease. Quite a few Mongolian women who\nhad become infertile because of the venereal disease regained\ntheir reproductive capacity after receiving treatment.\n\n\nThe Mongolian population has seen rapid growth in the past few\nyears and numbered 3.7 million by the end of 1996.\n\n\nThe nomadic life has meant that Mongolians tend to have fewer\nchildren, and although their living conditions have greatly\nimproved, they still follow that tradition. However, the women of\nother minority groups still expect to have more children.\n\n\nLiu Zhilan, who has been involved in family planning for more\nthan 20 years, says that the regional government has focused on\nimproving the quality of life in the ethnic population rather than\ncurbing their numbers.\n\n\nThe region has several hundred schools and family planning\nservice centers for the nomadic population. Medical workers go by\nhorse or car for more than a hundred kilometers to provide medical\ncheck-ups for pregnant women and family planning advice.\n\n\nLiu says that more than 90 percent of the towns and villages\nare even equipped with ultrasound equipment.",

      "content": "A GROWING POLITICAL CAUSE: DECRYING SUBURBAN SPRAWL \n\n\n\n   LOS ANGELES _ The word ``sprawl'' does not even appear in the\nindex of ``Earth in the Balance,'' Vice President Al Gore's earnest\n1992 treatise on the environment. But these days that word _ which\nembraces a set of creeping suburban problems from traffic\ncongestion to loss of open space _ has emerged as one of the\nreigning buzzwords in the political lexicon.\n\n\n   Politicians as diverse as Gore and Gov. Christie Whitman of New\nJersey have made the issue a priority, and voters around the nation\nhave shown their concern in the most tangible way that taxpayers\ncan, by passing billions of dollars in bond measures to buy and\npreserve undeveloped land and approving ballot measures intended to\nslow growth.\n\n\n   Sprawl, in sum, is the new language of environmentalism. It is\nseen by political strategists as perhaps the best way to engage\nvoters in a debate that had become more abstract over the last two\ndecades as regulation curbed many of the most egregious\nenvironmental abuses, from pesticides to pollution, that had\nanimated suburbanites in the 1970s.\n\n\n   The new debate is being driven by some of the same concerns that\ninspired the original movement, but now the length of a commuter's\ndaily drive is increasingly seen as an environmental issue like\nchlorofluorocarbons or global warming. And political strategists\nsay that the voters who are most concerned about these issues _\nsuburban women _ are a voting group that helps decide elections.\n\n\n   ``In a period of prosperity, it's not about how much we have;\nit's about how we hold our lives together,'' said Alex Castellanos,\na Republican political consultant who has worked for candidates in\nstates like Texas and Florida and helped spread the concept of the\nsoccer mom. ``So all these quality-of-life issues, from health care\nto the environment, come to the fore. A lot of it is the\nfeminization of politics. The warrior of the suburban jungle is the\nmom out there in her suburban assault vehicle, and there's no oasis\nfor her, no place for her to rest.\n\n\n   ``Where Joe Six-Pack is not concerned about green space, he is\nnot the dominant force on the spectrum anymore.''\n\n\n   With its Teddy Roosevelt-style emphasis on conservation in the\nclassic sense, the fight against untrammeled sprawl finds an\nequally comfortable place in Gore's emerging presidential campaign\ntheme of ``practical idealism'' and in the ``compassionate\nconservative'' mantra of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. And although\nit has not emerged as a top-tier issue like education or crime in\npublic opinion surveys, it is steadily gaining.\n\n\n   In Ventura County, just west of here, voters in November\noverwhelmingly approved a ballot initiative called SOAR _ for Save\nOpen Space and Agricultural Resources _ which will force every\npropsed development that requires a zoning change to be approved\nby a public referendum. Similar measures were passed in four\nindividual cities within the county, just one beachhead among some\n200 measures worth $7 billion that passed nationwide.\n\n\n   In New Jersey, Gov. Whitman successfully pressed for $1 billion\nin borrowing to set aside half the state's remaining 2 million\nacres of open space over the next 10 years. Voters overwhelmingly\napproved the measure in November.\n\n\n   A statewide survey last year by the Public Policy Institute of\nCalifornia found that more than a quarter of Californians saw\npopulation growth and development as a big problem in their region\n_ hardly a surprise in a state that is expected to add 18 million\nmore people, an entire New York state, to its current population of\nmore than 32 million people by the year 2025. In the San Francisco\nBay area, where Silicon Valley has fueled a boom, nearly 40 percent\nof respondents saw growth as a major problem, while a third of\nresidents statewide saw transportation and traffic congestion as a\nbig problem.\n\n\n   ``It's an issue which, on the surface, seems like a very\npolicy-wonk kind of thing,'' said Mark Baldassare, survey director\nfor the nonpartisan institute. ``But there's a lot",

      "content": "BRIGHT SPOT IS CITED ON POPULATION CONTROL \n\n\n\n   The 6 billionth human being on Earth, who by United Nations\nestimates was born Tuesday, arrived nearly a year late _ one of an\nincreasing number of bright spots in the world population picture.\n\n\n   Population control ``was an area of doom and gloom, and everyone\nsaid nothing could be done,'' said Dr. Nafis Sadik, director of the\nUnited Nations Population Fund, in an interview Thursday, ``and it\nwas not so.''\n\n\n   The late arrival of the 6 billionth, she said, represented a\nsubstantial slowing of the rate of population growth since the 1994\nInternational Conference on Population and Development, in Cairo.\nBased on demographic trends at the time, the 6 billion mark should\nhave been reached in 1998.\n\n\n   At a population conference &UR;  &LR; Simmons College in Boston, where she\nwas keynote speaker, Sadik also said that, based on current trends,\nthe next 1 billion jump in global population will take 14 years _\ntwo years longer than the previous rise of a billion, and another\nsign of slowing rates of growth.\n\n\n   Sadik, whose agency provides population-program assistance to\nmore than 140 countries and territories around the world, said\ngains are being made mostly because women are gaining the power to\nmake their own reproductive decisions.\n\n\n   Surveys prior to the Cairo conference showed that people in all\nregions of the world desired a family size lower than the usual\nfamily size where they lived, she said, but lack of information,\nlack of access to contraceptives, and a feeling among women that\nthey could not make reproductive decisions had contributed to\nkeeping family size up.\n\n\n   Since the conference, she said, change has been dramatic:\nFamily-planning information and services are available in virtually\nevery country, use of contraceptives is up, and fertility is\ngenerally down.\n\n\n   After the conference, nations turned away from top-down efforts\nat population control, such as China's one-child policy, and toward\nbetter education and health care for girls and greater gender\nequality.\n\n\n   ``Top-down policies in India and China led to coercion,\npoor-quality services, deceptions, draconian measures,'' Sadik\nsaid. Now that such quotas, targets, and regulations have been\ndropped, and governments are concentrating on providing information\nand services, better results are being achieved, because ``most\nwomen didn't want to have that many children.''\n\n\n   The effort to control population is far from finished, she said,\nnoting that there are currently 1.04 billion people in the\n15-to-24age group, and ``the decisions these young people make will\nhave a very big effect.\n\n\n   Nevertheless, ``I don't think there are any negative trends in\nthe developing world,'' Sadik said, adding that developed countries\nthat have problems with too-low birth rates might also benefit from\nimproving the situation of women. A case in point is Japan, where\nthe population is rapidly aging but young women are avoiding\nchild-bearing.\n\n\n   In Japan ``women are totally responsible for bringing up the\nchildren, and it is onerous,'' Sadik said. ``Not every child is a\nsuccess,'' and in Japan the mother is held responsible. Japan is\nsupplanting the United States as the broker of international\npopulation agreements _ a result of faltering US financial support\nfor the UN and its programs, and of what she called the\npreoccupation of the US Congress with abortion, which blocks\neffective US participation in family planning efforts in the\ndeveloping world.",
