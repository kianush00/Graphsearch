And who needs an eye\npatch when you can snatch a nice pair of imitation Ray Ban\nsunglasses from the captain of the ship you've just raided?\n\n\n   Aliasa Bungalos, known and feared as ``Commander Alex'' around\nthe lawless islands and hidden coves that dot the turquoise waters\nof the Southern Philippines, is a latter-day Captain Kidd.\n\n\n   Guarded by a crew masked in balaclavas and bandannas and\nbrandishing M-16s, Bungalos recently let a journalist visit a\ndeserted island hideout, 11 miles east of the Philippine Navy's\nsouthern base in Zamboanga City, for an extraordinary look at the\nlife of a pirate leader. Casually, he described what he does for a\nliving: sneaking up on ships in a fast launch, clambering up ropes\nto board under cover of night, kidnapping and ransoming victims,\nselling off the stolen loot.\n\n\n   He is hardly unique.\n\n\n   Piracy is back with a vengeance, and Bungalos is one of tens of\nthousands of bandits of the sea who have spurred its resurgence\nover the past decade. They prey on merchant mariners, fishermen,\nshippers, even pleasure sailors and scuba divers of all\nnationalities. Seajacking also poses severe environmental and\nsafety hazards in busy sea lanes. In 1994, two oil tankers collided\nand burned, killing all aboard, after what was thought to be a\npirate attack.\n\n\n   The number of reported pirate attacks has set a record this\nyear, and Asian waters are the new buccaneers' favored haunt. The\nregion's financial crisis, which began three years ago, the\npolitical instability and armed insurgencies, and some of the\nglobe's busiest shipping lanes, have made Asia the site of three of\nfour pirate attacks worldwide.\n\n\n   But forget ``Yo ho ho, and a bottle of rum.'' Piracy does not\nfit the Hollywood image of Treasure Island, swashbuckling fun, and\ntalking parrots. Buccaneers who terrorized the Caribbean in the\n1700s were merciless criminals who forced their victims to walk the\nplank while they stole a ship and its cargo.\n\n\n   Modern pirates are sometimes members of sophisticated crime\nsyndicates who use global positioning systems, satellite phones,\nfalsified papers, and powerful speedboats to pull off\nmultimillion-dollar heists of tankers and cargo ships. But more\noften they are hit-and-run bandits in motorized dinghies who prey\non fishermen, ferries, and yachtsmen, robbing them of any valuables\naboard. Bungalos's gang is one of these.\n\n\n   What's common to almost all of these attacks is their\nruthlessness, the use of deadly weapons _ from knives and handguns\nto antitank rockets and mortars _ and the cost to the maritime\nworld in lives, cargo, and ships.\n\n\n   With 90 percent of the world's trade moving by ship, and nearly\nhalf of it passing through Asia's pirate-infested waters, the\nthreat to global commerce is growing. Estimates of the cost of\npiracy and maritime fraud run to more than $16 billion a year.\n\n\n   The pettiest incidents are essentially maritime muggings by\nthose who subsist by stealing fish, mooring lines, or cans of\npaint.\n\n\n   The most serious are meticulously planned attacks in which\norganized crime gangs target valuable cargo, resell it in advance,\nand prepare fake registration papers for a ship.\n\n\n   In the worst cases, pirates kill the crew, repaint and rename\nthe vessel, and use the ``phantom ship'' to attack other vessels or\nto steal millions of dollars of cargo from unsuspecting shippers\nwho unwittingly hire the pirates' fly-by-night company to transport\ntheir goods.\n\n\n   Shipowners reported 300 attacks or attempted attacks in 1999 to\nthe International Maritime Bureau, an industry watchdog, and 309 to\nthe United Nations' International Maritime Organization.

Marwando gazes out at the shimmering sea from a clump of palm\ntrees, standing guard on the front line of the international war\nagainst piracy.\n\n\n   A few miles to the north, the Singapore skyline adorns the\nhorizon. Between the affluent city-state and this tiny Indonesian\nisland inhabited only by a handful of navy frogmen, lies the\nworld's most congested -- and potentially dangerous -- shipping lane.\n\n\n   The narrow straits of Malacca and Singapore are the most\npirate-infested waterways of the world. Despite the vigilance of\nMarwando and his fellow lookouts, the buccaneers have exacted an\nincreasingly heavy toll on international shipping.\n\n\n   When Philippine rebels on boats recently took 21 hostages from a\nresort island in Malaysia, the world's attention was again focused\non this centuries-old problem.\n\n\n   Experts warn that major collisions and ecological disasters\ncould occur, because the pirates have taken to shackling crews on\ntheir oil tankers and setting the vessels adrift.\n\n\n   In the most extreme cases, crime syndicates employ hardened\ncriminals who sometimes execute entire crews. The vessels are then\nrenamed, and their cargos sold at distant foreign anchorages where\ncorrupt officials can be bribed to look the other way.\n\n\n   Desperate to stem the brazen attacks on its side of the narrows,\nIndonesia's ill-equipped navy has appealed for foreign donations of\nhigh-tech equipment such as naval radars and computer systems.\n\n\n   ''We need night-vision equipment with video cameras to film the\nbandits, more speedboats for our frogmen, global positioning\nsystems, that sort of thing,'' said Col. Boedi Setyadi, commander\nof the Batam naval base that controls the Indonesian side of the\nstraits.\n\n\n   But efforts to modernize the service have been crippled by the\nUnited States, Indonesia's traditional source of weaponry, which\nimposed a ban last year on military exports following the\ndestruction of East Timor.\n\n\n   According to the London-based International Maritime Bureau's\nlatest survey, 19 pirate attacks were recorded in Indonesia in the\nfirst three months of this year, compared to 18 cases during the\nsame period in 1999 and 10 in 1998. That means the waterway\naccounts for one-third of all maritime attacks.\n\n\n   Every year, more than 50,000 ships ply the straits, which link\nEurope and Asia. An armada of tankers, container ships, liquefied\nnatural gas carriers and other merchant vessels tail one another in\nshort intervals as they traverse the five-mile-wide stretch of\nwater opposite Singapore.\n\n\n   The pirates lurk in the countless inlets and mangrove swamps\nthat dot the coastline of Sumatra or among the hundreds of islets\nand reefs near Singapore. Their speedboats quickly slither in and\nout of the sea lanes under cover of darkness to plunder and then\nrun for cover.\n\n\n   Pulling up alongside ships, modern swashbucklers use grappling\nhooks to hoist themselves onto the vulnerable, heavily laden\nvessels. They usually surprise and overwhelm the crews, who are\nwarned against trying to repel the invaders by force.\n\n\n   Shipping insurers and governments have called for coordinated\naction to halt the terror and make the crowded waterway safe for\nseafarers. As a result, officials from 16 Asian countries agreed\nlast month during a Tokyo conference to develop strategies for\nfighting piracy in the region.\n\n\n   ''Only government action can eradicate attacks in this area,''\nsaid Neil Choong, a spokesman for the International Maritime\nBureau's regional office in Malaysia. ''As long as there is a\nsignificant naval presence, the number of incidents will be\nreduced.''\n\n\n   The robberies also frequently go unreported by the victims,\nbecause police investigations entail lengthy delays for ships whose\noperating costs can reach $10,000 per day.\n\n\n   Last week, Indonesia's navy chief of staff, Adm. Achmad\nSutjipto, said his service would need to more than double its 114\nvessels, many d",

Suddenly, two masked men wielding M-1 rifles sped up\nalongside in a motorized canoe and shouted, ``Ambak pare!''_ ``Jump\noverboard, pal!''\n\n\n   He obeyed, and in a matter of seconds, the pirates stole his\nentire life savings and his means of livelihood _ a tiny boat with\nan outboard engine.\n\n\n   ``I thought I going to drown,'' said Quino, 34, who was rescued\nby a passing fisherman. But his problems had just begun.\n\n\n   In this village of 200 subsistence fishermen and their families,\nhe is one of 50 victims who have lost their boats or engines to\nsmall-time but heavily armed pirates. Every penny of the\nfishermen's earnings had gone into their tiny boats, and with an\naverage income of $77 a month, not one believes he will ever save\n$700 to buy a new boat, engine, and nets. They now borrow dinghies\nfrom their luckier neighbors and split the catch with them 50-50.\n\n\n   Victims of modern piracy come in all stripes _ from poor\nfishermen who lose their livelihoods, to shipping tycoons who have\nto write off multimillion-dollar tankers, to yachtsmen whose\nvacations turn into nightmares.\n\n\n   ``Seventy-eight seafarers were killed by pirates in 1998, most\nof them in Asian waters,'' said Corey Bousen, publisher of Lloyd's\nList Maritime Asia, a trade journal. ``If 78 Americans were\nmurdered on a bus in downtown Boston, you'd hear about it for 10\nyears. But because these killings are at sea, and most victims are\nfrom third-world countries, nobody takes notice.''\n\n\n   The maritime industry has started to mobilize, however.\nShipowners are debating the merits of hiring former soldiers to\nescort or recover their ships, and some have installed hidden\ntracking devices to monitor vessels if they are seajacked. Crews\nare urged to keep fire hoses ready to ward off attackers, and post\nsailors on round-the-clock watches on floodlit decks.\n\n\n   Some captains now avoid the most dangerous waters of Indonesia\nand Malaysia and the coasts of Bangladesh and Somalia. Yachtsmen\nhave begun to sail in convoys and skip some deserted ``paradise\nisles.''\n\n\n   Mike Severns, a Maui-based underwater photographer and biologist\nwho used to lead yacht trips to remote islands, still feels a chill\nwhen he recalls a horrifying Indonesian holiday two years ago.\n\n\n   He and six friends had anchored their 90-foot ironwood boat off\nthe island of Salajar, by the southern tip of western Sulawesi.\n``We had just finished dinner,'' Severns recounted, ``and before we\nknew what happened, we turned around, and instead of the crew, we\nsaw 12 men with handguns.\n\n\n   ``This is the horror of piracy. You're in the middle of nowhere,\nno one knows where you are, and there's no place to run. They could\nhave shot us, ransacked the boat and sunk it, and no one would have\nknown.''\n\n\n   Severns talked his way out of the situation, addressing the men\nas if they were maritime police conducting a search, and telling\nthem he worked for the national airline's flight magazine, which\nseemed to impress them. ``I guess they figured robbing us could\nbring a problem, and we weren't worth their while.'' But that was\nfar from the end of his adventures.\n\n\n   Six months later, off the northern tip of Babar Island, 200\nmiles east of East Timor, he and five friends were doing a night\nscuba dive when they were surrounded by canoes filled with\nscreaming attackers. Severns, the divers' guide, and the captain of\ntheir boat were taken ashore, where the guide and the captain were\nbeaten nearly unconscious, while the others escaped back to the\nboat.\n\n\n   The attackers had heard that ``tourists are rich, and they\nthought we'd have thousands of dollars lying around on deck,''\nSeverns said.\n\n\n   Although his jaw was broken, the captain managed to escape and\nswimback to the yacht. ``The last thing he saw was mobs attacking\nus, and he gave the order to",

In the Philippines, as in other archipelago nations\nlike Indonesia or Malaysia, there are simply too many islands to\nmonitor around the clock.

Last week, the group seized a 24-year-old\nAmerican and held him in a hideout on Jolo Island, where they\nreportedly demanded $10 million for his release.\n\n\n   ``When they see the Navy, they act like good guys. When the Navy\nisn't here, they're bad guys,'' Lieutenant Bonifacio Manicap said,\naiming his binoculars at rows of laundry flapping from lines on one\nof the hundreds of islands on the gunboat's patrol route, and at a\nhandful of people on a nearly deserted beach who stared back\nsuspiciously.\n\n\n   Balanon, the commander, pointed to a tangle of brush along the\ncoast of Pilas Island that looked much like any other _ until a\nsquint of the eye revealed a tiny gap just large enough for a\ncanoe, opening into a hidden lagoon.\n\n\n   Getting off a gunboat to pursue fleeing suspects into shallow\nwaters means abandoning the ship's formidable weaponry. Clambering\ninto an inflatable raft armed with just a .45-caliber handgun,\nManicap was understandably nervous.\n\n\n   ``These pirates have machine guns left over from World War II\nthat could sink a boat,'' he said. ``They have antitank guns.

A\nformer Muslim rebel leader negotiating for the Philippine\ngovernment said he would meet Friday with representatives of the\ncaptors to try to win the hostages' release.\n\n\n   Sipadan itself is now sealed to the public and press, while\ninvestigators question its resort workers about the kidnapping. But\nother inlets in the vast Sulu and Celebes seas still provide\npirates ideal getaways.\n\n\n   On Sunday, six armed captors in two wooden fishing boats\nabducted the hostages and fled along this very route to similar\nislands in the southern Philippines. The victims include citizens\nof Germany, France, South Africa, Finland, Lebanon, the Philippines\nand Malaysia.\n\n\n   Malaysian police intelligence reports indicate that the\nabductors split up into smaller groups, and have been hopskotching\nfrom one island to another in a bid to avoid the hundreds of police\nswarming the area.\n\n\n   The kidnappers, apparently connected to extremist Muslim\ninsurgents in the Philippines, have demanded a $2.4 million ransom\nfor the hostages, who are being held somewhere on the islands of\nSulu province in the Philippines, officials said. So far, neither\nthe Philippines nor Malaysia has said it would negotiate a ransom.\n\n\n   This hostage-taking, along with another one month ago in which\nrebels took 27 people, has drawn wide attention to the Philippines'\nquarter-century Muslim separatist rebellion, which has taken more\nthan 120,000 lives.\n\n\n   Former rebel leader Nur Misuari, the Philippines' negotiator in\nthe crisis, urged the military Thursday not to threaten the Sipadan\nkidnappers while the talks were under way. Announcing he would meet\nwith the rebel captors Friday, Misuari said the kidnappers saw the\nhostages as a treasure, and were unlikely to release them quickly.\n\n\n   ''I think they will cling tooth and nail to these people just to\nbe able to optimize their gain,'' Misuari told reporters Thursday.\n\n\n   But military Deputy Chief of Staff Jose Calimlim said the\nmilitary had prepared a ''contingency'' action plan.\n\n\n   Soldiers have launched an attack against the Muslim extremists'\nsouthern stronghold to free the 27 hostages taken earlier.\n\n\n   But while both kidnappings have been blamed on the same group,\nthe Abu Sayyaf, Philippine officials said they may not be related.\n\n\n   Calimlim said the motive of the Malaysian kidnapping appeared to\nbe money, while the abductors in the earlier case have made\nideological demands, including the release of three Arab terrorists\njailed in the United States.\n\n\n   Also, the attack on Sipadan had been planned for nearly a month,\nindicating it was not intended to coincide with the hostage rescue\nattempt, a police report said.\n\n\n   In the meantime, local authorities have continued to search the\nwatery maze of islands for pirates and kidnappers.\n\n\n   On Mataking, at the edge of Malaysian waters off Borneo,\nfourteen Malaysian policemen armed with M-16 rifles scour the seas\nwith binoculars for passing boats traversing one of the sea\nchannels between Malaysia and the Philippines.\n\n\n   Mataking's small marine force is part of Malaysia's effort to\ncombat piracy, which has become so serious in the area that the\nLondon-based International Maritime Bureau in 1992 set up a\nregional piracy center in the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur.\n\n\n   The 25-acre island just three miles west of the international\nborder is the marine force's frontier outpost.

      "content": "AFTER CRITICISM, CHINA CRACKS DOWN ON PIRATES \n\n\n\n   SHANWEI, China _ There was no SOS signal, no storm, no sighting\nof a sinking ship. A 14,000-ton freighter just vanished into thin\nair.\n\n\n   On Nov. 16, 1998, the Cheung Son, a Hong Kong-owned cargo ship\nloaded with furnace slag, lost contact with its owners en route\nfrom Shanghai to Malaysia.\n\n\n   Two weeks later, a horrified fisherman near this southern\nChinese port pulled up his net to find a bound corpse, its mouth\ntaped shut and lashed to a 175-pound metal bar. It was the first of\n10 bodies found tangled in nets in the following weeks, all later\ndetermined to be among the 23 members of the Cheung Son's crew. The\nship itself was never seen or heard from again.\n\n\n   A long coastline, a booming and increasingly deregulated\neconomy, and powerful organized crime networks have made southern\nChina a hub for the most serious form of modern piracy: the\nhijacking of entire cargo ships, which are repainted, renamed, and\nused to troll for fresh victims at sea. With the crew disposed of\nand the ship under a new flag, the pirates advertise these ghost\nvessels as legitimate cargo carriers and then disappear with the\ncargo.\n\n\n   Since January 1999, China has cracked down, devoting hundreds of\npolice officers in dozens of cities to solving six of the most\nserious cases of modern piracy. Chinese courts have dealt harshly\nwith the perpetrators.\n\n\n   After the capture of scores of Chinese, Indonesian, Burmese, and\nFilipino suspects _ and the well-publicized execution this year of\n14 of them _ robberies in the South China Sea have nosedived, and\nmurders during high seas attacks have dropped off to nearly zero,\naccording to international figures.\n\n\n   The Chinese crackdown has begun to quiet earlier accusations\nthat Beijing was soft on crime at sea or even colluding with the\nperpetrators. The charges were leveled following a series of\nhijackings by pirates wearing Chinese law enforcement uniforms and\na case in which Chinese authorities seized a ghost ship but later\nreleased its crew.\n\n\n   One outspoken critic _ Captain Pottengal Mukundan, director of\nthe International Maritime Bureau _ now praises Chinese authorities\nfor sending ``a clear signal to these gangs that they shouldn't\nbring their cargo to China.''\n\n\n   In the only interviews granted to foreign media on the subject,\nChinese police sketched the dramatic trail that led to those\nresponsible for the disappearance of the ship Cheung Son, the most\nbrutal case of piracy in modern Chinese history.\n\n\n   On Dec. 2, 1998, the ship's owners reported that they had lost\ncontact with the ship two weeks earlier, when it was off the coast\nof Kaohsiung, Taiwan. Authorities issued an international\nall-points bulletin and called the ship's phone and fax repeatedly.\nSomeone answered, but kept hanging up.\n\n\n   Meanwhile, clubbed and bound bodies began turning up near\nShanwei, a port at nearly the same longitude as Kaohsiung. Police\nhit the docks and learned that a local man ``went to sea and came\nback with a lot of money and a dented boat,'' said Ni Baodui,\ndeputy director of the Shanwei Public Security Bureau.\n\n\n   Police combed nearby ports for suspicious craft and hit pay dirt\nin Dongshan, in the neighboring province of Fujian. Authorities\nsecretly boarded a boat and found a 30-foot-long scratch with paint\nfrom another vessel. A lab test confirmed that it matched the paint\nof the Cheung Son.\n\n\n   In early January 1999, police tracked down the owner of the\ndented boat, who was hiding in a fishing village not far from\nShanwei. He admitted he had lent his vessel to two other men and\nsaid they could be found in Shenzhen, a seedy, freewheeling area\nnext to Hong Kong.\n\n\n   Three hundred police officers raided a karaoke bar where gang\nmembers were celebrating and surrounded the two ringleaders,\ntackling one in a football-style pileup when he tried to buy a\ntrain ticket to escape.\n\n\n   The Indonesian leader of the gang told authorities he was paid\n$350,000 for the ship and cargo by his boss, an Indonesian named\nRoger who worked for a Singapore shipp",

      "content": "Shipwreck explorers' find updates lore of piracy\n\n\n\t   BOSTON (AP) _ Legend has it that ``Black Sam'' Bellamy was on\nhis way to a rendezvous with a lover when his pirate ship sank in a\nferocious storm off Cape Cod in 1717.\n\t   Since then, the wreckage of the Whydah _ and most of its\nfive-ton cargo of gold and silver _ have eluded archeologists. They\nhave found bits and pieces, but not the pirate's chief stash of\nloot.\n\t   This summer, a tantalizing underwater trail of gold coins and\nguns led researcher Barry Clifford to a perfectly preserved chunk\nof what appears to be the ship's hull.\n\t   ``We found wood and I thought, `Oh, my God!''' said Clifford,\n53. ``We got our stuff (scuba gear) on in double-time.''\n\t   Clifford said the July 19 find came on the final day of a\nthree-day expedition at a site off the coast of Wellfleet on the\neasternmost tip of the Massachusetts coastline.\n\t   After days of retrieving ancient coins and cannons, the crew was\nexhausted and close to giving up, Clifford said, when they decided\nto dig one more hole in an untouched spot in about 25 feet (8\nmeters) of water.\n\t   To their amazement, 10 feet (3 meters) below the ocean floor\nthey struck a large wooden object that seemed to be covered in tin.\n\t   Clifford said the 30-foot (9-meter) piece of wood appeared to be\na section of the Whydah's gunpowder room, covered with tin to keep\nexplosives dry.\n\t   ``When we rubbed it a bit it became very shiny,'' said Clifford,\nwho discovered the first traces of the legendary ship in 1984 about\na quarter-mile (nearly a half-kilometer) offshore.\n\t   Since then, Clifford has uncovered the ship's bell inscribed\nwith ``The Whydah Gally 1716,'' along with more than 100,000\nartifacts, including a sword-sharpening wheel, cannons, lead shot,\ntens of thousands of coins and even the remains of a pirate's leg,\nstill encased in silk stocking and a leather dress shoe.\n\t   The 280-year-old Whydah site _ the only documented wreckage of a\npirate ship _ is listed on the National Register of Historic\nPlaces.\n\t   Last year, archeologists off the coast of North Carolina\ndiscovered what they believe is a portion of Queen Anne's Revenge,\nflagship of the fabled pirate Blackbeard. But that find has not\nbeen historically authenticated.\n\t   Artifacts are continually being salvaged from the Whydah, but\nnever had explorers pinpointed such a large and intact piece of the\nship's skeleton, Clifford said.\n\t   They hope the hull section will unlock the location of the\nmother lode of Bellamy's treasure _ gold and silver believed\nplundered from more than 50 other ships, said Clifford.\n\t   The discovery adds a chapter in the saga of Samuel ``Black Sam''\nBellamy, a 28-year-old English swashbuckler who epitomized the era\nchronicled in Daniel Defoe's ``The History of the Pirates,'' when\nbands of rebellious sailors roamed the seas.\n\t   The Whydah, a 100-foot-long (30-meter-long), three-masted\ngalley, was named after the African ``widow bird'' and seaport of\nthe same name.\n\t   The ship was captured by Bellamy and his crew in 1716 as it\nheaded back to England from its maiden voyage to the Caribbean to\nsell African slaves.\n\t   Legend has it that Bellamy turned the ship toward Cape Cod to\nmeet with his love, a local girl named Maria Hallet. But a deadly\nstorm pummeled the Whydah, and Black Sam was never seen again.\n\t   The Whydah explorers, sponsored by the National Geographic\nSociety, have spent much of the past 14 summers searching for the\nprobable burial ground of the one-time slave ship.\n\t   Using underwater cameras and other high-tech tools, Clifford and\nhis crew painstakingly charted wreckage discoveries and traced\npatterns left by tiny grains of gold.\n\t   ``It's like Hansel and Gretel, but rather than following bread\ncrumbs, we're following a trail of gold dust,'' said Clifford.\n``We've been looking for the wooden hull of a ship which doesn't\ngive off a huge magnetic hit like a cannon would.''\n\t   The history of piracy in the late 1600s and early 1700s has been\nsimplified by filmmakers and some historians, and Clifford believes\nfinds like his ca",

In\nSoutheast Asia, where the piracy rates are alarming, the calls for\nhelp are often rooted in desperation. Bear in mind that this is an\nindustry dealing with goods that are ridiculously easy to\nreproduce.\n\t   There are many ways to get the undivided attention of the\nauthorities and the public. Recently, the Business Software\nAlliance (BSA) announced the findings of a study to show people\nwhat is in it for them if piracy is lowered.\n\t   Conducted by Price Waterhouse (PW), the research shows how the\npackaged software industry contributes to the economies of\nIndonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and\nVietnam.\n\t   Packaged software covers business applications and leisure\nprograms.\n\t   Examples of business software are operating systems, word\nprocessors, spreadsheets, graphics, database management,\ncomputer-aided design and computer-aided engineering products, and\nnetworking software. Leisure programs include games, entertainment\nand educational software. The study excludes customised software.\n\t   Piracy is defined as `unauthorised copying and distribution of\ncopyrighted software products'.\n\t   The BSA-PW report on the study offers persuasive arguments as to\nwhy everybody (except maybe, the pirates) are better off without\nsoftware piracy, described as a `major drag' on the industry's\ngrowth. Using 1996 figures, the report argues that the industry is\nsignificant in terms of jobs and the government revenue it has\ncreated. This is followed with projected corresponding figures\nuntil the year 2001. The final part discusses the impact of piracy\nand how it would be if the piracy rate was lower.\n\t   According to the report, the Malaysian packaged software\nindustry accounted for US$298 million (US$1 &QC; RM3.80) in sales and\nUS$544.5 million in\ntotal economic activity in 1996. That year, it provided 3,656 jobs\nin software and supporting industries, and generated US$78.5\nmillion in direct and indirect taxes.\t   Between 1996 and 2001, the industry is expected to grow at an\naverage annual rate of 17.4 per cent, resulting in sales of\nUS$664.6 million and stimulating US$1.2 billion in economic\nactivity by 2001. These sales will create 5,548 jobs. The\ngovernment is projected to collect US$175 million from this\nexpansion.\n\t   What happens if the Malaysian piracy rate - 80 per cent in 1996\n-falls to the current US rate of 27 per cent? This leads to the\nmost compelling and interesting segment of the study.\n\t   (The folks at BSA will tell you that the only acceptable piracy\nrate is zero per cent, but PW picks the US rate as a realistic and\npractical point of reference.) If Malaysia's piracy rate in 1996\nwas 27 per cent instead of 80, there would have been an additional\n4,007 jobs and the government would have been richer by US$86\nmillion. By the year 2001, the packaged software industry could\naccount for 11,628 jobs and US$366.8 million in tax revenues.\n\t   Says the report, `In sum, software piracy harms the Malaysian\neconomy, curtails economic growth, constrains employment and limits\ntax contributions to the government.'",

Instead, as\nvice-president of American publishing software maker Adobe Systems\nInc, he was in Malaysia attending to business, which included\nspreading the anti-piracy gospel.\n\t   That day, he was at a function held to announce key findings of\na study on the Southeast Asian software industry. `I have incurred\nthe wrath of my wife by putting off the celebration to be here in\nKL. Looks like I'll have to make it up with a more expensive dinner\nand all that,' he says.\n\t   His remark on the price of placing work before domestic demands\nwas, of course, Freeman's way of injecting a little levity into a\nsombre event.\n\t   But he was dead serious when talking about the cost of software\npiracy. 'I believe if the Southeast Asian piracy rate was equal to\nthat of the United States, Adobe's income (in the region) would be\nthree to four times what it is now,' he complains.\n\t   According to estimates by international industry watchdog\nBusiness Software Alliance (BSA), the software piracy rates of\ncountries in this region are among the highest in the world. In\n1996, 84 per cent of the PC business software used or sold in\nSoutheast Asia comprised unauthorised copies with a market value of\nalmost US$600 million (US$1 &QC; RM3.80).\n\t   Malaysia's rate was 80 per cent (See Table 1). In comparison,\nthe US piracy level is currently 27 per cent. (Adobe Systems is a\nBSA member, as are other big players such as Autodesk Inc, Bentley\nSystems Inc, Lotus Development Corporation, Microsoft Corporation,\nNovell Inc and Symantec Corporation.) BSA commissioned Price\nWaterhouse to research the contribution of the packaged software\nindustry to the Southeast Asian economies. The exercise was\ncompleted last December.\n\t   BSA president Robert Holleyman singled out two conclusions. One,\nthe industry is significant - more than previously thought -\nthroughout the region in terms of jobs and revenue created. And\ntwo, it will become even more significant as governments step up\nanti-piracy enforcement.\n\t   Piracy is without doubt a pivotal issue in the Malaysian\nsoftware business (as it is in the rest of the region). One cannot\ndiscuss the industry without mentioning the `P' word.\n\t   To a significant extent, the success of the Multimedia Super\nCorridor (MSC) project rests upon adequate intellectual property\n(IP) protection.\n\t   This is precisely why the government has pledged to become `a\nregional leader in IP protection and cyberlaws'.\n\t   Part of the grand design is to make the MSC a development hub\nand export centre for software. The idea is to nurture over the\nnext 10 years a crop of local software makers who can compete\nregionally, if not globally.\n\t   To do this, it is important to enlist the help of the foreign\nsoftware titans. Microsoft instantly comes to mind. While in\nMalaysia last March, its chairman and CEO, Bill Gates, re-affirmed\nhis company's support for the MSC but gave scant details. In a New\nStraits Times interview, he had this to say about software piracy,\n`You never win the battle. It's an important issue but it's an\nissue where the trend is definitely positive.\n\t   There have been good steps taken in Malaysia but I certainly\nwouldn't say that we can relax.' Gates' top guy in Malaysia,\nMicrosoft (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd general manager Benedict Lee, expands\non the theme. `If you understand the government's drive to\ntransform the economy from an industrial one to one based on\ninformation, then you understand that we need to build a new\nsociety that can create software.\n\t   `But if piracy is prevalent, how are we going to attract our\nyounger generation into software development? They will think there\nis no revenue in it at all.' There are many others observing\nclosely Malaysia's war against the IP thieves. In its 1998 Foreign\nTrade Barriers Report released in April, the US Trade\nRepresentative touched on CD-based digital piracy. While praising\nthe Malaysian authorities' crackdown, the report points out some\nweak spots.\n\t   `Nevertheless, the presence and frequency of pirated videotapes\nand computer",

He said\nHong Kong has some of the best laws protecting copyright on the\nInternet.\n\t   Authorities in Hong Kong and other territories in the region are\nunder pressure, particularly from the United States, to do a better\njob of protecting intellectual property. U.S. officials say Hong\nKong has become a production center as well as a distribution\ncenter since officials in mainland China began cracking down.\n\t   U.S. officials last month decided to keep Hong Kong on a\nwatchlist for copyright violation.\n\t   Hong Kong last year passed what officials said is one of the\ntoughest anti-pirating laws in the world. Customs officials also\nhave staged several high-profile raids.\n\t   In April, officers of Hong Kong's anti-corruption agency seized\n7 million pirated video CDs and production equipment worth 650\nmillion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 83 million) in the biggest\nsuch seizure in Hong Kong's history.\n\t   Despite the government's efforts to crack down on piracy, no\nless than 100 shops across the territory still openly sell pirated\nvideo or music CDs and computer software in shopping malls or on\nthe street.\n\t   These shops sell recently released movies or music discs for\nabout 35 Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 4.50) each. Popular software,\nincluding the soon-to-be-released Windows 98, are sold for a\nfraction of the price of a legitimate copy.\n\t   Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa, speaking at the same conference,\nsaid the government is committed to cracking down on piracy, but\nHong Kong ``is a telecommunications center and a leading center for\nfilm and television production. The demand for cheap pirated\noptical discs is considerable and this provides the incentive for\npiracy or counterfeiting.''",
