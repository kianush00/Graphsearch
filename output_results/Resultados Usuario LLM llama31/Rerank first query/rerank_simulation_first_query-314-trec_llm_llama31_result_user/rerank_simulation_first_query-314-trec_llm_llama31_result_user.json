      "content": "THE GRILL OF YOUR DREAMS\n\n\n\n   With today's penchant for outdoor living, creating a luxurious\ncontemporary patio and back yard and investing in a fabulous custom\nbuilt-in barbecue _ an extension of the great room _ is one of the\nhottest trends.\n\n\n   But you don't have to have a lavish setting or a fancy grill to\nenjoy wonderful succulent foods cooked outdoors. A simple charcoal\nor gas grill _ or even a hibachi _ will do.\n\n\n   Grilling is still the all-American pastime. Seventy-five percent\nof U.S. households own and use a barbecue grill _ and more than 60\npercent of gas grill owners cook out several times a week\nyear-round, according to the Barbecue Industry Association.\n\n\n   ``Grilling is so easy and tasty, it's no wonder it is one of\nAmerica's favorite outdoor pastimes,'' says Kristi Fuller, editor\nof ``Better Homes and Gardens The New Grilling Book'' (Meredith\nBooks; $29.95). The down-to-earth volume covers all the basics _\nincluding information on regional preferences, starting a fire,\nheat control, timing tips, food safety, grilling gadgets and how to\nselect a grill. You'll also find a grilling glossary along with\ngrilling charts and tips sprinkled throughout the 372 pages, which\nfeature more than 500 recipes.\n\n\n   Taste was the primary focus, although simplicity and ease of\npreparation _ along with straightforward ingredients readily\navailable in supermarkets _ were also considerations in recipes,\nFuller says. All include prep and cooking times, as well as\nnutritional information.\n\n\n   Recipes run the gamut from condiments, appetizers, sides and\ndesserts to beef, veal, lamb, pork, chicken, turkey, fish,\nshellfish, game and fowl. A separate chapter covers smoke cooking\nwith recipes like Pecan-Smoked Pork Chops, Texas Beer-Smoked Ribs\nand Double-Smoked Salmon With Horseradish Cream.\n\n\n   When it comes to smoke cooking, Fuller favors an electric smoker\nbecause it's the most reliable. However, she suggests getting\nacquainted with the smoking process on a simple scale by using a\ncharcoal or gas grill before investing in other equipment such as a\nvertical water smoker or a horizontal dry smoker.\n\n\n   Cooking on gas or charcoal grills is done by one of two cooking\nmethods _ direct or indirect heat. Direct grilling _ where foods\nare placed directly over the heat source (and should be turned\nhalfway through the cooking time) _ is similar to broiling and\nbest-suited to foods that are tender, small or thin and cook\nquickly in less than 25 minutes. That includes burgers, steaks,\nkabobs, chops, hot dogs, boneless poultry, fish and most\nvegetables.\n\n\n   Direct grilling can be done with the lid up or down, but when\nthe cover is closed, the grill begins to simulate an oven. You can\ncook larger items such as roasts or bone-in poultry more slowly\nthis way and impart a smoky flavor.\n\n\n   When food is cooked by indirect heat, it is placed adjacent to,\nrather than directly over the coals _ and the cover is down. This\nmethod is used for large cuts of meat, ribs, whole fish and birds,\nand other foods that require longer, slower cooking.\n\n\n   When starting a charcoal grill, figure on mounding and igniting\nabout 30 briquettes per pound of meat to be cooked with the lid up.\nSince it'll take about 20 to 30 minutes for the coals to turn ash\ngray, start the grill 30 minutes before you're planning to grill\nthe food. Begin preheating a gas grill 10 to 15 minutes prior to\ncooking.\n\n\n   A key to successful grilling is determining the point when the\ncharcoal or gas will have attained the ideal temperature for\ncooking the food.\n\n\n   ``Too-high heat can char and dry out the food, while too-low can\ndefeat the quick-cooking benefit of grilling,'' says Fuller.\n\n\n   You can judge the approximate temperature of the coals by how\nlong you can hold your hand above the coals at the cooking level\n(of the food). If you can hold your hand comfortably over the coals\nfor only two seconds, figure that the fire is hot and the\ntemperature will be around 400 to 450 degrees F. Coals should\nappear barely covered with gray ash and be burning when done. A\nmedium fire e",

At first, there were\npractical reasons: Tough meat needed to be made tender, it needed\nto be preserved, and, with humans ever attuned to improving their\nlot, it needed to be flavored. But from ranch to refrigerator,\nalmost everything has changed about meat and the way it is treated\ntoday. Everything, that is, except marination.

For many years,\nAmericans have confounded the rest of the world by drinking their\nwhite wines too cold and their red wines too warm. Sommeliers no\nlonger hesitate when diners ask that a luscious Corton-Charlemagne\nbe plunged into an ice bucket. They just do it. It's easy. Red wine\nposes a different problem. If it arrives at the table with slight\nchill, and the diners want it the temperature of a blood\ntransfusion _ fast _ the sommelier must resort to wiles, and the\nwiliest wile of all, it turns out, is the microwave oven.

We have\nbetter ovens that bake with more even heat. The freshness and\nquality of produce and meats have improved. We can buy more\nvarieties of meats and vegetables that benefit from different\ncooking techniques. Plus we have less time to experiment in the\nkitchen to find out what works and what doesn't.\n\n\n   In ``Best Way,'' the Food staff will examine preparation\npresumptions and try to establish the most reliable way to cook\nmany of our favorite foods.\n\n\n   Today we tackle the ultimate comfort food _ baked potatoes.\nAfter testing, tasting and retesting we tried 16 variations before\ncoming up with the winner.\n\n\n   We also developed a citrus marinade for chicken and pork to\ndetermine the optimum time the meat should marinate and whether the\nmarinade should contain salt.

We even tried the microwave.\n\n\n   In our series of taste tests, the Food staff agreed potatoes are\nbest when cooked in a 350-degree oven for 11/2 hours. Potatoes\nbaked at higher temperatures for less time had limp skins and dense\nflesh.\n\n\n   The most varied results, however, came from slight changes in\nthe cooking method.\n\n\n   The potatoes cooked in foil were a disaster _ they tasted more\nsteamed than baked. The skin was limp and chewy, the flesh dense\nand overly-moist.\n\n\n   Rubbing the potato with oil produced a similar steamed effect,\nbut the flavor was better.\n\n\n   And when microwaved, the potato turned into a shriveled, mushy\nmess.\n\n\n   &QL; \n &UR; THE BEST WAY &LR;\n\n\n   The plain potato, pierced with a fork to let steam escape,\nproduced the best results.

Between them are curious-looking dollops\nof a light green substance that is identified to me as the aioli\nand further defined as mayonnaise flavored with crushed garlic;\ninfused, I am certain.\n\n\n   The rest of the entree has this hockey puck-looking disk of\nbeans glued together by the vegetable marmalade.\n\n\n   It is then that my wife and I fondly begin discussing the dinner\nwe had a couple of nights earlier in South Carolina _ a tangy,\nfilling platter of Memphis-style ribs, baked potato and salad. Note\nthat each and all of these ingredients are identifiable to the\naverage American.\n\n\n   It would seem that in these recent decades of chi-chi American\ngastronomy, presumably foisted upon us by California chefs run\namok, there are becoming just two types of restaurant dining: fast\nfood and no food. What's in-between is fading from the restaurant\nplatter.\n\n\n   Try going to one of those restaurants where the kitchen is out\nin the open, the chefs considered to be celebrities, and try to get\nsome meatloaf. Fat chance!\n\n\n   I left the restaurant for my room, still hungry and longing for\nthat jar of peanuts on my nightstand and a cold Dr Pepper.\n\n\n   The experience of enigmatic and paltry main courses reminded me\nof a column written by a now-gone colleague who tired of the trend\nto fantasy-style dining. He showed up at a 7-Eleven one night, and\nforaged the food cabinets of the establishment. ``First, I munched\non an adventurous pemmican appetizer called a Super Jerk Slim\nJim,'' John Keasler wrote. ``It sent my taste buds right into happy\nlittle aerobics!\n\n\n   ``The main course,'' he continued, ``is prepared by a system of\nmicro (or little-ditty) waves. My companion was overjoyed with her\nRed Hot Beef and Bean Burro, an astounding bargain at 79 cents,\nwhile I literally drooled over my Shredded Beef Chimichanga With\nGreen Chili and Cheese in a Fried Flour Tortilla, at the same\nprice.''\n\n\n   So, that seems to be our choice: aioli, chocolate-infused\nespresso-crusted something, goat cheese-chive mash on one side and\nribs, hamburgers and a plain old steak or fried catfish on the\nother.\n\n\n   No one ever had to explain a menu to me at Denny's, or even\nShoney's.\n\n\n   But that's what's so great about this country, eh?; the choice.\n\n\n   (Howard Kleinberg, a former editor of the Miami News, is a\ncolumnist for Cox Newspapers.

      "content": "COMMUNITY CARDEN HELPS FEED RESERVATION RESIDENTS \n\n\n\n   ETHETE, Wyo. _ In the face of cutbacks brought about by the\noverhaul of welfare programs, members of the Northern Arapaho Tribe\non the Wind River Reservation have started a seven-acre community\ngarden with donated land, seeds and equipment to grow vegetables\nfor themselves and for the elderly and disabled who cannot work.\n\n\n   ``We were concerned that when time runs out, when they are no\nlonger eligible for government assistance, what are they going to\ndo for food?'' said Glen Revere, a nutritionist with the Indian\nHealth Services on the 2.8 million-acre Wind River Reservation,\nabout 100 miles east of Jackson, Wyo. ``Then we came up with the\nidea for this community garden, and it's been bigger than we ever\nexpected in so many ways.''\n\n\n   At the all-volunteer garden, this is the time of year when\npotatoes grow larger than a man's fist, popping out of the soil,\nand five-foot-high cornstalks develop ears with red, yellow and\nwhite kernels ripening inside. The conditions on these wide plains\nnear the Wind River Range of the Rocky Mountains can be harsh, with\nhigh winds, late springs and early autumns limit the growing season\nto 90 days.\n\n\n   Revere's partner in this effort is Irene Houser, director of the\nNorthern Arapaho Tribe Community Services, who has distributed\nproduce around the Wind River Reservation and to the Pine Ridge\nReservation in southwestern South Dakota.\n\n\n   Ms. Houser, a member of the Northern Arapaho Tribe, said people\nwere stunned when she brought them bushels of potatoes, onions,\nsquash, zucchini, tomatoes, beets, radishes and other vegetables.\n\n\n   ``They asked, `How much are you going to charge me for this?'''\nshe recalled. ``I said, `It's free,' and they were so happy. Many\nof them didn't have food in their house when I showed up.''\n\n\n   Mark Soldierwolf, a 70-year-old father of nine and grandfather\nof nine, said: ``That food lasted us about six weeks. We dried some\nthings, boiled some. Just ate all of it.''\n\n\n   Soldierwolf, a Northern Arapaho who served with the Marines in\nWorld War II and the Korean War, lives with his wife, Florita, one\ndaughter and one grandchild. They receive food stamps for a\n$300-a-month budget for the four of them, but they said they often\nfed members of their family who stopped by. Soldierwolf estimated\nthey saved $70 with the free vegetables.\n\n\n   Soldierwolf's family represents the problems that plague many of\nthe 1.3 million American Indians who live on reservations, of whom\n49 percent are unemployed. The Bureau of Indian Affairs estimates\nthat at least half the American Indian population lives in poverty.\nSoldierwolf said all but one of his adult children were unemployed.\n\n\n   ``If you can make it to the end of the month, you're all\nright,'' Soldierwolf said, referring to the monthly food stamps.\n``It's worse than in the Depression.'' Mrs. Soldierwolf nodded,\nwith tears in her eyes.\n\n\n   The Wyoming Department of Family Services says the Northern\nArapaho on the reservation account for 18.9 percent of all welfare\ncases in Wyoming. The reservation population of 12,000 _ including\n6,000 Northern Arapaho tribal members, about 3,000 Shoshone tribal\nmembers and 3,000 from other tribes _ represents about 2.5 percent\nof the state's population of 480,000.\n\n\n   Revere and Ms. Houser say the community garden can help reduce\ndependence on welfare by enabling residents to produce cash crops,\ntraditional Indian plants to be sold on or off the reservation.\n\n\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\n\n\n   On the Crow Reservation in Montana, at a five-acre garden to be\nplanted this fall, the plan is to let people's work part at the\ngarden count toward fulfillment of their welfare community service\nrequirement.\n\n\n   ``We are trying to provide people with skills that they can use\nhere or take with them,'' said Charlene Johnson, a Crow tribal\nmember and nutritionist with Indian Health Services. ``Indians are\nnot horticulturists.

It\ntakes a sharp eye to pick out, on the left, the silver diner with\nthe small rooftop sign: Chez Sophie Bistro.\n\n\n   The motorist who whizzes by in the afternoon is entitled to feel\na twinge of pity. That empty parking lot. That lonely diner. And\njust think of the misguided idealists who thought they could sell\nFrench food out in the wilderness.\n\n\n   But as dusk approaches, car after car takes a sharp left turn\ninto Sophie's. By 7, the lot is full, and so is the restaurant.\n\n\n   What they have found is a tiny bit of France 3,500 miles from\nParis, the neighborhood bistro that every New Yorker dreams of _\nlocated, unfortunately, in a neighborhood that takes three and a\nhalf hours to reach by car.\n\n\n   Chez Sophie is worth the drive. For nearly 30 years, it has been\nserving classic bistro dishes, the kind of deceptively simple food\nthat, for the French, makes life worth living.\n\n\n   In that time, the menu, printed on a mimeographed sheet of\npaper, has scarcely budged. The customers won't let it. They want\nthe caneton a la Sophie, tender slices of duck breast in a sweetly\npiquant apricot and green pepper sauce. They demand the veal\nscallops in a cream and lemon sauce.\n\n\n   Up and down the Hudson, innkeepers and new-wave restaurateurs\nhave made giant strides raising the region's culinary standards\nover the past decade. But Chez Sophie has been there all along,\nwith a single cook in the kitchen turning out one flawless dish\nafter another.\n\n\n   Yes, there is a Sophie. She is French, despite her all-American\nlast name (Parker), and six nights a week she serves 40 to 50 meals\nto customers who, in many cases, have eaten at the restaurant more\nthan 100 times. At the age of 73, she rules over a kitchen staff of\nprecisely two, not counting the dishwashers.\n\n\n   Her husband, Joseph, takes reservations, greets and seats and\nkeeps the diners happy. Her son, Paul, waits on tables and buys the\nfood and wine.\n\n\n   Bill and Kimberley Comiskey from nearby Malta eat at Sophie's\nevery Friday night, in the same booth. They have done so ever since\nthe restaurant moved to the diner about three years ago. That adds\nup to more than 150 meals, but the actual total runs much higher,\nbecause they come with friends on other nights and celebrate at\nSophie's on special occasions.\n\n\n   ``This is the place we compare others to,'' said Ms. Comiskey,\nwho operates a day spa in Latham. ``It's our benchmark.''\n\n\n   Mrs. Parker herself makes very limited claims for the place.\n\n\n   ``I do very simple things, actually,'' she said, seated at a\nfront booth in her chef whites early one afternoon, before the\nday's cooking got under way. ``I don't even think of it as French,\nreally, I just think of it as good food.''\n\n\n   In a way, the modesty is understandable. Chez Sophie cruises\nalong with a set menu of seven appetizers, eight main courses (plus\na fish and pasta of the day), and seven desserts. The wine list\nfits on two sides of a piece of typewriter paper: 39 whites on one\nside, 38 reds on the other.\n\n\n   There's a nice list of Belgian beers. The appetizers are priced\nfrom $4.50 to $10, the entrees from $21 to $29.\n\n\n   The offerings are pre-nouvelle: country pate, escargots in\nbutter and garlic, roasted poussin, steak with peppercorn sauce,\nchocolate mousse. There are a few contemporary touches, like a veal\nchop roasted with portobello and shiitake mushrooms, and quail in a\ncurrant sauce enlivened with balsamic vinegar, but that's as wild\nas things get.\n\n\n   Within tight, traditional limits, however, Chez Sophie makes\ngood on the promise implicit in the name ``bistro.'' The\ningredients are fresh, the flavors pristine, the presentation\nunfussy. The thinkin",

      "content": "&HT;   \n\n\n\n   Have you ever contemplated onions? Probably not. They hang\nhumbly in their little mesh sacks in probably every kitchen on\nearth, and nobody ever pays them much attention or ever considers\nwhere we would be without them. Yet the lack of an onion at a\ncrucial time can send you out to hunt one up more quickly than just\nabout anything, so necessary are they to our palates. The pale,\nunassuming onion: always in the background, perpetually playing a\nsupporting role, allowing flashier foods to shine and dazzle.\n\n\n   Onions weren't always taken so much for granted. When the world\nwas younger and people had a lot less to distract them, folks\nflat-out marveled at the onion, which was one of the first\nvegetables that humans cultivated for food after it emerged from\nthe primordial ooze. With its translucent layers and spheres within\nspheres, the onion took on religious significance. The Egyptians\nbelieved them nothing less than a symbol of eternity and took their\nsacred oaths on onions.\n\n\n   The Byzantine domes that are part of the architecture of\nreligious structures the world over? Onions.\n\n\n   Their value became more secular during the Middle Ages, when you\ncould pay off your debts with a sack of onions. During the Civil\nWar, Gen. Ulysses S. Grant informed the War Department, ``I will\nnot move my army without onions.'' Three trainloads were delivered\nto the front the next day.\n\n\n   Civilization has long since stopped marveling at onions, but\nonce a year we do get a chance to give them a bit of well-deserved\nattention. This is onion season, when growers in places such as\nWashington state, Idaho, Oregon, Hawaii, South Texas and, of\ncourse, South Georgia begin tooting their horns about their crop\nand everyone becomes a little more aware of the humble bulb.\n\n\n   Now's a good time to renew our appreciation for the onion, and\nabout 10 minutes on the Internet allows you to pay proper homage.\n\n\n   &QR;  To hold your own in any conversation about onions, see\nwww.bpe.com/food/columns\n\n\n   /ferrayfiszer/onions.htm for a good, readable overview of the\ndifferent types, where they are grown, what makes them sweet or\nnot, why they make you cry and a little history.\n\n\n   &QR;  Another very well-done site is maintained by the National\nOnion Association. Go to www\n\n\n   .onions-usa.org/ for health and nutritional information, trivia,\ntrends and some great recipes.\n\n\n   &QR;  With all the emphasis on the ancient religious significance of\nonions, we forgot to mention that they were once considered a\npowerful aphrodisiac.

After all, this was his first trip to\nthe United States and he had only seen the John F. Kennedy Airport,\ndowntown Schenectady and points in between.\n\n\n   A native of the East African nation of Tanzania, now with the\nGoteborg University in Sweden, Mlima was one of more than 200 of\nthe world's top economists attending the North American\nProductivity Workshop, held recently at Union College. The opening\nbanquet of the three-day seminar, as Mlima would learn somewhere\nbetween the hors d'oeuvres and first entree course, was not\nAmerican food, but authentic Thai cuisine.\n\n\n   Providing a six-course, 13-dish Asian repast as the opening\nmeal, was one of many ways organizers at the small private college\nmade a bookish seminar and trip to Schenectady attractive to the\nattendees from all parts of the globe.\n\n\n   Suthathip (Lek) Yaisawarng, chairwoman of the college's\ndepartment of economics, co-chair of the event and a native of\nBangkok, spent hours with the school's dining services staff\nteaching the finer points of cooking with ingredients such as black\nfungus (mushrooms) and makrood (kaffir lime leaves).\n\n\n   ``I liked to cook when I was child,'' said Yaisawarng, standing\nin the giant white tent erected for the feast in front of the Nott\nMemorial on the Union campus. ``I didn't know that I'd need to come\nback to it, and in such quantities!''\n\n\n   But early in the evening, dinner was proving to be a highlight\nof the workshop.\n\n\n   As a group of Union professors played Dixieland jazz, attendees\njuggled glasses of wine or bottles of beer and jostled each other\nfor plates of fish cakes with cucumber sauce. They conversed in\nEnglish, but the language came with a variety of heavy accents,\nincluding German, French, Australian, Arab, and even Southern. The\ndelegates hailed from at least 30 countries, including New Zealand,\nBangladesh, Hungary, Belgium and Japan.\n\n\n   Cocktail hour was followed by a soup course, which, though\nplenty spicy for some, was tame by Nostratollah Nafar's standards.\nNafar, a professor at Allameh Tabatabai University in Tehran, Iran,\nadded ground chili peppers by the tablespoon to his bowl.\n\n\n   More familiar with both Asian and American cuisine than Mlima,\nNafar explained, ``Chinese food not hot, it's sweet.''\n\n\n   It is important that people eat together, meet socially and form\npersonal relationships at events like this so when they get into a\nsession, they are more likely to open up and make the conference\nmore productive, said Yaisawarng.\n\n\n   If Mlima was disappointed to not be dining on New York strip\nsteaks and New England clam chowder at his first major feast in\nAmerica, it didn't last long.\n\n\n   As the servers brought bowls of lime sorbet between entree\ncourses, Nafar exclaimed, ``Here's American food _ ice cream!''\n\n\n   ___\n\n\n   THAI SPRING ROLL WITH SWEET AND SOUR SAUCE\n\n\n   2 tablespoons vegetable oil\n\n\n   3 cloves freshly chopped garlic\n\n\n   1 cup very lean ground pork\n\n\n   3 cups julienned carrot\n\n\n   2 packages cellophane noodles\n\n\n   2 ounces dried Chinese black mushrooms\n\n\n   1/2 cup chopped green onion\n\n\n   1/2 teaspoon black pepper\n\n\n   2 tablespoons Thai soy sauce\n\n\n   1 pack spring roll wrappers\n\n\n   2 tablespoons cornstarch mixed with 2 tablespoons water\n\n\n   Vegetable oil for deep frying\n\n\n   2 cups spicy sweet and sour sauce\n\n\n   1 cup vinegar\n\n\n   1/2 cup water\n\n\n   1/3 cup fresh cilantro leaves\n\n\n   Heat 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in frying pan.

      "content": "SALSA: There are plenty of flavor and texture options here, so\npick a couple of bottled favorites to keep handy in the pantry. If\nyou plan to use them within a week or two, you might want to\npurchased the refrigerated salsas, which are fresher tasting but\nnot as convenient. Salsas of all varieties (tomato, pineapple,\nmango and the like) lend themselves to adding Tex-Mex and other\nflavors to skillet creations, dips, rice, cold bean and corn\nsalads, salad dressings and more. Also use salsa to top grilled\nchicken breasts, steaks and the like. And of course, it's a great\ndip with chips when you have nothing else on hand.\n\n\n   FROZEN VEGETABLES: Keep a supply of lots of different single\nvegetables as well as combinations to use in salads, soups,\nstir-fries and more. Some favorites include corn for chowder, sugar\nsnap peas and various combinations for stir-fries, assorted strips\nof red, green and yellow peppers, baby peas and haricots verts. I\nlike the quality of some of the Trader Joe's offerings.\n\n\n   FROZEN FRUITS: Lots of possibilities are available including\npineapple, raspberries, strawberries, mango, melons and assorted\nfruits to make into quick fruit salads or compotes (serve topped\nwith cottage cheese for a light dinner during summer), cobblers or\npies. Single fruits or combinations are also great whirred into\nsmoothies for breakfast or a snack or pureed for sauces for ice\ncream, cake or waffles. Try processing frozen raspberries with tofu\nin a food processor for a quick frozen dessert.\n\n\n   SHREDDED CHEESES: Keep several kinds (flavor- and fat-wise) _\nincluding some of the blends _ ready to add to tostadas, lasagna,\ncasseroles, salads, pizzas, sandwiches or English muffins. The\nlarger the bag, the bigger the price break. Once opened, these\ncheeses have a tendency to lose freshness faster than a large block\nof cheese.\n\n\n   ROASTED RED PEPPERS: Available in jars (Mezzetta brand is my\npreference), these are wonderful for those in a hurry. Rinse and\ndrain them, then puree in a food processor for sauces or dips or\ncut them up and toss in soups, salads, sandwiches and main dishes.\nAlso try marinating pieces in oil, vinegar and a little garlic and\nserve as part of an Italian antipasto platter. Once you get in the\nhabit of using the bottled, you may never go back to roasting your\nown.\n\n\n   CANNED GREEN CHILES: Available whole or diced, these give a\nflavor boost to dips, quesadillas, rice, chiles rellenos, sauces,\nchili, pizzas, entrees of all kinds and more. Whenever I whip up a\ncrustless quiche for brunch or dinner, I pour beaten eggs mixed\nwith a little milk or cream and seasoned with chiles and seasoned\nsalt and garlic pepper over plenty of shredded cheese in a pie\nplate. Bake until set and you're in for some tasty dining.\n\n\n   CANNED AND BOTTLED OLIVES: I keep all colors and flavors of\npitted olives handy for tapenades (made in no time flat in the food\nprocessor) as well as to embellish casseroles and, particularly,\nsalads and pasta dishes. The tapenades can be mixed with cream\ncheese for a dip, spread on rustic bread slices to accompany soups\nand more.\n\n\n   ARTICHOKE HEARTS: I prefer the canned to frozen (which I find\nwatery and flavorless). Buy quartered and rinse and drain well (I\nadd a sprinkling of red wine vinegar and drain well to get rid of\nthe canned taste) before adding to cold marinated vegetable or\npasta salads. Also great in baked artichoke cheese dip. You'll find\nmany ways to use them.\n\n\n   PACKAGED ROASTED REFRIGERATED CHICKEN BREASTS: What a fabulous\nand convenient shortcut. To save money, I purchase these at a\nwarehouse store (Tyson brand) where they are in the neighborhood of\n$10-$12 per package of 6 or so breasts. Remove the skin and bones\nand slice, chop or cut in strips to use in the full gamut of dishes\nfrom soups and salads to entrees. Keep some frozen to thaw on a\ndime when you don't have any other protein on hand to help solve\nthe dinner dilemma.\n\n\n   ASSORTED MUSTARDS: I've been hooked on a large variety _\nincluding Dijon, honey mustard, grainy, hot and prepared yellow\nmustards _ for ye",

They suit today's lifestyles\nbecause they're usually easy to make and don't require cooking\nexpertise. They're perfect for little meals or finger-food snacks\nwith drinks. Tapas (pronounced TOP-ahs), translated ``lids on\ntop,'' are appetizers _ the Spanish equivalent of French hors\nd'oeuvres and Mexican bocas (short for ``bocados,'' meaning\nmouthfuls or bites).\n\n\n   It's the second time around for tapas. Although some Houston\nrestaurants have offered tapas for about 20 years, they enjoyed a\nbrief fad in the '80s, then faded.\n\n\n   Tapas went the way of fondue and crepes until the '90s, when\nrestaurants introduced Houstonians to South American-style tidbits.\n\n\n   Restaurants concerned with authenticity have an education job on\ntheir hands. Some classic Spanish ingredients are an acquired\ntaste, particularly smelt, salt cod, baby eel (angula), squid\n(calamare), snails, octopus, baby anchovies (boquerones), chorizo\nsausage, blood sausage (morcilla) and salty-cured Serrano ham.\n\n\n   Shrimp, mussels, a variety of olives, bowls of almonds, fresh\npimentos and Spanish Tortilla (potato omelet) receive more instant\nacceptance.\n\n\n   Penelope Casas has written several books on Spain. In her books,\nshe offers a wealth of tips on tapas, including the following:\n\n\n   Choose a variety of tapas _ vegetables, meats, seafood. Prepare\none or several from each category: fried, baked or grilled; cold or\nmarinated; in sauces; or with bread or pastries.\n\n\n   For a large group, choose finger foods or serve tapas on\ntoothpicks. Make 10 to 20 different tapa varieties and set them out\nbuffet-style.\n\n\n   Tapas that need last-minute preparation and should be eaten\nimmediately, should be spaced over the course of the evening and\npassed on trays.\n\n\n   For a small gathering, start with lighter tapas, such as\nrice-filled pimentos or seafood-stuffed mushrooms, and progress to\nmore filling tapas.\n\n\n   Serve tapas with sherry (well-chilled fino sherry is\ntraditional), especially if tapas are spicy or salty. Serve with\nthe appropriate white or red wine, beer or sangria.\n\n\n   Among popular tapas with drinks are croquettes (made with\npotatoes or seafood), grilled vegetables with garlic sauce,\nPotatoes Bravas (spicy potatoes), cheese (Mi Luna offers a platter\nwith goat cheese, Brie and manchego tossed in olive oil that has\nbeen infused with peppercorns, chervil and lemon), marinated olives\nand mushrooms. &QL; \n &QL; \nXXXXXEND OF STORY &QL;",

      "content": "`BAREFOOT CONTESSA COOKBOOK': SHOELESS IN THE KITCHEN \n\n\n\n   Parties catered by Ina Garten of the Barefoot Contessa in East\nHampton, N.Y., are characterized by dauntingly lavish, artfully\narranged displays of vegetables, breads, fruit, cheeses and cakes.\nBut as her ``Barefoot Contessa Cookbook'' (Clarkson N. Potter,\n$32.50) now reveals, the food from her shop could not be more\naccessible.\n\n\n   Aside from a few omissions, like the temperature for baking the\nterrific chocolate buttercream cake, this is an excellent starter\ncookbook, to set the novice on the path to successful dinners and\nparties, especially looking toward summer. Bright photographs, by\nMelanie Acevedo, show exactly how most of the food should look, and\nillustrations show the differences between mincing, dicing,\njulienne and chiffonade.\n\n\n   The recipes are replete with nice little touches, like the black\nsesame seeds garnishing the oil-glossed sugar snap peas, and\ndirections for roasting some of the tomatoes for the tomato-basil\nsoup. But with few exceptions, like the lobster pot pie, they are\nnot complicated.\n\n\n   Whenever possible, Ms. Garten suggests shortcuts, advance\npreparation and convenient substitutions, including canned and\nfrozen vegetables and prepared mayonnaise. Feel free to use\npackaged puff pastry, and do not expect to have to bake your own\nbread to re-create her food.\n\n\n   Little notes accompany the recipes, elaborating on the\ningredients and techniques. The navel orange segments specified in\nthe pretty beet salad, for example, must be cut away from the\nmembrane, not merely separated as when eating an orange.\n\n\n   All the dishes are designed for entertaining, whether it's\nplying weekend guests with staggeringly rich scones for breakfast,\nassembling an array of tasty dips to be scooped with endive leaves\nfor cocktails, making a big turkey meatloaf for more than one meal\nor recycling extra grilled lemon chicken breasts into a salad.\n\n\n   Most of the recipes serve six or more, and many will feed 10.\n(That chocolate buttercream cake will serve up to 12; bake it at\n350 degrees.)\n\n\n   Want to dazzle your guests? Try the roasted whole boned salmon\nwith a fennel stuffing. It couldn't be easier, and it most\ncertainly will produce raves when served at a buffet or dinner for\n10 to 15.\n\n\n   BEETS WITH ORANGE VINAIGRETTE\n\n\n   Adapted from ``The Barefoot Contessa Cookbook''\n\n\n   Time: 1 1/2 hours\n\n\n   3 bunches fresh beets\n\n\n   Kosher salt\n\n\n   2 navel oranges\n\n\n   2 tablespoons raspberry vinegar\n\n\n   2 tablespoons freshly squeezed orange juice\n\n\n   3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil\n\n\n   1/2 teaspoon sugar\n\n\n   1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\n\n\n   1/2 cup finely diced red onion.\n\n\n   1. Trim green tops from beets and place beets in large pot of\nsalted water. Bring to a boil and simmer uncovered about 1 hour, or\nuntil just tender. Drain and set aside until cool enough to handle.\n\n\n   2. Remove zest from oranges, preferably in long strips. Slice\noff the rest of the skin and all the pith. Holding the oranges over\na large bowl to catch any juice, use a sharp knife to cut the\nsegments out, away from the membrane.\n\n\n   3. Peel and dice beets into 1/2-inch pieces.

With all of the freshly prepared foods _ fresh\nsalsa, cleaned and deveined shrimp, prewashed salad mixes and\nsmoked tofu, just to name a few _ why not take advantage?\n\n   However, some pre-prepared foods are better than others. Many\ncommercial pestos, for instance, have lost their fresh herbal\nflavor by the time you get them.\n\n\n   The trick is to find the best products. Pasta Etc. brand pesto,\nmade in Sonoma, has no cheese or oil and is flavored with miso.\nThat may not sound like pesto at all, but its bright basil flavor\nworks very well in this week's Fast &AMP; Fresh recipe.\n\n\n   The recipe is simple but elegant enough for a dinner party\nbecause of the way it looks _ luscious pink salmon atop golden\ncouscous, accented with green basil sauce. Quick pan-frying gives\nthe fillets a crisp crust and moist interior, and the pesto sauce,\nmixed with lemon juice, cuts through the richness of the fish.\n\n\n   Another excellent prepared product is achiote paste. Widely used\nin Mexico's Yucatan region, this seasoning base is made of ground\nannatto seeds, spices, vinegar and sometimes garlic. Mixed with oil\nand additional seasonings, achiote is an instant marinade that\ngives intense flavor and an appealing saffron-red color to meat and\nfish.\n\n\n   In this week's 30-minute recipe, chicken breasts are marinated\nin achiote, then quickly broiled. The chicken is placed on top of a\nsalad of crisp jicama and arugula dressed with lime juice and a\ntouch of cayenne, bringing the vibrant marinade to life.\n\n\n   Like all lasagnas, the Now &AMP; Later recipe, Lentil and Butternut\nSquash Lasagna, involves many steps. But it's worth every minute\nyou spend behind the stove.\n\n\n   A vegetarian dish created by my non-meat-eating friend\nElisabeth, the lasagna brings together butternut squash, roasted\nuntil creamy, with firm French lentils and intensely sweet\ncaramelized onions. A rich b &LR; e &LR; chamel sauce makes the layers float\non top of each other like clouds.\n\n\n   When making a many-stepped recipe like Lentil and Butternut\nSquash Lasagna, do all the prep work ahead of time. Chop the\nvegetables and herbs, measure the liquids and grate the cheese\nbefore you start cooking. Being organized allows you to cook many\nthings at once instead of trying to chop while minding something on\nthe stove.\n\n\n   If you like, break up the preparation by cooking the b &LR; e &LR; chamel\nand vegetables ahead of time, then layering the lasagna the next\nday. To reheat b &LR; e &LR; chamel, add a bit more milk and heat it slowly,\nstirring constantly. Do not allow it to boil.\n\n\n   &QL; \nFAST &AMP; FRESH: dinner in about 20 minutes\n\n\n   &LR;  &QL; \n &LR; PAN-FRIED SALMON FILLETS WITH LEMON PESTO &AMP; COUSCOUS\n\n\n   Ingredients:\n\n\n   6 tablespoons prepared pesto sauce (see note)\n\n\n   1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice\n\n\n   1 (10-ounce) package instant couscous\n\n\n   1/2 teaspoon salt + salt to taste\n\n\n   2 tablespoons + 1 teaspoon olive oil\n\n\n   4 boned skinless salmon fillets, 5 to 6 ounces each and 1-inch\nthick\n\n\n   Freshly ground pepper to taste\n\n\n   4 lemon wedges\n\n\n   Instructions:\n\n\n   If possible, let the pesto sit at room temperature for 20\nminutes before beginning preparation.\n\n\n   Mix together the pesto sauce and lemon juice.

Your HDL-C level should be\n35 mg/dL or higher.\n\n\n   ``Bad'' cholesterol is LDL-C, or low-density lipoprotein\ncholesterol.

      "content": "VEGGIE OUT WITH CURTIS\n\n\n\n   With unrestrained enthusiasm and a smile wider than the\nChattahoochee River, Curtis Aikens makes his success look like\nchild's play.\n\n\n   The burly, vegetarian star of the cable TV Food Network's ``Pick\nof the Day'' has an irresistible sweetness that could make even the\nmost dedicated meat-and-potatoes eater want to gobble a plate of\ngrilled tofu.\n\n\n   All that positive energy is exactly what Aikens used to mask a\ndark secret for more than 20 years.\n\n\n   ``I'm the first African-American to have a cooking show on TV,\nyet I didn't learn to read until I was 26,'' Aikens, 40, said\nduring a brief break in a whirlwind Fort Worth weekend.\n\n\n   ``Sharing with kids is what's so important that you achieve\nthings by reaching for them,'' Aikens said. ``I tell the kids to\nset goals, to strive to be better and to give back.''\n\n\n   Wherever he goes to do personal appearances, either cooking for\na charity event or publicizing his latest cookbook, Aikens finds an\noutlet for spreading his literacy gospel and talking to children\nabout overcoming odds.\n\n\n   Aikens was born in Conyers, Ga., just east of Atlanta. He said\nhe didn't suffer from dyslexia but just wasn't taught properly. He\nrepeated the third grade and just ``schmoozed'' his way through the\nrest of school.\n\n\n   ``It was exhausting,'' he said. ``I wish someone had been as\nopen to me about asking for help as I try to be when I'm talking to\nkids.''\n\n\n   He practices what he preaches about giving back: All royalties\nfrom his cookbooks _ the latest of three is 1995's ``Curtis Cooks\nWith Heart and Soul'' (William Morris, $23) _ go to reading and\nliteracy programs, he said.\n\n\n   Aikens was 26 and running his own produce business in the San\nFrancisco area when he saw a TV commercial for a literacy program.\nIt promised confidentiality, and Aikens got the tutoring he\ndesperately needed.\n\n\n   Drawing on the passion that his mother, Laura, has for cooking,\nAikens turned his love of vegetables and food preparation into a\nhigh-profile career. He made his mother's pumpkin pie first when he\nlaunched his TV cooking show in Atlanta in 1989.\n\n\n   ``Mama taught me to cook; she's my big inspiration. There's\nnothing like her collard greens and corn bread,'' he said. ``She's\nproud of me, and I'm proud of her, too.''\n\n\n   Soon he was the produce man on ABC-TV's ``Home Show,'' and his\nfirst cookbook was published in 1990.\n\n\n   His vegetarian theme has had staying power. Originally, he\nsought a meat-free diet to lose weight but wound up sticking with\nit because ``vegetables eat and taste good.''\n\n\n   ``I'm not anti-meat. I just grew up loving and eating\nvegetables,'' he said. ``Our family always believed that vegetables\nare as big a part of the meal as meat.''\n\n\n   What's his favorite vegetable? Whatever's fresh. Aikens enjoys\nsauteing veggies in a tiny bit of olive oil and adding a bit of a\nfavorite salad dressing or some marinara for serving. Or he'll\ngrill asparagus, potatoes and any other vegetables that are handy.\n\n\n   ``Most people have no idea how easy this is,'' he said. ``You\nsaute the vegetables a few minutes, cook some pasta and in 10\nminutes, it's on the table.''\n\n\n   When he's feeling nostalgic, his favorite dish to make is\ncollard greens, cooked with an onion, sliced bell pepper, garlic, a\nbit of olive oil and salt. He's happy to report, too, that he can\nnow find decent collard greens in California.\n\n\n   ``Okra is one of my real favorites, but the Southern kind is\nhard to get in California. The okra we get there from Chile just\nisn't the same,'' he said.\n\n\n   That's important because Aikens splits his time _ when he's not\ntaping the TV show in New York _ between homes in Georgia and in\nMarin County, where his two young sons live, north of San\nFrancisco.\n\n\n   Travels will soon take Aikens on his first trip to Great\nBritain. That's where he'll be working on a new international\nliteracy program with suspense novelist Ken Follett, whom he met\nrecently through mutual friend Robin Leach while vacationing in\nAntigua.

And the newest cookbooks are brimming\nwith the discovery.\n\n\n   Morgan offers an olive melange with fennel seeds, and low-fat\ntuna and fennel salad pitas. Steven Raichlen stuffs the bulb into\nsea bass in ``The Barbecue! Bible.'' Raichlen also dries the stalks\nand throws them on the fire to perfume the smoke. James Peterson\neven deep-fries fennel in his just-published ``Vegetables.''\n\n\n   Fennel's natural season is fall through late spring, but with\nthe miracle of modern supermarkets and importing, it's available\nall year. Which is good, because the clean, crisp flavor is a\nwelcome summer taste.\n\n\n   Sometimes labeled ``anise,'' larger bulbs will probably be\nfibrous and should be peeled with a vegetable peeler.

This marine vegetable is an anomaly of\nnature, not industry _ though it would not be showing up in stores\nnow without a little help from human hands.\n\n\n   Sea parsley, a tiny, curly leafed, burgundy-colored seaweed, is\na miniature version of dulse, the red marine plant best known to\ndiners as an ingredient in seaweed salads in Japanese restaurants.\nIt is a natural mutation, discovered in 1978 by a group of\nscientists off Grand Manan Island in the Bay of Fundy, near the\ncoast of Maine.\n\n\n   The scientists formed a company, Ocean Produce International, to\ncultivate the seaweed in saltwater tanks and sell it.\n\n\n   Until a few months ago, this delicacy was known only to Japanese\nand other Asian cooks, as well as vegetarians, who bought it\ndirectly from the company. But now it is being sold, in one-ounce\npackages, for about $5 at specialty groceries in New York. It is\nalso available by mail order from Adriana's Caravan, (800)\n316-0820.\n\n\n   It did not take long for chefs to be captivated by this new\ningredient, which smells like the ocean but whose taste changes,\ndepending on how it is used.\n\n\n   Rick Moonen, the executive chef of Oceana, said that sea parsley\n``seems to have a natural affinity to Asian ingredients, but also\nclassic French preparations, like consomme.'' He adds it to seafood\nsoups or stews or to the pot when steaming a fish. The seaweed\nlends a briny yet clean flavor.\n\n\n   As a Canadian product, sea parsley often turns up on the menu at\nthe Canadian Consulate in New York, where Louis Charest, the\nexecutive chef, has been using it for a year or so. He chops it and\nadds it to salads, as he would arugula. He also uses it to flavor\nsalmon, sturgeon and turbot dishes; buries a fish in it for\nsteaming, and includes it in a warm lobster salad.\n\n\n   Sea parsley, like most seaweed, is packed with vitamins and\ncalcium, and contains amino acids, which break down food fibers and\npermeate them, changing their texture. If sea parsley is used raw\nor barely cooked, the changes are subtle. If simmered or broiled\nwith other ingredients, however, it tenderizes them and alters\ntheir taste.\n\n\n   What chefs have discovered about this chameleon of a vegetable\nis that when it is fresh and raw, it has a mild nutty taste with\nhints of oyster and lots of crunch. When fried, it becomes a golden\ngreen color and very crisp, and tastes more like bacon.\n\n\n   Boiled sea parsley becomes deep green and takes on a mussel-like\ntaste. Sun dried, it has a roasted vegetable flavor. Fresh out of a\nmicrowave oven, it tastes more like nori and is great when mixed\nwith a little rice vinegar.\n\n\n   So go ahead and do what the chefs do _ experiment. Fry some sea\nparsley and sprinkle it like croutons on a salad, particularly a\nsalad accompanying cold or smoked seafood, or use it as a garnish\nfor seafood or vegetable dishes or as an accompaniment to smoked\nfish, sushi and sashimi.\n\n\n   For a wonderful blast of the ocean, add it to broths for\npoaching or steaming. When boiled in lightly salted water for 15\nminutes, sea parsley produces a broth that tastes like clam and\noyster juices _ a good base for a chowder or a quick seafood stew.\n\n\n   Visually, it may take some imagination to recognize the\nsimilarities between surf parsley and the more familiar turf\nparsley. But just as curly or flat leaf parsley gives a dish a\nwhiff of the garden, its marine counterpart bespeaks the mysterious\nflavors of the deep.\n\n\n   SEA PARSLEY SALAD WITH RICE WINE VINAIGRETTE\n\n\n   Time: 40 minutes\n\n\n   For the dressing:\n\n\n   2 teaspoons sesame oil\n\n\n   3 tablespoons vegetable oil\n\n\n   { shallot, minced\n\n\n   4 teaspoons rice wine vinegar\n\n\n   2 teaspoons lemon juice\n\n\n   1 tablespoon soy sauce.\n\n\n   For the salad:\n\n\n   One-third cup vegetable oil\n\n\n   4 cups (about 3 ounces) sea parsley\n\n\n   3 carrots, peeled and finely julienned\n\n\n   1{ cups peeled and finely julienned jicama\n\n\n   2",

      "content": "IMPROVISING A SALAD FROM THE GARDEN \n\n\n\n   NEW YORK _ When I was the chef at Greens, the vegetarian\nrestaurant in San Francisco, we were affiliated with Green Gulch\nFarm, which was just across the Golden Gate Bridge, in Marin\nCounty. I lived at the farm and worked closely with the head\ngardener, and together we found and grew unusual seeds. As a\nresult, we were able to serve all kinds of exotic vegetables at the\nrestaurant. Although today it's expected that a restaurant of any\nstature will be working with farmers or even have its own farm, in\n1979 this was not the case.\n\n\n   After driving the crates of produce across the bridge to the\nrestaurant, more often than not I found that I had nothing in\nenough quantity to feature by itself. So one of my menu standards\nwas what we called Farm Salad _ a composed salad of raw, steamed,\npickled and grilled vegetables, with a few sauces, usually\naccompanied by a wedge of frittata or some hard-cooked eggs, also\nfrom the farm. By necessity, these salads were ever-changing, but\nall presented a variety of tastes and textures.\n\n\n   Now, I choose vegetables from the farmers' market and my small\ngarden, and I've vastly simplified the number of ingredients and\nthe method, using just one dressing for everything. I steam or\nparboil most of the vegetables, but there is certainly room for raw\nvegetables, grilled peppers or onions, and pickled vegetables or\nolives. This dish allows you to improvise based on what's around\nand how much you want to do.\n\n\n   These days, I like a pestolike dressing based on fresh, fragrant\nmarjoram. Like basil, marjoram is widely used in Liguria, the\nregion around the Italian Riviera. Marjoram has a wonderful,\npowerful flavor, and it's tied together here with other typical\ningredients, like capers, pine nuts and olives, in a sauce akin to\none used in the Ligurian salad called cappon magro, which is\nusually composed of a variety of fish and vegetables. (If you want\nto add cold steamed or grilled fish to the farm salad, it's\nperfectly appropriate.) I find it difficult to avoid eating this\ndelicious sauce with a spoon or spreading it on bread.\n\n\n   Although the sauce recipe below is fairly precise, the vegetable\nsuggestions are just that: suggestions. If you figure at least 12\nounces of vegetables a person, along with a little protein _ in the\nform of hard-boiled egg, fish or a combination _ the meal will work\nout fine.\n\n\n   FARM SALAD WITH MARJORAM SAUCE\n\n\n   Time: about 1 hour\n\n\n   4 medium beets, or more small ones\n\n\n   12 small new potatoes\n\n\n   1 pound green beans, trimmed\n\n\n   4 to 8 small carrots, peeled\n\n\n   2 red onions, peeled and cut into half-inch rounds\n\n\n   2 small zucchini, cut in half lengthwise\n\n\n   { cup plus 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil\n\n\n   1 {-inch-thick slice good white bread, crusts trimmed\n\n\n   2 tablespoons red wine vinegar\n\n\n   1 teaspoon minced garlic\n\n\n   2 tablespoons marjoram leaves\n\n\n   3 tablespoons drained capers\n\n\n   { cup pine nuts\n\n\n   1 cup finely minced parsley leaves\n\n\n   2 tablespoons pitted olives, like nicoise\n\n\n   Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste\n\n\n   12 radishes, trimmed\n\n\n   4 to 8 pickled artichoke hearts (canned are fine)\n\n\n   1 medium cucumber, trimmed and cut into eighths\n\n\n   4 hard-cooked eggs, cut in half.\n\n\n   1.

      "content": "TEA? TURMERIC? THE QUEST FOR SAFER BARBECUE\n\n\n\n   The height of the barbecue season is not when anyone wants to\nhear about the hazards of eating meat with a nicely blackened crust\nhot off the grill. But scientists have long known that substances\ncreated when meat and poultry are cooked at high heat can cause\ncancer in animals and that there is some evidence that they may\nhave the same effect on humans.\n\n\n   While health professionals still recommend cutting back on\noverall meat consumption, recent research suggests that there are\nmore appealing ways to make grilled meat less hazardous. Some are\ncommon-sensical, like eating it rare (though this is not\nrecommended for chicken or hamburger) or medium instead of well\ndone, or cooking it at lower temperatures for shorter periods. But\nothers are more startling, like sprinkling meat with tea powder, or\nmixing ground meat with cherries, or just marinating meat before\ncooking.\n\n\n   Clearly, scientists are now so aware of the potential risks that\nthey are looking into every corner of the kitchen for solutions.\nBut their research is in its earliest stages, so they are not\nreally sure how or why some of these techniques work.\n\n\n   ``It's hard for scientists to say we don't know,'' said Dr. Mark\nG. Knize, a member of the Biology and Biotechnology Research\nProgram at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in Livermore,\nCalif., who is conducting some of the research on the effects of\nmarinades.\n\n\n   For whatever reason, though, he and other scientists have found\nthat one of the most promising techniques for meat and poultry is\nmarination. Done even briefly, it reduces the cancer-causing\ncompounds called heterocyclic amines, or HCA's, formed when\ncreatine in muscle meats reacts with amino acids at high\ntemperatures. (Fish is much less a problem than meat or poultry.)\nBut marination does nothing to reduce the level of other\ncarcinogens that arise when fat falls on a fire and causes smoke.\n\n\n   Scientists have not yet deconstructed all their marinade\ningredients to pinpoint the anti-cancer agents. They suspect that\nthe antioxidants in certain foods like garlic, onions, chives,\nturmeric, thyme, rosemary and oregano, as well as vitamins C and E,\nare responsible.\n\n\n   In studies last year at the Cancer Research Center of Hawaii in\nHonolulu, three different sauces were used to marinate steaks\novernight. One was a teriyaki sauce, another contained turmeric and\ngarlic powder and the third was a commercial sauce made of honey,\nhigh-fructose corn syrup, vinegar, concentrated tomato juice,\nmodified food starch, salt and seasonings. Four-ounce pieces of\nmarinated and unmarinated steak were cooked on a propane gas grill\nfor varying times at varying temperatures. The marinades were not\nreapplied during cooking.\n\n\n   The shorter the cooking time and the lower the heat, the lower\nthe levels of the suspect amines in meats marinated in the teriyaki\nand turmeric sauces, compared with unmarinated meat. Steaks\nmarinated in the commercial sauce and cooked similarly had much\nhigher levels of the amines than the other marinated meats; the\nresearchers said this may have been partly because the corn syrup\nand honey caused the steaks to burn and char faster and more\nextensively.\n\n\n   I conducted taste tests on the teriyaki and turmeric sauces. The\nturmeric marinade adds flavor to tender but otherwise tasteless\nsteak, while the teriyaki makes meat slightly sweet, although the\nbrown sugar it contains causes the meat to burn faster.\n\n\n   In a 1997 study at Lawrence Livermore, researchers marinated\nchicken breasts in a mixture including garlic, salt, citrus juice\nand olive oil that also contained considerable sugar, and they\nconcluded that the sugar was probably responsible for an increase\nin one of the amines. Using sweet commercial barbecue sauces may be\njust the wrong thing.\n\n\n   Other researchers are looking into other antidotes. Dr. John\nWeisburger, director emeritus of the nonprofit American Health\nFoundation in New York, has done studies indicating that sprinkling\ntea powder, either green or black, on m",

Not that the room gleams\nwith marble and stainless steel like a designer's fantasy, or that\nit's packed with gimmicks and gadgets, or that everything matches.\nUtility is the hallmark here. A bright yellow La Cornue range\nstands along one wall, and a big rectangular copper sink catches\nthe eye, but at heart, this is a kitchen made for cooking, not\nlooking.\n\n\n   One Tuesday morning in early November, it was dressed for\nautumn. Branches of red and orange and mottled yellow leaves filled\na handsome purple glass vase, along with blowsy Cafe au Lait\ndahlias and yellow English Garden roses.\n\n\n   The mistress of the house had laid out big bowls of pomegranates\nand persimmons, walnuts and chestnuts, Ida Rose apples and Adriatic\nfigs and crab apples. Quinces, too, that someone had filched from\nan old tree on a vacant lot nearby. A stalk of brussels sprouts lay\non the table, and a cabbage, a Platonic ideal of a cabbage, its\nouter leaves unfurled into a sort of halo, sat on a metal stand.\n\n\n   Food as still life, fit for a 17th-century Dutch master.\n\n\n   An oak fire, lighted at 7 o'clock, had produced a fine bed of\ncoals beneath the plump hen turkey that was revolving on a stout\nspit. Alice Waters (for it was she, in a long striped apron and\nblack chef's clogs) was rehearsing for Thanksgiving 1999, reaching\ninto the kitchen fireplace with a long branch of rosemary to baste\nthe browning bird with warm olive oil.\n\n\n   Why a rosemary branch?\n\n\n   ``Why not?'' Ms. Waters replied. ``It's pretty, and it works\nwell, and it adds a bit of flavor.''\n\n\n   By the time I turned up to watch, along with my wife, Betsey,\ntwo of Ms. Waters' longtime colleagues at Chez Panisse, the\ninfluential Berkeley restaurant she has run since 1971, had joined\nher. They were trimming vegetables with the short, sure strokes of\nthe professional that make amateurs like me so jealous. Both of\nthem _ Jean-Pierre Moulle, a bearded, soft-spoken native of the\nCharente region in southwestern France, and Fritz Streiff, a\nHarvard man who wears Philip Johnson glasses _ have helped her to\nestablish the restaurant's worldwide reputation for extraordinarily\nfresh, organically grown raw materials, cooked simply and superbly\nin a hybrid Italo-Franco-Californian style.\n\n\n   ``It's the first real day of fall,'' Moulle said. In the\nbackyard garden, pomelos and Meyer lemons still hung from the\ntrees, and exactly four raspberries fought against time on a bush\nnear the guest cottage, but there was a nip in the air that the\nbright sunshine could not quite dispel.\n\n\n   As they worked, the three cooks chatted about the provenance of\nthe ingredients that would go into Ms. Waters' Thanksgiving feast.\nThe unusually fine-leaved escarole and the fabulously peppery\nwatercress for the salad had been grown by Bob Cannard in the\nValley of the Moon in Sonoma County, northwest of Berkeley. The\nsourdough bread had come, of course, from the Acme Bakery just a\nfew blocks away, one of the cluster of establishments that have\nflourished here since the food revolution began 30-odd years ago.\nThe vegetables had come from various farmers' markets, and the\ncranberries for the upside-down cake baked by the restaurant's\npastry chef, Charlene Reis, from the Ladybug Cooperative in Oregon.\n\n\n   ``I could have, would have, should have made the cake, if I'd\nhad the time,'' volunteered Ms. Waters, an intense, pale-skinned\nwoman who was once a Montessori teacher. ``It's easy enough for\neven me to do.''\n\n\n   The cranberries really slayed me. You have to be a bit of a\nmaniac to conceive of organic cranberries, let alone find them, and\nMs. Waters pleaded guilty.\n\n\n   ``Sometimes you go to extremes,'' she said.\n\n\n   She has gone so far as to hire a forager, Alan Tangren, who\nsearches not only for wild nettles a",

      "content": "VEGGIES SIZZLE ON THE GRILL\n\n\n\n   Grilling and backyard barbecues most often conjure up images of\nsizzling steaks, burgers, chicken or fish.\n\n\n   But has it ever crossed your mind to toss a colorful array of\nfresh vegetables on the grill? If not, you'll be amazed at how\nsimple, healthy and fabulous tasting grilled produce can be.\n\n\n   ``Most vegetables cook beautifully on the grill with just a\nminimum of preparation or attention,'' notes Kelly McCune in her\n``Vegetables on the Grill'' cookbook.\n\n\n   ``We have been encouraging people to cook an entire meal on the\ngrill for years, and finally people are coming around,'' says Betty\nHughes, consumer affairs director for Weber-Stephen Products Co.,\nthe company that manufactures Weber grills. ``People are really\nmissing out if they don't do vegetables on the grill.''\n\n\n   Grilling vegetables heightens their natural sweetness resulting\nin a fabulous smoky, carmelized flavor that is very different from\nthose that are steamed, microwaved or boiled.\n\n\n   The smoky flavor is derived from the juices from the vegetables\ndropping down on the grill's heat source and thus cooking and\ncarmelizing the sugars in the vegetables, says Hughes. ``You'll get\nthe same smoky flavor whether you use a gas or charcoal grill.''\n\n\n   For more of a wood flavor add flavored wood chips to a gas\ngrill, advises Hughes. Simply place wet chips in a small foil pan\nand put the pan in the hottest area of the grill underneath the\ncooking grates, which in Weber gas grills is in the front left hand\ncorner. Don't place the food directly above the chips to avoid a\nflare up or a fire.\n\n\n   Experiment and learn what works best on your grill. Here are\nsome tips for success _ gleaned from experts and our hands-on\nexperience:\n\n\n   Vegetables are easiest to manage and hold their shape best when\ngrilled in larger pieces. For instance, cut zucchini and eggplant\n(either Japanese or regular) into lengthwise slices rather than\nsmall pieces. Tomatoes are best grilled halved rather than in\nslices or quarters. Same goes for red, white or yellow onions and\nred, green or yellow bell peppers. Asparagus, mushrooms and green\nonions should be left whole.\n\n\n   To keep asparagus spears from falling through the cooking\ngrates, use thicker spears or tie thinner spears together into\nbundles of five or six spears with plain kitchen twine.\n\n\n   There are several ways to grill corn on the cob. You can soak\nthe husks in water for an hour and then place them on the grill or\ncook in the husks without soaking. Unlike other veggies, corn needs\nto be turned often when grilling. If desired, a couple of minutes\nbefore serving, peel back the husks to get a little brown color and\ngrill marks on the corn, along with some additional smoky flavor.\n\n\n   For best results and fastest cooking, be sure the grill is very\nhot before adding the vegetables of your choice, emphasizes Hughes.\nStart a charcoal grill 30 minutes in advance of cooking or preheat\na gas grill for 10 to 15 minutes.\n\n\n   The simplest and best way to grill vegetables is to brush them\nall over with olive or vegetable oil, and place on the grill.

      "content": "Peter Martinelli, a Marin rancher committed to sustainable\nagriculture and organic farming, has a similarly optimistic message\nabout what many perceive as adversarial opposites. He thinks\ntraditional agricultural interests and environmentalists can be\nfriends, working together toward changes in land use that benefit\nboth interests.\n\n\n   Martinelli's family has been farming just north of Bolinas since\nthe 1930s. He didn't plan to follow in his father's and\ngrandfather's footsteps, but rather studied English and history at\nthe University of California at Berkeley.\n\n\n   The pull of the land, however, won out over academia. Not long\nafter graduation, Martinelli, now 36, was back in West Marin,\ntilling the soil and preaching the creed of the new environmentally\nsensitive farmer. He had a mentor of impeccable credentials: For\nnine years, he worked for Warren Weber, whose Star Route Farm,\nlaunched in the early '70s, was a trailblazer for a revitalized\norganic movement.\n\n\n   Martinelli, assisted by siblings and cousins, grows a variety of\ncool-werops _ potatoes, beets, carrots, lettuces (``no\ntomatoes or corn here,'' he jokes), garlic, chard, kale and winter\nsquash _ on his family's 20 acres.\n\n\n   The squash are particularly dear to his heart. They thrive in\nthe smket where his land is located _ it's a little more\nprotected than most of the surrounding land and therefore just a\nsmidgen warmer. The squash are also what he calls ``a low-life\nsupport crop'' _ from planting until harvest, they need little\ncare. They don't attract insects nor do they require much water.\n\n\n   Butternut and delicata are the most popular varieties _\nMartinelli says it's partly because of their sweetness and partly\nbecause they are manageable in size. Both those qualities appeal to\nhis customers who come to the Martinelli booth at the Saturday\nfarmers' market at Pt. Reyes Station and the Wednesday market in\nFairfax. He also has a stand at Tomales Bay that's open Wednesdays\nthrough Sundays.\n\n\n   The large _ in some instances, humongous _ squash he grows are\ngenerally headed for the kitchens of his restaurant clients, who\ninclude Manka's in Inverness, Insalata's in San Anselmo, and Chez\nPanisse and Cafe Rouge in Berkeley.\n\n\n   Restaurant chefs love to deal with these big boys _ kabocha,\nturban and banana, and the giant, curved Tahitian squash that\nresembles a butternut squash on growth hormones.\n\n\n   Martinelli intends to plant more varieties in the future,\nalthough he has already come at least half-circle. Historically,\nthe ranch, established in the 1870s, was first a dairy and apple\nfarm. His family started out raising beef cattle on the land, and\nthen he turned it into a vegetable farm.\n\n\n   He now feels that mixed use _ cattle and vegetables _ is\nprobably the most ecologically sound, allowing for on-site\nrecycling of just about all the byproducts of farming.\n\n\n   Martinelli's political fervor has not abated as his views have\nevolved. He lobbies government to provide incentives to family\nfarms so a healthy farm belt can survive around towns and cities.\nAnd he is dedicated to guiding consumers back to the once prevalent\nbelief that fresh food, lovingly grown in close proximity to its\nmarkets, delivers optimal taste and nutrition.",

      "content": "DARK-FLESHED FISH: A TASTE WORTH ACQUIRING \n\n\n\n   Eating certain foods can be a gustatory badge of courage. Liver,\nfor example, or sweetbreads or even some bitter Asian greens cause\nmany diners to just say, ``Yuck!''\n\n\n   High on this list are the so-called oily fish, like mackerel,\nbluefish, pompano and sardines. These dark-fleshed fish are\nroutinely passed over in favor of their milder white-fleshed\ncousins. But for anyone who appreciates real flavor, this is a\nserious error, because these fish have what those ubiquitous white\nfish do not: rich, distinctive taste.\n\n\n   So why does it take courage to face these fish? Perhaps the dark\ncolor is a bit daunting to neophytes. But mostly the same high oil\ncontent that makes these fish so flavorful also makes them very\nperishable. Many an unsuspecting diner has bought or been served a\nless-than-fresh version and was left to believe that that was the\nway the fish was supposed to taste. End of experiment.\n\n\n   This problem should be a thing of the past. With improved\nmethods of bringing fish to market, it is not that difficult to\nfind very fresh bluefish, mackerel, sardines, pompano or their\nhighly popular colleagues in this group, tuna and salmon.\n\n\n   Once a food has a tarnished reputation, though, it can be hard\nto rehabilitate it. So perhaps a bit of attitude adjustment is in\norder. Instead of thinking of these fish as oily, consider them\nrich-fleshed, and health-enhancing, too.\n\n\n   Making this mental change-over can bring great rewards. Stronger\nflavors are intrinsically more interesting to the adventurous\npalate and can also hold their own with aggressive ingredients like\nhot chilies, tangy citrus and briny olives. This allows the cook a\nmuch wider latitude in creating bold dishes.\n\n\n   Rich-fleshed fish also have an advantage when it comes to\ncooking methods. Because their high oil content keeps them moist\nand helps prevent their sticking to cooking surfaces, they lend\nthemselves well to grilling or broiling. For the same reason, they\nare ideally suited to smoking, a technique that imparts deep, rich\nflavors to seafood.\n\n\n   And in a deliciously paradoxical twist, the health benefits of\nthese fish come from that bad boy of nutritional policy, fat.\nCalled omega-3 fatty acids, the fats in these fish are thought to\nhave many benefits, the best-established being the prevention of\nheart problems. Omega-3's have been repeatedly shown to help\nprevent heart attacks.\n\n\n   Some experts, including researchers at the Jonsson Comprehensive\nCancer Center at the University of California at Los Angeles,\nbelieve that these fats may also help reduce the risk of breast\ncancer. In some patients, omega-3's have also been able to reduce\nthe painful symptoms of autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid\narthritis.\n\n\n   But the latest _ and most surprising _ word on omega-3's is that\nthey may help make people not only healthier but happier. This is\nthe opinion of Dr. Joseph Hibbeln, the chief of the outpatient\nclinic at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism,\npart of the National Institutes of Health.\n\n\n   After correlating immense amounts of data on diets and the\nincidence of clinical depression in various countries, Hibbeln\nfound that the more fish people eat, the less they seem to suffer\nfrom depression.\n\n\n   This theory was bolstered earlier this year when scientists in\nEngland found that individuals suffering from clinical depression\nhad significantly lower levels of docosahexaenoic acid, a primary\ncomponent of omega-3's, in their blood cells.\n\n\n   Fortunately, there are many fish to choose from if you want to\nget the flavor and health advantages of omega-3's. While very\ndark-fleshed fish like mackerel, sardines and herring are the\nhighest in oil content, rainbow trout, lake trout and the\never-popular salmon are also prime examples.\n\n\n   A single serving of Atlantic salmon, for instance, contains 18\ntimes as much omega-3 as the same-size piece of cod or mahi-mahi.\nWhichever of these fish you choose, buy only the very freshest.\nThey are almost always sold as whole fish, which yo",

      "content": "THE APPETITE WAITS FOR NO BIRD \n\n\n\n   Probably the most challenging part of cooking Thanksgiving\ndinner is deciding what to serve until the turkey is carved. You\nneed some kind of diversionary starter for everyone to nibble at\nwhile the lumps are being mashed out of the potatoes and whisked\nout of the gravy, but it can't be anything really rich or heavy or\nfilling, or no one will ever make it to the pumpkin pie.\n\n\n   And it certainly can't be anything that takes more than a few\ningredients and a couple of steps to assemble on a day when even\nthe best cook feels overwhelmed.\n\n\n   You could just go out and buy a few sneaky convenience foods,\nbut the flavors would seem off before a meal that celebrates real\nhome cooking. A better way to give the appearance of being a\ngenerous and caring cook without becoming a galley slave is to\nchoose from some quick, simple and surprisingly different starters\nbased on ideas borrowed from classic hors d'oeuvres.\n\n\n   Only one of these takes more than 15 minutes of work, most of\nthem far less. They are all familiar enough to serve to\nunadventurous relatives on this all-American holiday, but each one\nhas a little twist.\n\n\n   Perhaps my favorite is real onion dip, ideally served with\npotato chips but almost as good with calorie-deficient raw\nvegetables. Ever since Lipton took over the supermarket aisle,\nonion dip has been routinely made with powdered onion soup mix.\nEven in cookbooks you find recipes like, ``Stir 3 tablespoons onion\nsoup mix into 1 cup sour cream.'' There had to be a way to make it\nsimple without opening up a packet full of mystery ingredients.\n\n\n   It seemed to me that the original idea was to imitate the\ndominant flavor of onion soup _ caramelized onions _ so I tried\ndoing exactly that. I minced some onions, cooked them in oil until\nthey were well browned and then stirred them into sour cream.\n\n\n   It was a fresh, three-ingredient dip (if you count the oil,\nwhich you drain), with clarity, intensity and complexity of flavor.\n(You can make and serve this right away, but the onion taste\nintensifies if you allow it to sit, refrigerated, for about a day.)\n\n\n   Similarly, I decided I could improve on the standard recipe for\nshrimp cocktail sauce, which I always found thin and uninspired.\nWithout departing too far from the original, made with Heinz chili\nsauce, I came up with a richer, tastier cocktail sauce by borrowing\nan idea from the famed French chef Joel Robuchon, who adds a little\nbutter.\n\n\n   That not only makes the sauce cling to the shrimp better, but\nmakes it taste equally good warm or cold. (I like it warm, just as\na contrast to the cold shrimp.)\n\n\n   Three other Thanksgiving tidbits I developed are even easier,\nstarting with marinated olives. All you have to do is toss a\nvariety of olives in olive oil, garlic and herbs; let them stand an\nhour; then stand back while guests ask incredulously, ``What did\nyou do with these?''\n\n\n   The addition of a fragrant, tangy lemon cut into segments makes\nthem even more special. But the real key is to use an assortment of\ngood olives, preferably the kind produced in France, Italy, Greece\nor Spain and sold in bulk.\n\n\n   If possible, include some oil-cured olives, which really come to\nlife when marinated. You can marinate the olives up to a week in\nadvance if you like.\n\n\n   The unusually warm fall this year inspired another super-simple\nappetizer. Fresh figs are still in produce markets _ and still\nripening in California _ and they can be halved and stuffed with\nany creamy, flavorful cheese. Usually I rely on a good blue, but\ncreamy goat cheese, drizzled with balsamic vinegar, is more\ncrowd-pleasing.\n\n\n   Finally, I wanted a simple, light dipping sauce for raw\nvegetables, so I warmed olive oil with garlic, freshened the mix\nwith uncooked olive oil, seasoned it with lots of salt and pepper\nand spiked it with lemon rind. The flavors go great with fennel,\none of the easiest of vegetables to convert into crudites.\n\n\n   Just trim the bulb by cutting off the bottom half-inch or so,\nthen stand it up on its flat end and slice downward to ma",

      "content": "HOW TO ENJOY OLIVE OIL \n\n\n\n   SANTA ROSA, Calif. _ Olive oil on the table has been fashionable\nat many restaurants for the past decade. But not everyone knows\nwhat to do when confronted by silverware, napkin, fresh bread, salt\nand pepper _ and a bottle of olive oil.\n\n\n   You try to figure why there is no butter on the table, and what\nyou are supposed to do with the oil?\n\n\n   Hey, it's easy. Just pour the oil on your bread. If you get a\nsmall saucer, pour the oil on the saucer and dip your bread. Pour\ndirectly or dip. Either way is OK. If there is one plate of oil for\nthe whole table, just share, family-style, politely.\n\n\n   More and more restaurants, especially Italian ones, are adopting\nthe Mediterranean tableau, serving olive oil as a regular\ncondiment, leaving the butter in the kitchen.\n\n\n   If you have to have bread and butter too, don't hesitate to ask.\nIn most restaurants, the customer is always right.\n\n\n   But when the oil is there, consider pouring it on your bread, or\ndrizzling on top of a hearty vegetable soup or grilled vegetables.\n\n\n   Restaurateur Michael Hirschberg remembers shocking his staff 10\nyears ago when he said he wanted to put olive oil instead of butter\nat the table at his Ristorante Siena.\n\n\n   ``The waiters reacted in horror. I might have said we are going\nto put rat poison on the table,'' Hirschberg said.\n\n\n   Now that restaurant is Mistral and there still is olive oil,\nwith a pour spout, at every table. Mistral serves 100 lunches a\nday, and gets maybe one or two requests for butter.\n\n\n   ``People seem to understand. Some people pour it on to the\nbread, others on the plate and dip. I don't know if there is a\nproper way,'' Hirschberg said.\n\n\n   Marin County olive oil maven Nan McEvoy pours her signature oil\ninto soup and onto fresh bread. Healdsburg olive oil producer\nRidgley Evers likes drizzling his on fresh fish or delicately\ncooked French lentils.\n\n\n   The point of fine olive oil is that it enhances the taste of the\nfood.\n\n\n   Save the very best as an exquisite flavoring in butternut squash\nsoup, over grilled vegetables or dotted on gently steamed fava\nbeans, Evers said.\n\n\n   ``There is no one best oil. You should buy an inexpensive oil to\ncook with and you should use a series of very good oils to finish\nwith. You will end up with better flavor, less fat and spending\nless money,'' he said.\n\n\n   As the wine connoisseurs like to say: Try it. Your opinion is\nthe most important one.\n\n\n   (The Press Democrat in Santa Rosa, Calif., is part of the New\nYork Times Regional Newspaper Group.)",

Bret's storm surge carved open 12\nnew channels through the barrier islands along the Gulf from Port\nIsabel to Corpus Christi, allowing huge quantities of fresh sea\nwater to flood the bays.\n\n\n   ``Anytime you have a big storm event like this one _ and this\nstorm Bret went right through the center of the Laguna Madre,\ndumped a lot of water, raised the tides to very high levels _ it\nhas a big effect on the flushing of the Laguna Madre,'' said Ken\nDunton, an associate professor at the University of Texas Marine\nScience Institute at Port Aransas.\n\n\n   Dunton, an expert in sea grass and coastal marshes, expects new\nand expanded growth of three of the five species of sea grass,\nwhich serve as a nursery for shrimp, crabs and fish. Those grasses\n_ shoal grass, manatee grass and wigeon grass _ are also an\nimportant food source for millions of ducks that winter in Texas\nbays.\n\n\n   ``The long-term benefits of increased freshwater inflows through\na major event such as a hurricane to Texas estuaries far outweigh\nthe short-term, negative effects. Long-term, you'll see increased\nhabitat utilization by commercially important species of finfish\nand shellfish,'' including shrimp, blue crabs, trout, redfish and\nblack drum, Dunton said.\n\n\n   One of the immediate short-term concerns is the heavy runoff\nfrom farm lands, which means increased nitrates that promote algae\nblooms such as brown tide. Other concerns are that larval marine\nlife could have been flushed out of protective bays into the Gulf;\nsea grass could be covered in silt in areas near the new channels.\n\n\n   When Bret moved ashore late Sunday, huge quantities of rainwater\nwere dumped directly into a number of South Texas bays with\nrelatively high salt levels, rapidly lowering their salinity. As\nthe storm moved inland, additional freshwater poured into the bays\nafter draining into creeks, sloughs and rivers that form the\nwatershed for the lower Laguna Madre, Baffin Bay, the Nueces\nestuary _ which includes Corpus Christi Bay, Nueces Bay and Redfish\nBay _ and the Aransas estuary.\n\n\n   ``What that means is when you flush the system like that, you're\ncarrying away a lot of material in the Laguna Madre that has been\nsitting there decaying for a long time, dead sea grasses and\nvegetation that has been rotting, and you're revitalizing the\nsystem,'' said Dunton, who has been studying the bay system for the\nlast 13 years.\n\n\n   ``You're exposing substrates, or (bottom) areas that have not\nbeen exposed for a while, providing perhaps new opportunity for sea\ngrass growth or growth expansion, through the removal of this dead\nand decaying material.''\n\n\n   Late last week, state wildlife biologists and officials from the\nTexas General Land Office were preparing to take aerial photographs\nof Gulf beaches where Bret cut a dozen new channels above and below\nthe Port Mansfield cut, which divides North and South Padre Isla",

      "content": "FENNEL ADDS A LILT \n\n\n\n   A single vegetable brought to its essence _ that's the meaning\nof summer soup. Winter soups, with their soothing richness and\nwarmth, tend to be a composition of ingredients _ beef-vegetable,\nchicken-noodle, chowder, minestrone.\n\n\n   But summer soups refresh rather than soothe. And with so many\nvegetables hitting their peak of freshness, my first urge for\nsummer soups is to isolate each one and make it more than what it\nis on the vine, to refine it to its purest form. (An exception is a\nbright gazpacho, whose many flavors blend into a single taste.)\n\n\n   The beauty of summer soups _ one main ingredient served hot or\ncold _ is that they're so easy. Zucchini, spinach, tomato, bell\npepper: the less you change them, the better.\n\n\n   The technique for all vegetables is the same; learn it and you\ncan transform any vegetable into an extraordinary summer soup,\nwhether it's pea or fennel, watercress or artichoke, tomato,\ncarrot, haricots verts or even a soup of fine herbs, tarragon,\nchive, parsley and chervil.\n\n\n   It's just a matter of cooking your vegetable, pureeing it in a\nblender, adjusting the consistency with stock or water, seasoning\nit, and straining. Some vegetables, like tomatoes and cucumbers,\ndon't need to be cooked.\n\n\n   The principle is simple: separate the flavor and color from what\ncontains it, the cellulose. The tool that separates it is the\nchinois.\n\n\n   The chinois, a fine-meshed conical sieve, is critical to these\nsoups. It creates the texture of luxury. The chinois combines\nlayers of fine mesh that catch even the smallest particles of\nfiber, producing a finely textured liquid that feels like silk or\nsatin. Certainly, you could heat your puree and serve it without\nstraining, or you might pass it through a food mill and then\nthrough a strainer. But again, when you're looking for an essence\nof something, you must remove all the extraneous vegetable fiber\nthat has no flavor.\n\n\n   My thinking about soups is so similar to my approach to sauces\nthat I always wonder, is sauce a soup or is soup a sauce? Which\ncame first? If it's a great summer soup, it can be a great sauce,\ntoo. And vice versa. Sometimes we'll make a sauce that tastes so\ngood, we decide to put it in a cup and call it soup.\n\n\n   Soups are the most chameleonlike dishes. They can be served at\nany point during the meal _ as a canape, a first course, the\nperfect intermezzo, a dessert canape, the dessert or a sauce.\n\n\n   My favorite way is as opening canapes _ two or three spoonfuls\nof intense flavor presented in small white bowls before the meal\nbegins. A canape soup excites the senses and prepares you for the\nmeal ahead. And these summer soups make the very best canapes,\nbecause they focus on a single flavor. One sip of carrot soup\nshould be as powerful in flavor as a mouthful of carrots.\n\n\n   Elements of finesse make a big difference. And cooking the\nvegetable well is one of them. All green vegetables should be\ncooked in so much water that the water does not lose its boil,\nwater that has a cup of salt for every gallon, and the cooked\nvegetable must immediately be shocked in ice water. This big-pot\nblanching and chilling insures the brightest green possible.\n\n\n   Root vegetables and red and yellow bell peppers are simmered in\na small amount of stock or cream, then blended.\n\n\n   Another element of finesse is introducing some sort of fat _\ncream or oil _ to enrich the flavor and add body, although some\nvegetables, like cucumber and sorrel, require no fat. Perhaps\nyou'll also want an acid like sherry or balsamic vinegar.\n\n\n   Some vegetables benefit from a secondary component (add a little\nblanched dill to the cucumber puree for cucumber soup, for\ninstance). But ultimately, the great summer soup is a single cooked\nvegetable pureed and strained through a chinois.\n\n\n   Gazpacho is the perfect warm-weather soup, and the\ninterpretation I offer here is intense, and easy. The main\ntechnique is turning on your blender, and then straining the\nliquid. The flavor is extraordinary because you're using fresh\ningredients _ cucumbers, onion,",

Because of economic problems in Asia and a large \nsurplus, prices have dropped to half what his father made for \ncotton in the 1950s. \n\n\n\tEspecially troubling for farmers like Pacheco is that for the  \nfirst time in eight years, American cotton growers won't have \nfederal dollars to help them export crops worldwide, said Wayne \nBjorlie of the U.S. Farm Service Agency. \n\n\n\tThe result? When Pacheco harvests his cotton this winter, he  \nmight not be able to compete with cheaper cotton overseas. This \nwould make the surplus rise and prices slump even more. \n\n\n\t``I'm not sure if we're in a crisis situation now, but there  \nwill be one in the future if something doesn't happen soon,'' said \nWiley Murphy, president of the Arizona Cotton Growers Association. \n\n\n\tCotton -- one of the Arizona's five C's along with copper,  \ncitrus, climate and cattle -- is the state's biggest agricultural \ncrop. \n\n\n\tIn 1997, Arizona farmers produced 888,800 bales of cotton worth  \n$286 million. Much of this has been for export to such countries as \nJapan. \n\n\n\tSince 1991, the federal government has helped cotton farmers  \ncompete with lower prices in other countries by paying exporters to \nbuy U.S. cotton. In 1996, Congress capped these export incentives \nto $701 million -- enough money, lawmakers thought, to last until \n2002. \n\n\n\tBut international cotton prices have slumped so low that the  \nmoney ran out last December. \n\n\n\t``Because we're exporting to foreign markets, every farmer is  \nhurting,'' said Lloyd Brown, a spokesman for the state Department \nof Agriculture. ``There are some fruit and vegetable growers that \nare doing well, but most are doing badly.'' \n\n\n\tThis leaves farmers with few options, Brown said. They could try  \nraising pigs or planting wheat instead of cotton. But nothing is \ngoing to make them much more money. \n\n\n\tEvery Arizona cotton farm is in jeopardy, Murphy said. At 55 to  \n65 cents per pound, farmers can't make enough to pay for fuel or \nfinance their farms. \n\n\n\t``I know I'm crazy for planting cotton right now,'' said Murphy,  \nwho owns 600 acres of cotton fields in Marana. ``You need to get at \nleast 70 cents per pound to make ends meet.'' \n\n\n\t------\t \n\n\n\tYAKIMA, Wash. (AP) -- Take me out to the ballgame, buy me some  \npeanuts and Cracker Jack. \n\n\n\tOr how about a DunkApple?  \n\n\n\tThe Washington Apple Commission has signed a contract with the  \nSeattle Mariners to sell DunkApples -- sliced apples served with \ntubs of caramel -- when the new Safeco Field opens in July. \n\n\n\tGrowers are hoping to develop sports fans as a new market for  \napples. Eventually, the commission would like to introduce \nDunkApples at stadiums around the country. \n\n\n\t``There's nothing like it in the ball park. You're looking at  \nchips, hot dogs and nachos,'' said Kevin Bredesen, the commission's \ndirector of food service marketing in Wenatchee. \n\n\n\tThe commission has been looking for ways to increase domestic  \nconsumption of apples, a crop getting bigger in this state. Last \nyear, Washington growers harvested 100 million 43-pound boxes. \n\n\n\tDunkApples will sell for $2 to $3. The contracts with the  \nMariners and the team's concessionaire, Volume Services America, \ntake effect in July and extend through the 2000 season.",

      "content": "THE SHRIMP AND THE LOBSTER GET COMPETITION \n\n\n\n   NEW YORK _ Like many immigrants to the United States, the little\ncrustaceans known as langoustines have been arriving here in\ngreater numbers because of bad times elsewhere in the world.\n\n\n   These creatures, which look like sawed-off lobsters and taste a\nlittle like lobster and a little like shrimp, have long been a\ndelicacy in European restaurants but have played second fiddle to\nshrimp in the United States. Then along came Hurricane Mitch.\n\n\n   As it raged along the coasts of Central and South America last\nOctober, the storm wiped out hundreds of shrimp farms that supplied\nthe North American market. Within months of the devastation,\nparticularly in Ecuador and Honduras, shrimp from Asia started\nfilling in the gap. But in the interim, chefs and adventurous home\ncooks started asking fish suppliers for langoustines, and that\ndemand has not abated.\n\n\n   Luis Polcano, manager of the fish department at Balducci's in\nGreenwich Village, points out that before the hurricane,\nlangoustines cost $12.99 a pound and were not a big mover. After\nthe hurricane, when demand jumped, the price rose to $15.99, ``and\nI sell more and more every week,'' he said.\n\n\n   Like anything unfamiliar that is pushed into the limelight,\nlangoustines have to battle some misconceptions as to what they\nare. They are frequently confused with langoustes, or spiny\nlobsters, the slender, tough-shelled cousins of the American\nlobster. Langoustines are also often sold as prawns, though\nbiologically they are only distant cousins.\n\n\n   Most of them that are sold here come from waters off Iceland,\nNorway, the Brittany coast of France and New Zealand, though they\nare also caught in the Adriatic and the Mediterranean. Usually\nabout 7 inches long and about as wide as a fat thumb, langoustines\nhave narrow, elongated claws and shells as thick as hard-shelled\ncrabs. Their meat, which resides entirely in the 1- to 2-inch-long\ntail, is delicate but rich.\n\n\n   Unlike shrimp or lobster, langoustine meat begins to deteriorate\nimmediately after the creatures die, due to a bacteria underneath\nthe shells that breaks down the meat and turns it mushy, said Rod\nMitchell, the owner of Browne Trading Co., a seafood and caviar\nimporter in Portland, Maine. For this reason, whole langoustines\nare usually available only by special order; their tails are most\nfrequently sold cooked and frozen. Happily, the blue and brown\ncrustaceans, whose shells turn ruby red when cooked, lose little\nwhen frozen.\n\n\n   But because their flesh is extremely fragile and perishable,\nlangoustines can take only a short blast of high heat in a skillet,\nwok or on the grill. They can be treated like crayfish on the\nbayou, boiled in a spicy broth, chilled and eaten right from their\nshells. They can be sauteed with lots of garlic and tossed with\npasta and parsley, or marinated in olive oil and lemon and broiled\non kebobs.\n\n\n   Brushed with butter or olive oil and quickly turned on a very\nhot grill, langoustine tails remain moist and succulent, tasting\nsweet, faintly briny and buttery. They make a great warm-weather\nmeal.\n\n\n   But since langoustines arrived in the United States as a luxury\ngood, rather than as a huddled mass of cheap food, the crustaceans\nare finding a home in more elaborate, highly nuanced dishes. Marc\nMurphy, the chef of La Fourchette in Manhattan, balances the\nrichness of grilled langoustines by serving them with wilted\narugula and a sharp gazpacho sauce. In Boston, Lydia Shire, the\nchef and owner of Biba, uses langoustines as a delicate base note\nin mildly curried fritters that she serves with a sweet and sour\npeach chutney. Eric Ripert, the chef at Le Bernardin in New York,\nemphasizes the richness of the shellfish by using them in butter\nand cream sauces for mild white fish.\n\n\n   More than likely, any misunderstanding of langoustines will be\nshort-lived. Their sweet, succulent, delicate flavor is sure to\nmake them as much a commodity in the American kitchen as they have\nlong been in Europe.\n\n\n   GRILLED LANGOUSTINES WITH WILTED ARUGULA AND GA",

The floated carcasses of\ndrowned animals drifted slowly on the flood waters between tall\ntrees, as patient vultures circled above.\n\n\nMen, women and children carrying a few belongings on their\nheads, waded through the waist-high waters to safety.\n\n\nThe flooding has raised fears of disease. Last year,\nwater-borne diseases such as typhoid, cholera and diarrhoea swept\nacross the region, claiming scores of lives.\n\n\nThe lake supports some 25 million people, 10 million being in\nKenya, although it only holds about six percent of the lake's\n2,760 cubic km of water with Tanzania 49 percent and Uganda 45\npercent.\n\n\nThe floods have also sparked heated debate about its causes\nwith some experts arguing the phenomenon, last seen in early\n1960s, is mainly a result of siltation due to the blockage of\nriver estuaries by the hyacinth weed.\n\n\nThe blockage by water hyacinth forced silt deposits in the\nshallow sections of the lake, damming the rivers and causing\nfloods, says William Saina, an agricultural expert.\n\n\nHe attributed more siltation to destruction of trees and\ncultivation in water catchment areas in highlands near the Rift\nValley province.\n\n\nOn Sunday, a marine expert, Joseph Mucuthi, also said the\nhyacinth weed runs riot with roots and leaves having collected at\nthe bottom of the lake, making it shallower, hence the overflow.\n\n\nAnother reason is the shoreline \"which is now shrinking\ntowards the lake\" as it has not been surveyed for more than 50\nyears, Mucuthi said.\n\n\nHowever, Dr Geoffrey Howard of the International Union for\nConservation of Nature and Natural Resources said Monday the\nhyacinth invasion is an unlikely cause of the water rise as 92\npercent of the weed is water.\n\n\n\"Rainfall increase might be the cause, that is, if the totals\nare abnormally high as the one experienced in 1960,\" Howard said.\n\n\nWater hyacinth is likely to increase the rate of evaporation\nhence decreasing water levels, he argued.",

      "content": "A SMOKY PEPPER'S SEDUCTIVE POWER \n\n\n\n   Peppers release their heat in many ways, whether in a straight\ndrive like cayenne or a consuming explosion like a jalapeno. The\nAleppo pepper is more seductive, exuding a mellow, earthy warmth\nthat seems to expand rapidly, then slowly dissipate.\n\n\n   When sprinkled over roasted potatoes, the deep red waxy flakes\nof the Aleppo, a pepper that comes from Syria, do not just add\nflavor; they change the potatoes. Behind their pure nutty flavor,\nthere is smokiness and a little spice. With carrots, the pepper\nunderlines the vegetable's sweetness with its own raisin-like taste\n_ and that lingering heat. It is like paprika, but much more\ncomplex.\n\n\n   Aleppo refers to red peppers in the capsicum family that are\ngrown, partly dried and coarsely ground around the city of Aleppo.\nOther peppers from nearby regions look the same, but the Aleppo\nflavor is distinct, just as the flavor of prosciutto di Parma is\ndistinct from other cured pork.\n\n\n   As alluring as it is, Aleppo pepper has managed to elude most\nchefs and home cooks. Restaurants serving Syrian and other Middle\nEastern food, like Zaytoons in Brooklyn, Moustache in Greenwich\nVillage and Layla in TriBeCa, do not even use it.\n\n\n   And yet, the chefs who have discovered it can't seem to put it\ndown. Floyd Cardoz of Tabla uses Aleppo pepper in a number of\ndishes, often blended with cayenne and chilies from India and New\nMexico. Its mild, rich heat is in the pan-roasted lobster glazed\nwith Goan curry and in the tomato curry sauce served with a raviolo\nof spinach and sheep's milk ricotta. It even finds a place in a\nwarm Cheddar fondue with cumin.\n\n\n   Joyce Goldstein, a San Francisco chef who has written cookbooks,\nis another devotee of Aleppo pepper, and like Cardoz, she is not a\npurist about it. She often simply uses it in place of other dried\nred peppers for a richer, smokier aroma.\n\n\n   ``Anytime you have the choice of using hot paprika or a\npaprika-cayenne combination, that's the time to use it,'' she said.\n\n\n   Aleppo pepper is sold in most good spice shops, like Adriana's\nBazaar at Grand Central Market, (800) 316-0820, and Kalustyans, 123\nLexington Avenue, (212) 685-3416. It is also sold online at\nwww.worldspice.com. The price is usually around $2 an ounce.\n\n\n   A similar pepper called Maras comes from just over the border in\nTurkey. It looks the same as the Aleppo _ bright red, flaked and\nmoist from a small addition of salt _ but is a tad hotter. Urfa,\nalso from Turkey, is darker and smokier, with a deeper, dried-fruit\naroma. Sometimes these peppers are not even packaged with specific\nnames. Maras and Aleppo may simply be labeled Middle Eastern\npepper.\n\n\n   Aleppo is used in a spread called muhammara, in which the coarse\npowder is diluted in oil and water, then mixed with bread crumbs,\nground walnuts, lemon juice and pomegranate syrup, and eaten like\nhummus, with flatbread. It is also used to season meat fillings,\nlegumes and salads.\n\n\n   But you can use it like any other dried red pepper. It can be\nsprinkled over sweet potatoes with a little coarse sea salt and\nolive oil before roasting them. Aleppo blends well with other\nspices, too, like toasted and ground cumin and coriander for\ncoating pieces of carrot before roasting or braising. The light,\nthin flakes cling well to vegetables, fish and meats and work well\nwith other spices as rubs or in marinades.\n\n\n   Aleppo's sweetness and soft heat is especially good with sweet\nvegetables like tomatoes and eggplant. One way to see this is to\nchar eggplants and puree them while warm with garlic, olive oil and\nlemon juice, adding a touch of Aleppo at the end. The pepper\nunderscores the smokiness of the eggplant.\n\n\n   As Cardoz points out, Aleppo has one quality that few other\ndried red peppers have: you can add it to a finished dish and not\nworry about the sharpness overwhelming it. ``If you add almost any\nother chili pepper at the end of cooking, it hits you in the\nthroat,'' he said.\n\n\n   Aleppo has a roasted, finished flavor, so you can simmer white\nbeans with onion, garlic and herbs, then",

      "content": "THREE-BEAN SALAD \n\n\n\n   I've named this salad after those crocks of marinated green\nbeans, garbanzo and kidney beans in every American salad bar. But\nmy three-bean salad is really something entirely different, a\nsimple composition of dried beans and fresh beans: a base of pureed\nwhite beans is infused with truffle oil, topped with a mixture of\nfresh beans in a vinaigrette and finished with field greens or\nfresh herbs.\n\n\n   The key to success is your bean technique. Dried beans must be\nproperly rehydrated and then gently simmered, never boiled. If you\nboil the heck out of beans, they tend to explode. Soaking them in\nwarm water and then gradually bringing the cooking liquid up to a\ngentle heat insures even cooking and intact beans. Add salt toward\nthe end of cooking rather than at the beginning, or it will inhibit\nrehydration.\n\n\n   The salad works well with any fresh beans _ Blue Lake, haricots\nverts, yellow wax, fava, lima or cranberry beans, to name some\npossibilities _ cooked until they are firm but give no resistance\nto the teeth. To cook fresh beans _ or any green vegetable, for\nthat matter _ I use a technique I call big-pot blanching: cook your\nvegetable in so much water that the water does not lose its boil\nwhen you add the vegetables. Your water should be heavily salted,\nabout a half cup for each gallon. The result is a vegetable of the\nbrightest possible color.\n\n\n   If you've cooked your beans properly, you almost can't go wrong\nwith this salad. Feel free to experiment with the vinaigrette: wine\nvinegars (sherry, red or Champagne) or balsamic are good choices. I\nlove to serve it throughout the summer when we have abundant\nvarieties of ``fresh from the garden'' beans. It's seasonal,\nelegant and fun _ an interpretation of a salad bar standard that's\nworthy, I think, of haute cuisine. &QL; \n &QL; \nTHREE-BEAN SALAD  &QL;\n\n\n   Time: 2 hours, plus overnight soaking of beans  &QL; \n &QL;\n\n\n   1 cup dried marrow beans or other white beans, soaked in 4 cups\nwater at room temperature overnight\n\n\n   5 cups plus 2 tablespoons vegetable stock or canned vegetable\nbroth\n\n\n   1 shallot, peeled and halved, plus 1 teaspoon minced\n\n\n   1 small carrot, peeled\n\n\n   Bouquet garni: 3 sprigs parsley, 1 sprig thyme and 1 bay leaf,\nwrapped in two 5-inch sections of leek greens and tied with string\n\n\n   Kosher salt and freshly ground white pepper\n\n\n   4 to 5 tablespoons white truffle oil\n\n\n   2 teaspoons sherry wine vinegar\n\n\n   1 cup trimmed haricots verts in 1-inch pieces\n\n\n   1 cup trimmed yellow wax beans in 1-inch pieces\n\n\n   { cup shelled, peeled fava beans\n\n\n   1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil\n\n\n   1 teaspoon lemon juice\n\n\n   2 cups frisee or baby greens, for garnish.\n\n\n   1 tablespoon peeled, seeded, diced tomatoes\n\n\n   1. Prepare the bean puree: Drain the white beans. In a large\nsaucepan or casserole, combine the beans with 4 cups of water.\nPlace over low heat, and bring to a simmer. Remove from the heat,\nand allow the beans to rest for 5 minutes. Remove any beans that\nfloat to the surface. Drain, and chill under cold running water.\nReturn the beans to the saucepan, and add 5 cups of the vegetable\nstock, shallot halves, carrot and bouquet garni. Place over low\nheat, and simmer for 20 minutes.\n\n\n   2. Add \\ teaspoon salt, and continue to cook until the beans are\ncompletely tender, 25 to 30 minutes. There should still be some\nliquid remaining in the pan. Place a strainer over a bowl, and\ndrain the beans, reserving the liquid. Remove and discard the\ncarrot and bouquet garni. Using a food processor, begin to puree\nthe beans. With the machine running, slowly add the reserved liquid\nthrough the feed tube, adding just enough to make a smooth puree.\nNext, pass the puree through a tamis or drum sieve. Measure 1 cup\nof puree into a mixing bowl, and set aside the remainder for\nanother use. Whisk in the remaining 2 tablespoons vegetable stock,\n2 tablespoons of the truffle oil and 1 teaspoon of the vinegar. The\npuree should have a creamy consistency; add 1 more tablespoon of\ntruffle oil if desired. Season to taste with salt and pepper.",

But\nwith well-planned cooking sessions on Sunday afternoon, you can\nenjoy big, family-style Sunday dinners and then some fast and\nfabulous meals during the week. Taking a cue from a new cookbook,\n``Cooking for the Week,'' by Diane Morgan, Dan Taggart and Kathleen\nTaggart (Chronicle Books, $18.95), we offer a menu here for a month\nof Sundays, and all the days in between.\n\n\n   JAN. 30\n\n\n   Spaghetti and meatballs\n\n\n   Make double batches of spicy tomato sauce and meatloaf mixture.\nPut half the meatloaf in a loaf pan, wrap tightly and freeze until\nmidweek. With the remaining, make meatballs. Combine with sauce and\nspaghetti and you'll have a Super Bowl crowd-pleaser. Put one quart\nof sauce in the refrigerator and two quarts in the freezer.\n\n\n   JAN. 31\n\n\n   Meatball subs\n\n\n   Take leftover meatballs and nest them in hoagie rolls. Spoon\ntomato sauce over the meatballs and then blanket with slices of\nmozzarella cheese. Wrap each sandwich with aluminum foil and heat\nin a 400 degree oven for about 10 minutes.\n\n\n   February\n\n\n   1Vegetarian pizza\n\n\n   Take Sunday's tomato sauce, thicken it with a bit of tomato\npaste or spice it up with an extra dash of crushed red pepper.\nSpread on a homemade or store-bought pizza crust, top with\nmushrooms, chopped green pepper and chopped onion (or your other\nfavorite veggies), sprinkle with mozzarella cheese and bake.\n\n\n   2 Meatloaf\n\n\n   and mashed potatoes\n\n\n   Tonight, bake the meatloaf. While it's cooking, make a hearty\nportion of mashed potatoes (you want leftovers). As soon as the\nmeatloaf comes out of the oven, put trimmed asparagus on a cookie\nsheet, drizzle with olive oil, sprinkle with salt and stick under\nthe broiler for 4 minutes. Heat some tomato sauce to spoon over the\nmeatloaf.\n\n\n   3Potato cakes\n\n\n   and green salad\n\n\n   Combine 2 cups mashed potatoes with one large beaten egg. Stir\nin 6 tablespoons of flour. Add 1 1/2 tablespoons of grated onion,\n1/2 teaspoon dried marjoram, salt and pepper to taste. Drop by\nheaping spoonfuls into a heavy skillet with 1/8-inch of hot\nvegetable oil. Flatten with spoon and fry on each side for 1\nminute. Top with poached egg if desired. Serve with green salad.\n\n\n   4Shrimp braised in oil\n\n\n   Cookbook author Mark Bittman calls this a flavor bath. Combine\n1/3 cup olive oil and 4 cloves of sliced garlic in a 10-inch\nskillet over medium heat. When the garlic begins to sizzle, add 1\nteaspoon each of cumin and paprika. Increase heat to medium-high\nand add 2 pounds of medium shrimp. Stir and cook until shrimp are\npink. Serve over rice.\n\n\n   5 Pork chops, macaroni\n\n\n   and cheese and spinach\n\n\n   For a comfy Saturday night feast, make macaroni and cheese in a\nlarge casserole dish (save half for Sunday). Broil or fry some pork\nchops and steam some spinach.\n\n\n   6 Roast chicken\n\n\n   Roast two chickens (save one), steam two bunches of broccoli\n(save one); reheat mac and cheese. Make a double recipe of your\nfavorite drop biscuit recipe with 1/2 cup of chopped fresh herbs\n(put 8 in the freezer). Finish with raspberry ice cream: Puree 2\n(10-ounce) packs of frozen raspberries, 2 cups of cream and 1/4 cup\nof confectioners' sugar. Freeze 2 hours.\n\n\n   7 Biscuit-topped chicken pie\n\n\n   Remember the chicken pot pies of yore? Here's a quickie version\nthat's delicious. Combine chopped chicken with carrots, mushrooms\nand a cream sauce. Pour into a casserole dish and top with the\nleftover herbed biscuits. Heat and eat.\n\n\n   8 Linguine with broccoli\n\n\n   Toss some linguine with olive oil, steamed broccoli from Sunday\nand crumbled blue cheese. For an extra layer of flavor, add toasted\npecans. Simply spread pecans on a baking sheet and heat at 350\ndegrees for 5-7 minutes. Serve with a crisp white wine.\n\n\n   9 Asian chicken salad\n\n\n   Toss together shredded green lettuce, chicken chunks, broken\nRamen noodles",

      "content": "THICK, CRUSTY LAMB CHOPS \n\n\n\n   When I was growing up, one of my favorite dishes was leg of\nlamb. It was a festive dish, one that my grandmother, who was from\nLebanon, made whenever we all gathered for a family celebration.\nShe would braise a whole leg with olives and lemon, and those\nflavors, so wonderfully Mediterranean, are one of my earliest taste\nmemories. When I think of lamb, that dish instantly comes to mind.\n\n\n   I wanted to recreate it at the restaurant, but I needed to cook\nsmaller portions, so they could be roasted to order, and I wanted\nto expand on the flavors just a bit.\n\n\n   I switched to thick triple lamb chops, because they are tender\nenough to endure the kind of heat needed to get a nice crust. And\nstill thinking Mediterranean, I hit on the idea of adding capers\nand anchovy to the olive-lemon marinade, making it almost a\ntapenade.\n\n\n   All these strong, salty ingredients may sound like a very\nintense combination, but they really mellow as the lamb is roasted.\n(We use a wood-burning oven, but a regular oven at a very high heat\nwill give most of the same results.)\n\n\n   It's important to marinate the lamb at least four hours. During\nthat time, it is actually curing a little bit from the salt in the\nolives, capers and anchovy. (You might notice that the marinade\ndoesn't call for any added salt; it just doesn't need it.) A mild\ncuring makes meat a little more tender, but more important, it\ntakes out water and concentrates fat, almost like dry aging. In the\nend the chop has a moister and less grainy quality.\n\n\n   At the very end of cooking, I deglaze the pan with wine, lemon\njuice and stock (we use lamb stock, but you can use chicken or beef\nbroth), then toss in some thinly sliced lemons and more olives.\n\n\n   The liquids quickly reduce and form a simple sauce. The lemon\nslices and olives, which get nicely charred in the heat, add a\nfinal burst of flavor and look beautiful on the plate. To keep the\nMediterranean mood, serve the chops with couscous or grilled\nvegetables. A bright sprinkling of chopped parsley is all the\ngarnish you'll need.\n\n\n   ROASTED TRIPLE LAMB CHOPS WITH OLIVES AND LEMON\n\n\n   Time: 30 minutes, plus 4 hours to marinate\n\n\n   One-third cup extra virgin olive oil\n\n\n   3 tablespoons black oil-cured olives, pitted\n\n\n   1 tablespoon capers\n\n\n   2 teaspoons chopped parsley, plus extra for garnish\n\n\n   1 teaspoon chopped garlic\n\n\n   1 teaspoon chopped shallot\n\n\n   \\ teaspoon ground cumin\n\n\n   1 anchovy fillet\n\n\n   Freshly ground black pepper to taste\n\n\n   4 8-ounce, 3-bone racks of lamb, Frenched by butcher\n\n\n   1 lemon\n\n\n   \\ cup white wine\n\n\n   \\ cup chicken stock\n\n\n   1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice.\n\n\n   1. In a food processor, combine olive oil, 1 tablespoon olives,\ncapers, parsley, garlic, shallot, cumin, anchovy and pepper. Coat\nlamb with this marinade, and place in a bowl. Cover, and\nrefrigerate at least 4 hours, or overnight.\n\n\n   2. Thinly slice lemon and remove seeds. Cut slices into\nquarters. Reserve.\n\n\n   3. Preheat oven to 500 degrees. Arrange racks of lamb in a\nroasting pan large enough to hold them in one layer (or use two\npans). Drizzle any marinade left in bottom of bowl over lamb. Roast\nlamb 7 minutes.\n\n\n   4. Transfer lamb to a plate. Pour off fat from roasting pan, and\nadd white wine, chicken stock and lemon juice. Return lamb to pan,\nbrowned side down. Sprinkle lamb with remaining olives and lemon\nslices. Roast 7 to 9 minutes more, or to taste. Garnish with\nchopped parsley, and serve.\n\n\n   Yield: 4 servings.",

Whatever the source of\nthis inferiority complex, the truth is that sauces aren't all that\ndifficult to make.\n\n\n   Consider that most sauces are made of just a very few basic\ningredients that most people already have on hand. Butter, flour or\nother thickening agents, spices and maybe wine are the simple basis\nfor scores of sauces. Yes, there are blending and thickening\ntechniques that you'll have to master, but compared with some other\nculinary procedures, those are fairly simple.\n\n\n   Nothing can transform the ho-hum into the unforgettable more\nquickly than a sauce. And to deprive your repertoire of sauces is\nto miss out on one of the most creative things you can do in the\nkitchen. Remember, too, that the French haven't cornered the market\non sauces. Nearly every nation and region in the world has a\nsignature sauce, making the creative opportunities nearly\nunlimited.\n\n\n   If you're moved to give up those powder-filled envelopes you've\nbeen relying on to jazz up your cooking and are game to enter the\ncreative world of sauces, check out these World Wide Web sites for\nan informative overview.\n\n\n   &QR;  At www.gumbopages.com/food/sauces/ you will learn, in simple\nlanguage, about such things as ``mother sauces'' and their\nderivatives.

      "content": "LOW-HEAT OVEN SLOWLY BRINGS OUT THE GOODNESS IN FRUITS \n\n\n\n   NEW YORK _ For some years now, I have been using low, dry heat\nto add intense flavor to tomatoes or to make sweet root-vegetable\nchips. I simply put the vegetables in a very low oven and let them\nlaze away as the moisture is slowly drawn out and the sugars become\ncaramelized and profoundly sweet.\n\n\n   Recently, to add a little distinction to some of the more common\nfruits that I use in desserts, condiments, salads or garnishes, I\nbegan experimenting with this oven-drying technique to bring out\ntheir inherent syrupy goodness. After some fits and starts, I think\nthat I perfected the method.\n\n\n   At the restaurant, we have been turning out ambrosial, lightly\ndried peaches, plums and nectarines as they hit the height of their\nripeness this summer. With fall approaching, we began drying\nheirloom apples and pears with just as much success.\n\n\n   Drying fruit (or vegetables) at home is just as easy. Any type\nof oven will do: gas, electric or convection.\n\n\n   If you are in no hurry _ and if you have an oven setting of less\nthan 200 degrees, which is usually marked ``warm'' _ use that\nsetting and let the fruit dry for up to 12 hours. If 200 degrees is\nyour lowest setting, dry the fruit for no longer than 6 hours. The\nlarger the pieces, the moister the fruit (or vegetable) will\nremain.\n\n\n   Simply place the pieces on baking sheets lined with parchment\npaper, leaving at least an inch around each one, and put the sheets\nin a low oven. Take a peek from time to time; the drying is done\nwhen the edges begin to curl, the flesh begins to firm up and the\ncenter is still very soft. Or just taste the fruit as it dries, and\nremove it when it reaches the intensity you like.\n\n\n   For this fall salad, the pears are only lightly dried. They\nretain a great deal of their moisture, and their sugar takes on\njust a hint of caramel. To add an even greater depth of flavor, I\nmarinate them in port and ginger before sending them off for a long\nbask.\n\n\n   COMPOSED SALAD OF RED OAK-LEAF LETTUCE, FENNEL, OVEN-DRIED\nPEARS, TOASTED WALNUTS AND MAYTAG BLUE CHEESE\n\n\n   Time: 2 hours 15 minutes, including 2 hours marinating and\ndrying\n\n\n   6 Comice pears\n\n\n   1 cup port wine\n\n\n   3 tablespoons light brown sugar\n\n\n   1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger\n\n\n   { cup extra virgin olive oil\n\n\n   3 tablespoons fine quality, well-aged balsamic vinegar\n\n\n   Coarse salt and freshly cracked black pepper to taste\n\n\n   2 medium fennel bulbs\n\n\n   2 heads red oak-leaf lettuce, well washed, dried and pulled\napart\n\n\n   { cup toasted walnut pieces (if available, black walnuts add an\ninteresting note)\n\n\n   4 ounces Maytag Blue Cheese.\n\n\n   1. Peel pears, cut them in half lengthwise, and carefully remove\ncore and stem.\n\n\n   2. Combine port, brown sugar and ginger in a shallow baking\ndish. Add pear halves, cut-side down, and spoon port mixture over\nthem. Cover with plastic film and marinate for 1 hour, turning from\ntime to time.\n\n\n   3. Preheat oven to 200 degrees. Place marinated pears on a\nparchment paper-lined baking sheet in the oven, and dry for about 1\nhour or until pears are just beginning to firm but remain moist in\nthe center.\n\n\n   4. Whisk together the olive oil and vinegar. Season to taste\nwith salt and cracked black pepper. Wash and trim the fennel bulbs.\nCut bulbs in half lengthwise, then cut fennel lengthwise into very\nthin slices.\n\n\n   5. Beginning at the wide end, cut each half of pear lengthwise,\ndown to but not through the stem end.\n\n\n   6. Toss lettuce and fennel together. Add a small amount of\ndressing, and toss to combine. Place equal portions of the dressed\nmixture on each of six luncheon plates. Fan two pear halves across\nthe greens, overlapping the stem ends. Sprinkle a few walnut pieces\naround the edges of the plates. Crumble an equal portion of the\ncheese over each plate. Drizzle a bit of the remaining dressing\nover the top, and serve.\n\n\n   Yield: 6 servings.",

      "content": "The vegetables are loaded not just with useful fiber and\nvitamins (A and C), but they've got phytochemicals, sulforaphane,\nindoles _ all compounds that are believed to fight everything from\ncolon and breast cancer to Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\n   So if broccoli, cauliflower and their various cousins in the\nvegetable patch are life-enhancers, are they even more so when\ngrown organically?\n\n\n   Yes, according to the people at Warren Weber's Star Route Farm\nin Bolinas. They believe their organic crops are not only healthier\nbut that they taste better than their conventionally grown\ncounterparts.\n\n\n   ``That's what customers tell us,'' says production manager\nDouglas Gallagher.\n\n\n   The consumer feedback is an advantage of entering the farmers'\nmarket business, which the 25-year-old Star Route Farm did this\nyear, making its products more widely available to consumers who\nincreasingly ask for organic produce.\n\n\n   Fifteen years ago, Gallagher says, Star Route's 40 acres _\nsupplemented by twice that acreage at its satellite farm in the\nCoachella Valley of Southern California _ would have been\nconsidered large for an organic operation. Now, he says, the\noperation is small fish in an expanding pond, as many large-scale\nfarms jump on the organic bandwagon.\n\n\n   The reasons include greater consumer awareness as well as the\ndevelopment of natural pest-fighting products and fertilizers,\nwhich can be applied with conventional machinery. ``You don't have\nto make your own compost any more,'' Gallagher points out.\n\n\n   Still, Star Route relies heavily on a natural crop cycle to\nmaintain its soil and guarantee healthy and plentiful future crops.\nAs soon as the last broccoli and cauliflower are harvested _ in a\nfew more weeks _ the Bolinas fields will be planted with clover and\nother cover crops that get plowed under in the spring. Star Route's\nrestaurant and retail customers will then receive essentially the\nsame crops (broccoli, lettuces, herbs, flowers and root vegetables)\nfrom the Coachella Valley farm, which, in turn, converts to cover\ncrops for the hot summer months.\n\n\n   Gallagher says Star Route's location on a flood plain is ideal\nfor cool-weather lovers like broccoli. The heavy soil (technically,\nblucher loam) isn't well suited for root vegetables, but the\ncrucifers thrive here from spring to fall _ even into mid-winter if\nit's a dry year.\n\n\n   Competition from large farms that have switched to organic\npractices _ some as far away as Arizona and Mexico _ may benefit\nconsumers by driving prices down, but it's obviously a concern for\nsmall operations.\n\n\n   Weber and Gallagher are part of a group of west Marin growers\nwho are working with the county's Agricultural Commissioner's\nOffice to create a Marin organic label to promote the use of\nlocally grown produce.\n\n\n   Support from trend-setting restaurateurs who want their produce\nnot only fresh and natural but locally grown if at all feasible, is\na boon to farms like Star Route. Plus, it helps to be virtually in\nthe backyard of a metropolis.\n\n\n   ``We can drive to Ferry Plaza (site of a Saturday farmers'\nmarket) in an hour,'' says Gallagher, so the distance, and time,\nfrom field to table are about as short as they can get.",

      "content": "A TWO-DAY MARINADE GIVES ZEST TO SEA BASS \n\n\n\n   If cooking is as much alchemy as chemistry, here is the dish to\nprove it: Chilean sea bass metamorphosed by a two-day submersion in\na miso marinade, then broiled until it is as brown and shiny as a\nperfectly barbecued rib.\n\n\n   Two days is a long time to marinate anything, particularly fish,\nbut it takes that long for the marinade to work its magic. It is a\nblend of orange juice and zest, brown sugar, sake, a light miso\npaste and the pungent chili paste called sambal oelek.\n\n\n   Chilean sea bass, which is actually Patagonian tooth fish,\nstarts out as what I call a Jell-O fish: its flesh is soft, wet and\noily. Steam it and its texture will remind you of soft-boiled eggs.\nBut cover it with the marinade and all that changes, strikingly.\n\n\n   The marinade's salts and sugars act as a cure and turn the soft\nfish into one that flakes in large, firm shards. Marinated, the\nChilean sea bass comes to resemble cod, but creamier and richer.\n\n\n   And after two days, it is not just the texture that changes. The\nfish is imbued with the salty, sweet, bitter, acidic flavors,\ncomplexity and exotic richness of the marinade's ingredients, many\nof them rooted in the traditional cooking of Japan, and all of them\nintensified when the fish is cooked.\n\n\n   I top the glazed fillets with cilantro leaves and surround them\nwith a salad of mango and scallion greens splashed with a citrusy\ndressing, an integral part of the dish.\n\n\n   The fish calls for the coolness and sharpness of the salad and\nits dressing, whose flavors are haunting but immediately appealing.\nThe crisp citrus taste in the dressing comes from the\ncitrus-flavored soy sauce called ajipon, and from yuzu kosho, a\nchili paste that includes yuzu, a Japanese citrus fruit prized for\nthe oils in its skin. To pull the flavors into balance, I add\nmirin, a sweet Japanese rice wine, and rice wine vinegar.\n\n\n   You may have to make a few shopping trips to collect the\ningredients for this dish, but I promise you they will be worth\nit. &QL; \n &QL;\n\n\n   MISO-GLAZED CHILEAN SEA BASS &QL;\n\n\n   Time: 40 minutes, plus 2 days for marinating the fillets &QL; \n &QL;\n\n\n   2 oranges\n\n\n   1 cup freshly squeezed orange juice\n\n\n   { cup light-brown sugar\n\n\n   } cup sake\n\n\n   1\\ cups light miso paste (see note)\n\n\n   1 tablespoon sambal oelek chili paste (see note)\n\n\n   6 skinless fillets of Chilean sea bass, each about 7 ounces\n\n\n   \\ cup ajipon (see note)\n\n\n   \\ cup mirin (see note)\n\n\n   \\ cup seasoned rice vinegar\n\n\n   \\ cup soybean oil\n\n\n   1 teaspoon yuzu kosho (see note)\n\n\n   1 tablespoon vegetable oil\n\n\n   2 carrots, peeled and finely shredded\n\n\n   { daikon, peeled and finely shredded\n\n\n   2 teaspoons soy sauce\n\n\n   1 ripe mango, peeled, pitted and cut into short, thin strips\n\n\n   3 scallions, green parts only, thinly sliced diagonally\n\n\n   6 sprigs cilantro, leaves only. &QL; \n &QL;\n\n\n   1.

      "content": "RECONSIDERING THE RADISH: NEW WAYS TO TAME ITS BITE \n\n\n\n   Radishes have been cultivated for so long that they actually\npredate written history. By the time Confucius wrote about them in\nthe fifth century B.C., they were a staple crop in Asia.\n\n\n   Today, radishes turn up in Mexican, Indian, Chinese, Japanese,\nThai, North African, French, Italian and Russian cookbooks, but\nthey are barely on the culinary radar in this country.\n\n\n   In France roasted radishes are a delicious addition to a\nvegetable ragout with carrots and white beans. In Japan, radishes\nare braised in dashi, sake and soy sauce as a bracing side dish for\nfish or meat. In India, shredded radishes are seasoned with\nchilies, ginger and toasted spices to make a filling for paratha.\n\n\n   Even when used raw, radishes get better treatment elsewhere. In\nMexico, they are paired with avocado and lime juice in a simple\nsalad of contrasting flavors and textures. Greek restaurants offer\nsliced radishes with fennel for scooping a feta cheese dip.\n\n\n   Radishes are thought to have been cultivated in Europe since the\nlate Stone Age. The ancient Egyptians grew them for the oil that\ncould be pressed from the seeds.\n\n\n   Despite this history, Americans barely bother with radishes.\nAlthough the consumption of fresh vegetables is on the rise over\nall in the United States, sales of radishes have actually declined\nslightly.\n\n\n   ``There's so much pressure to get exotic fruits and vegetables\non store shelves that the radish is being squeezed out a bit,''\nsaid Ron Schut, the president of Miedema Produce in Hudsonville,\nMich., one of the country's largest radish wholesalers.\n\n\n   This is surprising considering that radishes are available\nyear-round, with local supplies in summer and crops from Florida\nand Arizona in colder months. And specialty radishes are turning up\nmore often. Farmers' markets this time of year sell every type,\nfrom dainty French breakfast radishes, elongated versions that\nshade from bright red at the stem end to white at the root, to the\nsturdy daikon, which can grow to a foot or more and weigh more than\ntwo pounds.\n\n\n   Then there are the very mild Easter egg radishes, which come in\nvarious shades of red, pink, purple and ivory. Icicle radishes are\nwhite like the daikon but much smaller, usually about the size and\nshape of your thumb.\n\n\n   Any of these are good raw, with a little salt or butter, eaten\nout of hand or on bread. But cooking literally transforms them,\neliminating any pepperiness. When braised for 10 minutes, even the\nhottest radish loses its sting. What's left is pure radish flavor.\n\n\n   As an added bonus, the alabaster flesh of the standard red\nradish turns rosy pink. Pairing radishes with sauteed shallots and\na drop of honey actually makes them taste sweet.\n\n\n   Like other root vegetables, radishes also take well to roasting.\nRadishes emerge caramelized and tender from a hot oven. Tossing the\nradishes with a little soy sauce as they finish cooking creates a\nsyrupy glaze and seasons them perfectly. &QL;\n\n\n   Raw radishes are often as peppery as a chili, especially in\nsummer. The heat comes from mustard oils, or isothiocyanates, not\ncapsaicin, the fiery substance in chilies.\n\n\n   Mustard oils, compounds that provide flavor and aroma, are found\nin varying amounts in all cruciferous vegetables, a family that, in\naddition to radishes, also includes kale, broccoli, cabbage and\nturnips. Isothiocyanates are most prevalent in radishes,\nhorseradish, mustard greens and turnips.\n\n\n   Dr. Jeffrey Brecht, a professor of postharvest physiology at the\nUniversity of Florida in Gainesville, said the compounds are\nvolatile and their effect lasts only a few seconds. ``Cooking\ndrives off the isothiocyanates very quickly,'' he said.\n\n\n   Even raw radishes can be tamed, though. Try mixing several cups\nof sliced radishes with chopped oranges, a little extra virgin\nolive oil and some paprika to make a juicy Moroccan salad, perfect\nwith grilled fish or chicken, or with sandwiches at lunch.\n\n\n   If you have an hour or so, turn radishes into quick\nAsian-flavored pickles",

And there's no better way to do\nit than with a kebab sampling.\n\n\n   You can make the portions on each kebab as small or as large as\nyou'd like. And feel free to create your own combinations, pairing\nfavorite meats with preferred veggies or even fruits, like prunes,\nfigs, apricots and peaches.\n\n\n   There are really only a few rules to keep in mind. It's good if\nyou can intersperse lean meat cubes with fatty, and cut pieces\nabout the same size so they will cook evenly. When using different\nvegetables on the same skewer, make sure they have similar cooking\ntimes; longer-cooking vegetables may be blanched first to start the\ncooking.\n\n\n   Experiment with different skewers, metal or wood. You can\nusually find economical versions at grocery and discount stores.\nThe latest Williams-Sonoma catalog offers stainless steel skewers\nadorned with brass handles in the shape of animals. A set of six is\n$15.\n\n\n   If you use wood skewers, soak them in water for about an hour\nbefore using to keep them from burning while on the grill. You can\nalso wrap the ends in foil. It's also a good idea to grease the\ngrilling grate generously to prevent sticking.\n\n\n   One trick: Use a kebab rack. These stand about 2 inches high,\nand you place the skewers on top so they are just above the grate,\nbut not touching it. We spotted one at Stein Mart for $14.99.\n\n\n   Finally, the last trick to kebabs is the unskewering. As he\ntraveled the world sampling kebabs, cookbook author Steven Raichlen\ndiscovered the best way to handle this dilemma.\n\n\n   He suggests holding a skewer with one hand, and then, with a\npiece of thick bread in the other, pull the meat toward you a bit\nto loosen; everything should just slide off.\n\n\n   Below, we give you a few of the international recipes Raichlen\ndiscovered while working on ``The Barbecue!

      "content": "&UR;  &QL;  &LR; \n &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;  Before it was Silicon Valley, it was the Valley of\nHeart's Delight.\n\n   Eight million fruit trees blanketed Santa Clara County in the\nlate 1940s, creating what Wallace Stegner once described as\n``springs that were Milky Ways of blossom.''\n\n\n   Today those fruit trees have all but vanished, ripped out and\nreplaced by houses, shopping malls, office buildings and high-tech\ncampuses. Like family farms throughout the Bay Area, Santa Clara's\nfarms couldn't compete with the development needs of a rapidly\ngrowing urban area. Although some observers cite the rise of\nfarmers' markets as a positive omen for Bay Area farms in the\nfuture, no one suggests that the region will ever revert to its\nsemi-agrarian past.\n\n\n   Yvonne Olson Jacobson, whose family grew cherries and apricots\nin Sunnyvale along El Camino Real, remembers a childhood spent in\nand under the trees.\n\n\n   ``My father would drive his truck into the orchard to get\nbuckets of cherries from the pickers,'' she recalls. ``And if it\nwas a hot day, you had the opportunity to ride under the cool\ntrees. They were so big and leafy, and you were underneath all\nthose luscious cherries, and you could just reach up and pick them\noff.''\n\n\n   Last month, 100 years after the Olson family began farming in\nSunnyvale, bulldozers ripped out almost half of the family's\nremaining 24 acres. In a scene indicative of the past 50 years and\nthe foreseeable future for Bay Area agriculture, 300 apartment\nbuildings and a large retail complex will sprout on the site.\n\n\n   &LR; ``I was depressed awhile back,'' admits Deborah Olson,\nJacobson's niece who has maintained the Olson farmstand and\nmarketed the fruit in recent years. ``We have pictures, but now I'm\ngoing to have to say, `That's what it was. It was a ranch, and it's\nno longer going to be a ranch.' &LR;   &LR; ''\n\n\n   &LR; The Olsons are among the last holdouts from the days when El\nCamino Real was a country road surrounded by 125,000 acres of\norchards and vineyards. As Silicon Valley grew, creating demand for\nhousing and highways, farmers like the Olsons found their options\neroding.\n\n\n   They could sell to developers and start over in the Central\nValley, as many did. Or they could try to survive on fewer and\nfewer acres, as cities swallowed up their property for road\nexpansions. In the face of these pressures, the county's orchard\nand vineyard land has dwindled to 5,000 acres.\n\n\n   Farther north, San Mateo County has witnessed a century of\ndrastic change, too.\n\n\n   ``Serramonte Shopping Center was the biggest hog ranch in the\ncounty,'' says Jack Olsen, a San Mateo County Farm Bureau employee.\nAccording to the 1940 crop report, the county had 60,000 hogs and\n16,000 acres of vegetables _ mostly peas, artichokes, Brussels\nsprouts and lettuce.\n\n\n   ``This was the breadbasket for San Francisco,'' Olsen adds.\n``All the products had to be grown locally because you couldn't\nship halfway around the world like you can today.'' Olsen says a\n1920s photo on display in Daly City's Seton Medical Center shows\nall of Colma and Daly City in cabbage fields.\n\n\n   Today, the county can claim only 900 hogs and 3,300 acres of\nvegetables, but also 19 million square feet of greenhouses. Flowers\nand nursery plants now account for more than 75 percent of the\ncounty's agricultural production.\n\n\n   The population explosion following World War II sealed the fate\nof many San Mateo-area farms, says Mitch Postel, executive director\nof the San Mateo County Historical Museum. Many farmers took\nadvantage of rising land prices to cash out. But surprisingly, the\ncounty's remaining agriculture bears the mark of a much earlier\ninfluence: the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882.\n\n\n   The ban on Chinese immigration created a void on\nturn-of-the-century farms. Who would do the manual labor?\nEventually, Italian and Japanese immigrants replaced the Chinese\nand introduced the crops that prevail today. The Italians started\nsmall truck farms, planting artichokes, peas, fava beans, dandelion\ngreens, cauliflower, spinach and chard. The Japanese too",

      "content": "JOHNSON TRADE IS STRIKE THREE ON SAD DAY FOR MARINERS \n\n\n\n   SEATTLE _ The night had the lose-lose-lose feel of those Mariner\nseasons of the '80s at the Kingdome _ only lots more people and no\nSteve Trout.\n\n\n   Earlier Friday, the Mariners lost the longest game in Kingdome\nhistory, a 9-8 series-sweeping, soul-crusher to the Cleveland\nIndians. They left 20 men on base over 17 innings. Two more and\nthey could played the Seahawks here next weekend.\n\n\n   In the evening, they had to face the New York Yankees, a team so\npowerful they have applied for a seat on United Nations Security\nCouncil.\n\n\n   But most significantly, they had a lose-lose situation with\nRandy Johnson and the trading deadline. As the excruciating hours\ndwindled down, the silence that enveloped the franchise seemed to\nsignal that the club had no shot at doing anything that would be\nperceived as a win.\n\n\n   They weren't going to get full value for one of the most\ndominating pitchers in the game. And if he were not traded,\nmanagement would perpetuate the stink that has hung over this club\nsince Opening Day, as well as create the impression the aroma will\ncontinue once Johnson leaves as a free agent after the season with\nnothing in return.\n\n\n   So after nine months of holding Johnson, the club and its fans\nhostage to its aimlessness, management finally ended the saga _ but\nnot the controversy.\n\n\n   They traded the biggest Unit to the Houston Astros for two\ndiminutive units _ a minor league pitcher and a minor league\ninfielder, each of whom are known primarily by their mothers, a few\nscouts and a couple of Houston barbecue joints.\n\n\n   Also included is a player to be named. If it is Jeff Bagwell,\nmanagement is off the hook. Since it won't be, the Mariners have\nkissed off the 1998 season.\n\n\n   While hardly an unusual move in baseball, the abandonment of the\nrace at the trading deadline is the first here since people started\ncaring about the team. For those new to the ritual, it requires:\n\n\n   1) overripe vegetable matter;\n\n\n   2) an arm better than the pitcher who will replace Johnson;\n\n\n   3) grocery-sack headgear;\n\n\n   4) new-found passion for Seahawk exhibition games.\n\n\n   Not since Tim Floyd showed up to coach the Chicago Bulls has\nthere been a sporting constituency left with such a flim-flammed\nfeeling.\n\n\n   A week full of rumors of veteran, immediate help fueled\nexpectations that the Mariners will come out of this self-made\nordeal almost whole, particularly since the Yankees were indeed\nready to deal Hideki Irabu.\n\n\n   But the Mariner price _ Irabu and third-base prospect Mike\nLowell _ proved too steep even for the loaded Yankees, because\nthere was no guarantee Johnson would sign with them after the\nseason. They bailed out early in the evening, as did apparently\nevery other team offering major leaguers.\n\n\n   So in the short term, the Mariners ended up with the worst of\nall possible arrangements _ no Johnson and no immediate help.\n\n\n   The desperation of July was a direct descendant of last winter's\ndecision to stand pat. The flawed decision was a surprising tactic,\ngiven that they had won just one playoff game in the previous two\nseasons.\n\n\n   The longer term is, of course, unknowable. Management is\ncounting on the good grace of its fan base to wait on 21-year-old\nFreddy Garcia and 22-year-old Carlos Guillen. But the credibility\nwas already strained in the first moments when the club's press\nrelease identified the players as ``Freddy Garcia and Carlos\nGarcia.''\n\n\n   Perhaps the player to be named is another Garcia _ Jerry. At\nleast he used to play a little third bass.\n\n\n   The good grace of its fan base was already stretched thin,\nbecause knowledgable fans understand that Garcia and Guillen are\nreplacing prospects from earlier seasons squandered on trades for\nveterans in failed attempts to reach the World Series.\n\n\n   Mariner manager Lou Piniella admitted as much.\n\n\n   ``I'm sure we tried to get players who fit here immediately,''\nhe said. ``Obviously it didn't work out. We gave up young prospects\nto enhance our situation before. Houston is doing the same",

      "content": "His recipe, with a sauce of orange juice, sherry and soy sauce,\nwas a little more complex than what I was looking for. I just\nstuffed the duck with root vegetables _ carrots, turnips, garlic,\nshallots, beets _ and placed it in a roasting pan, surrounded by\nmore vegetables. Those inside helped keep the breast moist; those\noutside roasted slowly in the fat.\n\n\n   After covering the duck with foil, I began roasting it in a very\nhot oven _ 500 degrees _ for 10 minutes, and then dropped the heat\nto a temperature even lower than what I use to toast nuts, to 300\ndegrees. Then I roasted it for four and a half hours, the last hour\nwithout the foil, to crisp the skin.\n\n\n   What came out of the oven was a revelation. The duck had nearly\ncollapsed under its own weight. Its skin had given up most of its\nfat and had reduced to a thin, chewy layer, the color of caramel.\nThe meat, moist and slippery like buttery rillettes, fell from the\nbone. The vegetables had cooked tender in the duck fat, shrinking a\nlittle. I had hardly done a thing, and my oven did not look as if a\nfat bomb had exploded in it.\n\n\n   But divine as it was, it had a rival.\n\n\n   I had called Nina Simonds, the author of several books on\nChinese cooking, including ``Asian Wraps'' (William Morrow, $23),\nto ask her how to make Peking duck, prepared with the skin\nseparated from the flesh and the entire duck coated in maltose\nsyrup and then hung to roast. It's difficult to do at home, she\ntold me, and instead she suggested a Sichuan dish called ``crispy\nskin duck.'' The name was all I needed to hear.\n\n\n   The duck is marinated in rice wine, scallions, ginger, star\nanise and Sichuan peppercorns. Then it is steamed whole in a\ncovered wok for nearly two hours. As it steams, its fat melts,\nfalling into the water, and the meat relaxes until it weeps.\n\n\n   At this point, the challenge is to refrain from eating it as is\n(it could, in fact, be served like this without the skin). Steaming\nforces the aroma of scallions, ginger and peppercorns to permeate\nthe bird like a vanilla bean infusing warm cream.\n\n\n   I forged on. Ms. Simonds' recipe next instructs you to coat the\nentire duck in soy sauce and cornstarch, and then to fry it whole\nin peanut oil. ``Traditionally, it's deep-fried twice, and it gets\nso crisp,'' she said. ``But who wants to bother with that?''\n\n\n   Who wants to bother with that once? This seemed not only\ndubious, but also frighteningly messy. I did just half the bird.\n\n\n   It was delicious, indeed, and incredibly crunchy. But the mess\nwas as awful as I had imagined. My sofa across the room still\nsmells of duck a week and a half later.\n\n\n   For the remaining half, I went back to the Union Square Cafe\nmethod of pan-roasting it at the last minute. As the pieces touched\ndown on the pan, they sizzled and immediately began crisping and\nbrowning. And by the time they emerged from the oven, they looked\nas if they'd been lacquered.\n\n\n   The duck was perfect: the skin was crisp and deliciously salty,\nthe meat was moist, and its rich flavor had melded completely with\nthe scallion, ginger and peppercorns.\n\n\n   And I was speechless.

      "content": "AN ARGENTINE PASSOVER, THEN AND NOW \n\n\n\n   Passover comes in the fall in the Southern Hemisphere, but even\nfor a gaucho judio in the pampas, the eight-day holiday means what\nit does for most Jews in the United States: gefilte fish with\nhorseradish, chicken soup with matzoh balls and roast chicken.\n\n\n   But there, cooks are much more involved in the preparations.\nOnly recently have they had access to store-bought Passover\nstaples.\n\n\n   Buenos Aires is home to the largest concentration of Jews in\nLatin America, and Argentina has the seventh-largest Jewish\npopulation by country in the world: 206,000. Most came fleeing the\npogroms of Russia, although about 15 percent are Sephardic, from\nSyria, Turkey and North Africa.\n\n\n   Unlike Eastern European immigrants to the United States,\nhowever, many of the earliest settlers were farmers. Diego Guelar,\nthe Argentine ambassador to the United States, said his\ngreat-grandfather arrived from Lithuania in 1891 with the Jewish\nColonization Association of Paris, a fund established by the\nphilanthropist Baron Maurice de Hirsch to create Jewish\nagricultural colonies in Argentina.\n\n\n   Like a few of these Jewish cowboys, the Guelars stayed on the\nland, eventually swapping farming for cattle breeding.\n\n\n   From his home in Washington, Guelar recalled that at his\nchildhood Passovers on a ranch in Entre Rios Province, about 400\nmiles northeast of Buenos Aires, roast chicken was on the menu,\nalong with Eastern European recipes like potatoes stuffed with\nground beef and onions.\n\n\n   These are called chremslach in Eastern Europe and albondigas de\npapas in Argentina. An avocado and lettuce salad replaces the\nasparagus served in the United States.\n\n\n   Until recently, most Passover dishes in Argentina were made from\nscratch. Very few of the kinds of products now taken for granted in\nthis country were sold in stores. Guelar, who is 48, recalls how on\nhis ranch the gefilte fish was made by hand-grinding carp,\nwhitefish and pike, and then stuffing it into the skin of a large\ncarp.\n\n\n   Today, with more kosher-for-Passover products available, like\nvinegar and oil, Argentines can eat their roast chicken marinated\nin chimichurri sauce, a garlicky blend of vinegar and spices. The\nrecipe here is from Naomi Sisson, the wife of the Israeli Consul\nGeneral in New York, who grew up in Rosario, in the province just\nnortheast of Entre Rios.\n\n\n   Argentina is one of the few countries where kosher butchers\nprovide the beef casings to make kishke, the Jewish holiday dish of\nintestines stuffed with potatoes, matzoh meal, eggs, chicken fat\nand spices.\n\n\n   ``Once, there were 50 kosher butchers in Buenos Aires,'' Adolfo\nMaleh told me during a recent visit to Argentina. Now, he is one of\nthe 20 or so remaining in the entire country. Maleh, who is\nSephardic, makes beef chorizo at his Carniceria Simon in Once\n(pronounced OWN-say), traditionally the city's Jewish neighborhood.\n\n\n   The stores in Once and other neighborhoods now offer packaged\nproducts for Passover from Israel and the United States, like cake\nmixes and tomato paste and soups, as well as the local Yanovsky\nbrand of matzoh and matzoh meal.\n\n\n   Many in the younger generation use these time-saving products,\nbut the old-timers do not. Susana Shalalof, who has cooked for 35\nyears at Succath David, one of the few kosher restaurants in Buenos\nAires, makes traditional Syrian dishes at home for Passover (the\nrestaurant closes for the holiday).\n\n\n   Her stuffed vegetables, from a recipe brought by her parents\nfrom Syria, are filled with beef or lamb, rice and pine nuts,\nseasoned with cumin, allspice and cinnamon and served in a sauce of\ntomato, tamarind and cinnamon, all ingredients permissible at\nPassover for Syrian Jews.\n\n\n   Unlike cooks in this country, Mrs. Shalalof, like most\nArgentines, doubles the amount of beef in her traditional recipes\nfor Passover, and throughout the year.\n\n\n   ARGENTINE ROAST CHICKEN WITH VEGETABLES AND CHIMICHURRI SAUCE &QL;\n\n\n   Adapted from Naomi Sisson &QL;\n\n\n   Time: 50 minutes, plus overnight marination\n\n\n   \\ cup kosher-for-Passo",

      "content": "LAMB NECK IS NOT JUST FOR THE KITCHEN STAFF ANYMORE \n\n\n\n   NEW YORK _ When I was a young cook in France, it was common for\nthe butcher to give the kitchen staff the lamb neck. He would take\nthe cut, considered too humble to serve to the restaurant's guests,\nand slice it so that each piece had some of the firm, chewy meat\nand the flavor-giving bones. We would roast the lamb with garlic,\ndried fennel, and herbs, and, to a cook, the crew would love it.\n\n\n   These days, when lusty flavor is so much in demand, the neck of\nthe lamb is as welcome in the dining room as it was in the kitchen.\n\n\n   At my restaurant, I serve the neck as part of ``an epigram of\nlamb,'' a dish that uses many parts: the neck and shoulder are\nboned, stuffed, and braised; the rack and saddle are marinated and\nroasted; and the leg is studded with garlic and herbs, and given a\nlong, juicy roast. This time, I decided to create a special dish\nfor this underappreciated cut.\n\n\n   In the best of all possible worlds, you would have your butcher\nreserve a whole neck, which is about a foot long and looks a little\nlike an oxtail. He would bone and butterfly it so that you could\nstuff it with savory ground pork, roll and tie it, and then braise\nit.\n\n\n   But necks can be hard to come by.

      "content": "POT ROAST GOES ASIAN \n\n\n\n   Pot roast with Asian flavors is becoming more common, but the\nrecipe usually calls for a full shelf of ingredients and a day or\ntwo of marination, both of which defeat the purpose of this\nsuper-simple main course.\n\n\n   Pot roast should be the epitome of a minimalist meal. Since the\nmeat has to be braised until almost falling apart, timing is\nflexible. Since it is cooked in a covered pot with liquid, it never\ndries out, whether you cook it on top of the stove or in the oven,\nat low or high heat. You can serve pot roast as soon as it is\nfinished or cook it in advance and reheat it. In any case, the\ncooking turns a tough cut of beef tender for a one-pot supper.\n\n\n   The usual pot roast has roots in France or Britain and so is\ncooked with onions, garlic, mushrooms and red wine or stock. There\nis no tradition of Asian pot roasts, since a scarcity of fuel in\neast Asia precluded long, slow cooking. But if you substitute soy\nsauce and water for red wine or stock, and ginger and star anise\nfor onions and mushrooms, the meat takes on Asian flavors.\n\n\n   And pot roast really is pretty effortless, especially if you\nskip browning the meat. Browning does create complexity, but there\nis so much flavor in this Asian dish that it is not so important.\nOnce everything is in the pot, your only job will be to turn the\nmeat occasionally, if you like, and to make sure the liquid in the\npot does not evaporate. Keep the heat fairly low, so that the\nliquid does not boil away quickly.\n\n\n   The one tricky part of pot roast is choosing the beef. Tender\ncuts, like sirloin and tenderloin, will cook much quicker but will\nnot develop the same rich, silky sauce as the tougher cuts do. It\nis the tough connective tissue, combined with the seasoned braising\nliquid, that makes the sauce great. Inexpensive cuts like chuck or\nbrisket are best. Chuck turns tender a little faster, but it is\nfattier and you will never be able to cut nice, even slices from\nthe roast. Brisket becomes a little drier, but the sauce takes care\nof that, and it slices beautifully.\n\n\n   Many new recipes for Asian-flavored pot roast advise seasoning\nor marinating the meat overnight, but because the star anise,\nginger and soy sauce are so strong you can easily dispense with\nthat step.\n\n\n   The vegetables added to the pot at the start of cooking, whether\nginger or garlic, contribute to the sauce's development, but those\nat the end, like the rutabagas and turnips, draw on the sauce for\nflavor, often making them the best part.\n\n\n   &UR; ASIAN POT ROAST &LR;\n\n\n   &UR; Time: 3 to 4 hours &LR;\n\n\n   1 tablespoon peanut or vegetable oil\n\n\n   1 3- to 4-pound piece of brisket or boneless chuck\n\n\n   one-third cup dark soy sauce (or { cup light soy sauce)\n\n\n   5 nickel-size slices ginger (peeling is not necessary)\n\n\n   4 star anise\n\n\n   2 to 3 cups peeled and cubed rutabaga or white turnip\n\n\n   { cup trimmed and minced scallions.\n\n\n   1. Place oil in a large skillet, and turn heat to high. A minute\nlater, add meat, cover the pan loosely to reduce spattering and\nsear about five minutes on each side, or until nicely browned.\nMeanwhile, combine soy, ginger, star anise and 2 cups of water in a\ncasserole big enough to fit the meat snugly. Bring to a boil, then\nlower to a simmer.\n\n\n   2. When the meat is browned, add it to casserole and cover.\nCook, turning meat once or twice an hour and adding more water if\nnecessary, for about 3 hours, or until meat is just about tender _\nor until a thin-bladed knife inserted into the meat meets little\nresistance. Fish out star anise, and add rutabaga or turnip,\nstirring to make sure it is coated with liquid (again, add more\nwater if necessary). Re-cover, and cook until rutabaga is very\ntender, 30 minutes.\n\n\n   3. Remove meat, and slice very thin. Either return it to the pot\nor place it on a platter with the sauce and rutabaga. Garnish with\nscallions and serve, preferably with white rice.\n\n\n   Yield: 6 to 8 servings.\n\n\n   Variation: For a European pot roast with carrots, substitute\nolive oil for peanut oil, carrots for rutabagas and chopped",

      "content": "&HT;   \n\n\n\n   DAYTON, Ohio _ It is still winter, the tag end of February, and\nat lunch nothing sounds better than a big mug of soup.\n\n\n   But if you didn't make it yourself and tote it to the office, a\ngood bowl of soup can be hard to find. Many restaurants rely on\ncommercial soup bases, and even homestyle mom-and-pop restaurants\ndump bags of frozen vegetables in the pot. And once made, the soup\ncan sit in heated pots, thickening to a sludge as the hours drag\nby.\n\n\n   None of this is the makings of good soup.\n\n\n   But at Chin's Oriental Restaurant indowntown Dayton, owner Art\nChin is a believer in scratch soups. He makes his own stock,\nstarting with the bones left from deboning chicken for entrees.\n\n\n   At DiSalvo's Deli and Italian store in Kettering, Rinaldo\nDiSalvo starts making tomorrow's soup today. It is a six-hour\nprocess that begins with bones _ maybe pork bones from the meat\nhe's boned to make his sausage or maybe chicken or beef bones.\n\n\n   And at Flavors in Englewood, Elaine Alex-Lorusso and her\nhusband, Rich, make a different soup every day, choosing from a\nrepertoire of 45. The variety ranges from a portobello with red\nonion in a clear broth, which she describes as ``way beyond\npopular,'' to a thick black bean soup with sliced turkey.\n\n\n   ``In the morning we come in and prep for another soup,'' she\nsays. They, too, make their own stock, a necessity because many of\ntheir customers are vegetarian.\n\n\n   While Chin's featured soup changes with the season, ``salmon\nsoup is the signature for our fusion cooking,'' says Chin, and it\nis brought back annually in fall and winter.\n\n\n   Other rotating soups that Chin calls light entrees are a ramen\nnoodle soup with strip steak and a soba noodle soup made with\nJapanese dashi and sliced marinated chicken and vegetables, plus a\nduck soup. For that one, Chin browns the bones, carrots, onion and\njalapeno peppers to make the stock. The duck meat is marinated,\nseared and slivered and added to the soup with shredded vegetables.\n\n\n   Chin always has three traditional soups on the line: hot and\nsour, wonton and egg drop, but makes some soups to order. Those\nquick soups include the house-made broth, with additions of either\ncooked rice or noodles, and some chicken and steamed vegetables to\ngo on top.\n\n\n   One of the best may be a soup of fresh tofu and Asian greens\ndropped into the boiling stock, and Chin says they willingly make a\nvegetarian version starting with water, a little soy, some ginger,\nplus a touch of garlic, salt and pepper.\n\n\n   ``It makes a pretty good vegetarian broth,'' he says.\n\n\n   At DiSalvo's, the soup of the day depends on the owner's whim.\n\n\n   ``I gotta do something different. I can't do the same thing all\nthe time,'' he says. He's working on an asparagus soup to introduce\nin the spring.\n\n\n   Usually DiSalvo roasts meaty bones before adding them to a\nstockpot of water. But he changes his methods to suit his whims, so\nfor his lentil soup last week he skipped the browning process and\njust added the unroasted bones to the water along with some leeks.\nThat was at 8 a.m., and he didn't turn off the burner until 2 p.m.\nBy then the lentils had thickened to a puree. The soup needed only\nto be cooled and refrigerated for the next day.\n\n\n   DiSalvo's soups never go back into a soup pot or steam table.\n\n\n   ``I can't stand soup on a steam table all day. It ruins the\nsoup,'' he says. So he heats each bowl of soup to order. ``People\nhave to wait for soup here, but it's fresh.''\n\n\n   The lineup, with no scheduled rotation, includes an Italian\nwedding soup, full of chunks of chicken as well as Romano-flavored\nchicken meatballs and pastina. While that's the deli's\nmost-requested soup, DiSalvo prefers making bean soup _ escarole\nand white beans, black bean soup, split pea soup, pasta fagioli and\nminestrone.\n\n\n   As at Flavors, customers just have to call to find out what's\nfresh.\n\n\n   Here are scratch soup recipes from the three businesses.\n\n\n   CHIN'S FRESH SALMON SOUP\n\n\n   Makes 4 large servings\n\n\n   8 to 10 ounces fresh salmon, cubed\n\n\n   6 cups unseasoned vegetable o",

Anchor the veggies in florist clay in a\ncontainer, or make a bridesmaid-style bouquet of baby artichokes,\nasparagus, yellow wax beans, radishes, sprouts, parsley and\nanything else that strikes your fancy from the produce counters.\nFill in with Queen Anne's Lace. For backing, use a frill of lace or\na doily.\n\n\n   Think about vegetables for cooking, too. The favorite hallmarks\nof spring _ artichokes and asparagus _ are joined this year by\nseveral new arrivals, including broccolini, broccoli sprouts and\ngreen gourmet garlic. These new vegetables will inspire culinary\nadventures.\n\n\n   Many of the newcomers have a high nutrition profile and make it\neasy to get the five servings a day that nutrition experts would\nhave us eat to reduce the risk of cancer and heart disease and\npromote optimum health.\n\n\n   Broccolini\n\n\n   Broccolini is a cross between broccoli and Chinese kale. Despite\nits Italian-sounding name, it was developed in Japan. It is green\nwith long, slender stalks like kale; the small head of buds at the\ntop is smaller than broccoli. It was created by Sakata Seed Co. in\nYokohama, Japan, which christened it Asparation for its\nasparagus-like stalks.\n\n\n   Sakata was trying to expand its market for broccoli seed because\nbroccoli requires a cool growing atmosphere. That limits it to\ncertain times of year and certain locations. It took seven years to\ndevelop the hybrid, which is smaller and more tender than broccoli,\nespecially the stalk. Tasters found broccolini more elegant than\nbroccoli. They liked its size and appearance and the fact that the\nwhole plant is edible.\n\n\n   A California company, Sanbon, also calls broccolini Asparation.\nIt is much more expensive than broccoli. It is sold at Kroger\nSignature stores for $1.69 a bunch (about 8 ounces).\n\n\n   Broccoli sprouts\n\n\n   Broccoli sprouts have 30 to 50 times the concentration of\nprotective chemicals compared to mature broccoli. A diet rich in\nbroccoli (and other cruciferous vegetables such as cabbage and\ncauliflower) is associated with a lower risk of cancer. To halve\nthe odds of colon cancer, you would have to eat about 2 pounds of\ncooked broccoli a week. With broccoli sprouts, 1 ounce a week\nprovides the same protection as 1 1/4 pounds of broccoli.\n\n\n   This may be good news to those who don't like broccoli, because\nthe sprouts, which are tender shoots about 2 inches tall, don't\ntaste like the stronger-flavored mature vegetable.\n\n\n   They also contain phytochemicals, a new buzz word in nutrition\ncircles. Scientists believe that phytochemicals may be one reason a\ndiet rich in fruits and vegetables can reduce the risk of disease.\n\n\n   Broccoli sprouts are grown from special seeds, adding only water\nand light. They contain antioxidants, which help destroy harmful\nfree radicals in the body. The sprouts were developed by scientists\nat Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and are marketed as\nFresh Alternatives BroccoSprouts. They were introduced at Kroger\nSignature stores in February.\n\n\n   Broccoli sprouts can be used like other sprouts in salads, on\nsandwiches or as garnishes.\n\n\n   Green gourmet garlic\n\n\n   A stalk of green gourmet garlic looks like a smaller version of\na green onion with a garlic bulb on the end instead of an onion.\n\n\n   Dilip Naik of Sugar Land, Texas, grew up in Surat in the state\nof Gujarat on the west coast of India, where green gourmet garlic\nis a staple in the cuisine. Naik missed it when he moved to Houston\nto work as an engineer.\n\n\n   He realized the climate here is similar to Surat's and began to\ngrow some of the baby garlic plants for his own use.

JOSEF HEBERT, Associated Press Writer\n\n\n   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An isolated speck in the center of the Pacific\nOcean, the Palmyra Atoll, a pristine network of 52 small islands is\nbeing purchased by a conservation group to guarantee the\npreservation of its pristine marine wilderness.\n\n\n   The Nature Conservancy will announce Thursday that it is buying\nthe uninhabited islands -- 680 acres of land in all -- and adjacent\ncoral reefs and lagoons, from the Fullard-Leo family in Hawaii.\n\n\n   The price was not disclosed, but is said to be in the range of\n$30 million.\n\n\n   Although privately owned, the atoll is considered a territory of\nthe United States and under the civil jurisdiction of the Interior\nDepartment. The Nature Conservancy hopes that two-thirds of the\natoll eventually will be administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife\nService as a wildlife refuge.\n\n\n   Calling it a ''jewel of America's Pacific coral reefs,''\nInterior Secretary Bruce Babbitt said the atoll -- just north of the\nequator and 1,052 miles south of Honolulu -- ''should be protected\nfrom exploitation'' and preserved for future generations to see.\n\n\n   The island's colorful history dates back more than two centuries\nand includes everything from buried pirates' treasure and talk of\nan island curse to a battle before the U.S. Supreme Court over\nownership. It played a key part in a murder mystery that eventually\nproduced a best seller and a made-for-television movie. And while\nnow seen as an ideal place for ecological research, in the 1970s it\nalmost became a placed to dump nuclear waste.\n\n\n   Folklore has it that in 1816 a Spanish pirate ship, full of Inca\ntreasures, wrecked on the Palmyra reefs and its crew supposedly\nburied the loot under a palm tree. But treasure hunting is only one\nof the potential threats to the island's plush, tropical foliage,\npristine coral treasures and crystal clear lagoons.\n\n\n   ''There have been a range of threats over time'' prompting the\nNature Conservancy's interest in buying the atoll, says Nancy\nMackinnon, who has been working on the Palmyra project for the\nconservation group since 1997.\n\n\n   In the 1970s, the Energy Department saw Palmyra as a place to\ndump nuclear waste, only to abandon the idea. Private entrepreneurs\nmore recently wanted it for chemical and nuclear waste storage.\nOther buyers have had plans to build a hotel and casino and even a\nretreat for senior citizens.\n\n\n   During World War II, Palmyra was a U.S. Navy waypoint for\nairplanes crossing the Pacific. A 6,000-foot runway and other\nbuildings were built, but they are now dilapidated and overgrown by\njungle. No one lives on the islands today.\n\n\n   Mackinnon says the island's rich ecological treasures will\nprovide a paradise for research and ecotourism. ''But only in small\ngroups,'' she adds quickly.\n\n\n   The islands, which receive 175 inches of rain a year, are\ncovered by lush tropical vegetation that provides a place for an\nestimated million nesting seabirds. Countless birds rely on the\nislands as a resting place as they migrate -- some from as far away\nas Alaska to the South Pacific.\n\n\n   The atoll's reefs have three to five times the number of coral\nspecies found in Hawaii or the Florida Keys. Black-tip and tiger\nsharks abound in its waters and other marine species include pilot\nwhales, bottlenosed dolphins, hawksbill turtles, giant clams and\nthe coconut crab, the world's largest land-based invertebrate that\ncracks open coconuts with its claws.\n\n\n   Some old salts have suggested the atoll is cursed because of\ntales of mariners who have landed there and later fell upon\nmisfortune.\n\n\n   In 1974, a San Diego, Calif., couple were murdered aboard their\nexpensive yacht by another couple they had befriended, and their\nbodies were dumped in waters near Palmyra. The woman's skeletal\nremains were found six year later after they had washed ashore. The\ndouble murder later became a best selling book, ''And The Sea Will\nTell'', and a made-for-television movie.\n\n\n AP-NY-05-03-00 1802",

      "content": "HURRICANE POINTS TO LOSING BATTLE AGAINST BEACH EROSION \n\n\n\n   NORTH TOPSAIL BEACH, N.C. _ In the aftermath of Hurricane\nBonnie, officials looking across the flat stretches of beach that\nonce held sand dunes can see that they may be fighting a losing\nbattle against erosion.\n\n\n   The hurricane, which pummeled the North Carolina coastline last\nweek, took with it about 60 percent of the dune line along North\nTopsail Beach, the northernmost stretch of Topsail Island north of\nWilmington. Erosion has chipped away at the 25-mile-long barrier\nisland, and in a few places, its width has been whittled to about\n150 yards.\n\n\n   The disappearance of parts of the dune line after large storms\nis not surprising, said Orrin Pilkey, a geologist at Duke\nUniversity in Durham.\n\n\n   ``This is the most dangerous island community in North Carolina\nand one of the most dangerous along the East Coast,'' Pilkey said.\n``The dunes are all artificial and extremely fragile, and, all in\nall, it's an island community that should not have been developed\nif common sense were to prevail.''\n\n\n   The island, once undeveloped and a haven for surf fishermen, has\ngrown rapidly in the last few years as developers have built\ncondominiums and resorts. Even Hurricanes Fran and Bertha two years\nago, which knocked down first and second rows of houses in places\non the beach, did not deter development.\n\n\n   Although it has taken time for homeowners to rebuild and for\nbusinesses to recoup losses, new houses replacing those damaged by\nthe storms are scattered on the island. The hurricanes also took\nmuch of what remained of the island's maritime forests, which help\nslow erosion.\n\n\n   ``I've not seen a hurricane have a big impact on development\njust other than to bring in bigger and better buildings,'' Pilkey\nsaid. ``That's really fundamentally the impact these things have.\nIt's really an urban renewal project.''\n\n\n   But hurricanes, development and the natural give and take of the\ntide have taken their toll on the dunes. While the southern end has\nmaintained a larger natural berm, other parts of the island's dune\nsystem have had to be rebuilt. Sand from the island has repeatedly\nbeen bulldozed into 10-foot high piles, which offer some protection\nfrom the tides, but are not as stable as natural dunes and have to\nbe replaced after storms.\n\n\n   ``I'd be willing to bet they lost 120 feet in the last 20\nyears,'' said Bill Cleary, a professor of geology at the Center for\nMarine Science Research at the University of North Carolina at\nWilmington.\n\n\n   Tony Hammond, the town manager of North Topsail Beach, said the\ncost of replacing the dunes was justified if it saved houses.\n\n\n   ``The dunes that had the vegetation seem to have held up\nbetter,'' Hammond said. ``The ones with the limited vegetation\ndidn't do as well.''\n\n\n   Pilkey said Topsail Island was never intended to accommodate\ndevelopment.\n\n\n   The constant chipping away of sand is proof that the island is\ndoing what nature intends, he said. The island has a small natural\nsand supply and is at a stage where it is beginning what he calls\ntrue migration. Barrier islands such as Topsail become thin from\nerosion and begin over washing, which moves sand into the sounds\nthat separate them from the mainland. The over washing widens the\nside closest to the mainland while the opposite side erodes.\n\n\n   ``That translates into island moving,'' Pilkey said. ``This is\nan island that wants to migrate.''\n\n\n   But homeowners do not like island migration. For several years,\nthe town has used bulldozers to pile up the sand, creating an\nartificial dune system.\n\n\n   After Hurricane Fran, the Federal Emergency Management Agency\nreimbursed North Topsail Beach $1.6 million of the $2 million cost\nof creating an emergency berm, by bulldozing sand displaced by\nstorms, said Jay Eaker, an agency spokesman.\n\n\n   Although these efforts will cause the island to migrate more\nslowly than it would naturally, Pilkey said, the process is\ninevitable. If hurricane activity increases as predicted _ and\nbrings them to the North Carolina coastline with the regula",

JOSEF HEBERT, Associated Press Writer\n\n\n   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Fish and other marine life are being killed\nand marshlands damaged in more than a third of the nation's coastal\nareas from algae blooms caused by the runoff of excess nutrients,\nthe National Academy of Sciences said Tuesday.\n\n\n   The scientists concluded that the problem of coastal pollution\nfrom nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers is so severe and\nwidespread that states require federal help. The nutrients often\ntravel hundreds of miles along rivers before they create problems.\n\n\n   ''Conditions in many coastal areas are expected to worsen unless\naction is taken now to reduce nutrient pollution,'' said Robert\nHowarth, a professor of ecology and environmental biology at\nCornell University, and the panel's chairman.\n\n\n   While nitrogen and phosphorous occur in nature and are critical\nto support plant life in marine environments, too much of the\nnutrients causes an excessive growth of phytoplankton and other\norganisms, which deprive fish and other marine life, including\nplants, of oxygen. That causes marine life to die or be driven\naway.\n\n\n   Algae blooms caused by an overabundance of nutrients --\nspecifically, excessive nitrogen from agricultural fertilizers or\npoultry waste -- have been linked to a decline of fisheries, the\ndeath of manatees along the Florida coast, and the loss of coral\nreefs and sea grasses, the panel said.\n\n\n   Algae blooms have been blamed for years for the so-called dead\nzone in the Gulf of Mexico along the Louisiana and Texas coast.\nLarge amounts of nutrients flowing from the Farm Belt into and down\nthe Mississippi River have caused the massive dead zone -- the size\nof New Jersey -- each spring in the Gulf of Mexico. Scientists\nestimated the amount of nitrogen pouring from the river into the\nGulf has tripled, and the amount of phosphorous doubled, in the\npast 40 years.\n\n\n   Algae blooms also have been linked to a microbial called\npfiesteria that has killed fish in tributaries of the Chesapeake\nBay and off the Carolinas.\n\n\n   But the report by the Academy's National Research Council said\nthat nitrogen and phosphorous pollution is causing environmental\ndamage along almost all of the nation's estuaries, with severe\nproblems identified in 44 of the 139 coastal areas examined.\n\n\n   ''Excess nitrogen in our coastal waters starts a dangerous chain\nof ecological events that is exacerbating harmful algae blooms such\nas red tides, contaminating shellfish, killing coastal wildlife,\nreducing biodiversity, destroying sea grass, and contributing to a\nhost of other environmental problems,'' warned Howarth.\n\n\n   Because rivers often transport chemical nutrients hundreds of\nmiles from inland farmland and urban centers, the most severe\nproblem areas, according to the report, are where rivers and bays\nfeed water into the ocean.\n\n\n   Severe problem areas, where there were symptoms of low oxygen\nlevels, toxic algae blooms and loss of submerged aquatic\nvegetation, were found along the coasts of nine states: Washington,\nCalifornia, Louisiana, Texas, Florida, North Carolina, Maryland,\nNew York, and Massachusetts.\n\n\n   The most severe problems were reported in the mid-Atlantic\nstates and the Gulf of Mexico, the report said.\n\n\n   Worldwide, human activity -- from excessive use of fertilizers to\nthe burning of fossil fuels -- have caused the amount of nitrogen in\nthe environment to more than double since the 1960s. The wide use\nof synthetic fertilizers account for much of the growth, but other\nsources are animal waste, including chicken and hog manure,\ndischarges from wastewater treatment plants, and the burning of\nfossil fuels.\n\n\n   Nitrogen compounds in the air, usually from smokestacks, also\ncontribute to the high nutrient levels in some estuaries,\nespecially along the East Coast, the panel said. It estimated that\ntougher pollution controls on soot being imposed by the\nEnvironmental Protection Agency could cut such water deposits by as\nmuch as 17 percent.\n\n\n   There are no federal l",

I obey the rules and catch enough to feed my family and\nfriends. I'm not political, but if anybody gets in the way of my\nfishing, they're going to hear from me.''\n\n\n   Papoulidis is one of 5 million recreational and 16,000\ncommercial fishermen in Florida, all demanding a fair share of the\nocean's resources. To guarantee a future for fisheries however,\nmany scientists say as much as 40 percent of the world's marine\necosystems need protection. That means closing or restricting many\ntraditional fishing areas and creating what are becoming known\nglobally as Marine Protected Areas.\n\n\n   The National Research Council, an independent arm of the\nNational Academy of Science, is in the middle of a\ngovernment-financed, two-year study of the protected areas. The\ncouncil's committee of 21 international experts is conducting a\nseries of five public forums around the United States coastlines.\n\n\n   In April, members met in Islamorada, Fla., to gather information\nfor their report on the feasibility of protected areas in the\nUnited States. The meeting, held 30 miles northeast of Marathon,\nsurrounded by the 3,674-square-mile Florida Keys National Marine\nSanctuary, featured fishermen and scientists in the vanguard of\ndesigning marine reserves, a more restrictive step beyond existing\nmarine sanctuaries in protecting ocean habitat and resources.\n\n\n   ``Everything else has failed,'' the chairman, Eduarde Houde,\nsaid of past policies that have focused on species-specific\nmanagement. ``Marine Protected Areas are the last resort for\nfisheries management.''\n\n\n   The committee is reviewing data collected from sanctuaries and\nareas currently closed by regulation. According to scientists at\nIslamorada, protected areas represent a new paradigm in fisheries\nmanagement: one that works. A national fisheries service scientist,\nJim Bohnsack, pointed out the results of closing almost a third of\nGeorges Bank off the Maine coast in 1994, creating a de facto\nprotected areas. ``Only four years later,'' he said, ``haddock had\nincreased to the point that the trip limit was raised from 500\npounds per day to 2,000 pounds per day.''\n\n\n   Some scientists and environmental organizations favor moving\nahead with large closings immediately. But Graeme Kelleher, a\ncommittee member and a former vice chairman of the World\nConservation Union's commission on protected areas, reminded\nparticipants, ``The success of MPAs depends on cooperation and\nsupport from the fishing community.'' Kelleher's experience in the\nSouth Pacific has shown ``that if we close half the reef, we get\ntwice the fish. After a while fishermen start becoming advocates,\nbut they have to be involved in the process from the very start.''\n\n\n   The advent of ecosystem management has brought more voices to\nthe table. Scientists, ecotourists, and the public at large are\nclaiming a stake in an area that was once the sole domain of\nfishermen. In Florida, a region leading the way in protected areas,\nfishermen, regulators, the tourism industry and conservationists\nhave forged a fragile compromise on a 185-square-mile ``no take''\nmarine reserve in the Gulf of Mexico near the Dry Tortugas. They\nhope it will protect spawning aggregations of important species of\nsnapper and grouper, and increase the overall fish population\nthroughout the Keys.\n\n\n   Elsewhere, fishermen have been less agreeable to closed areas.\nIn New England, inshore regulatory closings have led to angry\nmeetings between regulators and user groups left with no place to\nfish.\n\n\n   And even in Florida, commercial fishermen pressured Gov. Jeb\nBush to drop Felicia Coleman from the Gulf of Mexico Fisheries\nManagement Council because of her advocacy of a 500-square-mile\nclosed area off Tampa.\n\n\n   Florida's recreational anglers support conservation bu",
