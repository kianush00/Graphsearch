The project started in May 1990 and will be completed in\n1997 at a cost of 6.5 billion yuan (about 7.8 million US dollars).\n\n\n-- Optical fiber trunk lines. A total of 22 trans-provincial\noptical cables totaling 37,000 km have been built in China. During\nthe coming five years, construction of more optical fiber lines is\nexpected to result in a total length of 210,000 km of such lines.\n\n\n-- Three Gorges Dam Project. It is one of the country's major\nprojects that aims to harness and develop the Yangtze River,\nintegrating the functions of preventing floods, generating\nelectricity and boosting river shipping. The super dam will be\n1,983 m long and 185 m in crest elevation. Total holding capacity\nof the reservoir behind the dam will be 39.3 billion cubic meters\nof water. A maximum 100,000 cubic meters of water can be\ndischarged per second through the dam.

The project has\nbeen a dream long cherished by the Chinese nation almost for a\ncentury.\n\n\nIn the 1910s, Dr. Sun Yat-sen, forerunner of the Chinese\ndemocratic revolution, became the first to propose the\nconstruction of a gigantic water control project around the Three\nGorges in the middle reaches of the Yangtze, China's largest\nriver.\n\n\nA major flood occurred on the Yangtze once every decade during\nthe two millenia from the Han Dynasty (206 BC-AD 220) to the end\nof the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), and two catastrophic floods in the\nthirties of this century alone claimed 300,000 lives along the\nriver.\n\n\nUpon the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949,\nthe first generation of New China's leaders headed by Mao Zedong\nstarted to draw up a blueprint for the project.\n\n\nAfter four decades of investigations, planning and debate,\nthe Three Gorges Project was finally approved by the National\nPeople's Congress -- the Chinese parliament - in 1992.\n\n\nAs the world's top water control scheme, it is projected to\ncost some 25 billion US dollars. The investment is estimated to\naccount for less than one thousandth of the cumulative GDP during\nthe 17 years of construction, thanks to enhanced national strength\nin the wake of China's reform and opening-up policies adopted 18\nyears ago.\n\n\nA series of knotty problems are involved in the project: the\namount of work of the project is the largest in the world, the\ntechnologies to be used in the project are complex and the 1.2\nmillion people to be relocated in the project area are\nunprecedented.\n\n\nConstruction of the project has been focused on a market\nmechanism and international conventional practices. After five\nyears of its initiation, the first stage of the project is\ncompleted ahead of schedule, construction quality has complied\nwith the pre-designed standards, and the actual investment is four\nbillion yuan less than the initial projected budget.\n\n\nMoreover, a development-oriented resettlement program has\nhelped the displaced farmers to become the first to be better-off\nin the Three Gorges area. By now more than 60,000 farmers have\nbeen resettled.\n\n\nThe Three Gorges Fund, a major source for the massive\ninvestment in the project, is based on an appropriate price\nincrease in power charges across the country. From 1993-1997, the\nfund collected a total of 13.7 billion yuan, equivalent to an\naverage of 11 yuan contributed by every Chinese.\n\n\nThe dream of the Three Gorges Project represent the Chinese\npeople's aspiration for building a stronger China.\n\n\nUpon its completion in 12 years, the project will bring huge\nbenefit to the nation by putting an end to floods in the middle\nand lower reaches of the Yangtze, relieving 15 million people of\nthe scourge of flood, and providing an average of additional 70 kw\nof electricity for each Chinese every year.",

In 1995, China put 6.5\nbillion yuan into the project, which only accounted for 0.11\npercent of the country's Gross National Product (GNP), Li\nexplained.\n\n\nBy the end of this February, China had poured 13 billion yuan\ninto the project, but the country has actually raised 14.2 billion\nyuan for it.\n\n\nMoney supply exceeding money demand has been rare in the\ncountry's history of capital construction, he said.\n\n\nLi said the project's money supply mainly depends on the Three\nGorges Foundation and bank loans. The foundation's income comes\nfrom two sources: first, the government imposed tax payments for\nthe consumption of electricity; second, the government has placed\nthe Gezhouba Power Station, China's largest so far, under the\nYRTGPDC. Through these two measures, the country is able to raise\nabout 100 billion yuan, or half of the total investment.\n\n\nThe project has won full support from the country's financial\ncircles. The State Development Bank, one of China's three major\npolicy banks, has promised to extend three billion yuan loans to\nthe project each year from 1993 to 2003. Over the past two years,\nthe bank has been fully committed to its promise. Other policy or\ncommercial banks have also extended loans to the project.\n\n\nFoundation and bank loans will contribute more than 130 billion\nyuan to the project, or 65 percent of the total investment.",

Yuan\nGuolin, deputy general manager of the China Yangtze River Three\nGorges Project Development Corporation told Xinhua that the\nincrease in power output was brought about by the country's robust\ndemand and its effort to restructure its power projects.\n\n\nThe Three Gorges Project has an estimated cost of 200 billion\nyuan. Construction work began in 1993. It will have a designed\ninstalled generating capacity of 20.9 million kw and yearly output\nof more than 100 billion kwh of electricity upon its completion in\n2009.\n\n\nThe project, on the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, the\ncountry's longest, is under the second phase of construction,\nwhich began in 1998 and will end when the first group of\ngenerating units are operating in 2003. During this phase, 18\nmillion cu.m. of concrete will be poured. To ensure safety,\nquality control is being given unprecedented attention and\nspecialists are being employed to give advice.\n\n\nThe dam behind the project is expected to play a major role in\ncontrolling floods on the middle reaches of the Yangtze, in\naddition to providing power. Profits from the Gezhouba Power Plant,\nwhich is the currewnt largest hydro-electric power projoect on the\nYantze and is now operating, are one of the main sources of\nfinancing for the project.\n\n\nWhen the first four generating units are operating in 2003,\nprofits from the sale of electricity will be used to fund the\nproject's third phase, which will last for 6 years beginning from\n2004. When that project is completed in 2009, the developer, which\nis in charge of both the Three Gorges and Gezhouba, will send much\nof the electricity to central and eastern parts of China, and\nincome will be used to repay the loans.\n\n\nChina's power plants can not fully meet its power demands. At\npresent, the world's annual average power consumption per capita\nis well over 2,200 kwh, but China's annual consumption per capita\nis 780 kwh, or just a tenth of that in developed countries. In\nHubei Province the annual average consumption is around 700 kwh\nper person, or below the Chinese national average. Even when the\nproject is finished, Hubei's per capita annual consumption will be\njust 50 percent of that of the world average.",

With the cost of construction estimated at\n50.09 billion yuan (6.05 billion U.S. dollars), the dam will have\nmany functions including flood control, power generation and the\nfacilitation of shipping on the river.\n\n\nIn July, the dam saw 12.16 billion cubic meters of water\nflowing from the upper reaches, the largest amount in 121 years,\nwith an average flow rate of 45,400 cubic meters per second. Most\nof the floodwater also came from the upper reaches in August.\n\n\nThis makes prominent the project's intended role in storing\nwater, which can prevent and control the crest from the upper\nreaches from converging with those at the middle reaches, and\nthereby protect 15 million people and 1.53 million hectares of\narable land in the lower reaches, according to experts with the\nState Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters.\n\n\nThe massive reservoir will have a storage capacity of 22.15\nbillion cubic meters of water, four times that of the storage\ncapacity of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Area.\n\n\n\"The operation of the reservoir will make the water diversion\nproject in the Jingjiang section almost unnecessary,\" said one\nexpert.\n\n\nAt the Jingjiang section of the Yangtze River, floods should\nbe diverted when the water flow rates reach 60,000 cubic meters\nper second. And the situation becomes precarious when the flow\nrate rises above 80,000 cubic meter per second.\n\n\nThe Three Gorges Dam Project, scheduled for completion in the\nyear 2009, has a designed capacity to handle water flows rates as\nhigh as 122,000 cubic meters per second, greatly enhancing its\nflood-fighting capability.\n\n\nThe dam will be able to reduce the water flow rate from 87,100\ncubic meter per second to 56,700 cubic meter per second, enabling\nthe water to go downstreams safely without the need for resorting\nto diversions, the experts said.",

Since the foundation of New China in 1949\nthe Chinese government has taken comprehensive exploitation and\ncontrol of major rivers and lakes, with emphasis on the prevention\nand control of flood and waterlogging, as an important task of\nwater conservancy construction. During the Eighth Five-Year Plan\nperiod, on the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, the\nlower reaches of the Yellow River, and on the Huaihe, Haihe,\nSonghua and Liaohe rivers and Lake Taihu, the main dikes were\nheightened and reinforced, waterways were cleaned up, and flood\ndiversion projects were built. The construction of a group of key\nprojects for water control and other uses were completed or\nstarted. To compensate for lack of water resources in northern\nareas, the Chinese government vigorously promoted the planning and\nconstruction of water-diversion projects between different\ndrainage basins. In November 1995 it sponsored an overall\nfeasibility study of the middle, eastern and western lines\nprojects for diverting water from south to north.\n\n\nThe Three Gorges Project is a gigantic, trans-century project\nfor harnessing and developing the Yangtze River.

The government has\norganized experts to work out the Report on the Impact of the\nThree Gorges Project on the Ecology and Environment, and\nCountermeasures, and has approved the Environmental Impact\nStatement of the Three Gorges Project.

Considering price rises, loan interest and other factors,\nthe investment may involve 240 billion yuan by the time the\nproject is completed in 2009, Yuan said.\n\n\nGenerally speaking, the investment scale is large, but since it\nis a long-term project, investment in the project annually is\ninsignificant in terms of the country's overall budget. In 1995\nChina put 6.5 billion yuan into the project, which only accounted\nfor 0.11 percent of the country's Gross National Product (GNP) and\n0.33 percent of the country's total investments in fixed assets.\n\n\nThe official acknowledged that by 2007 the project will see a\nfinancial gap of some 35 billion yuan, most of which would be in\nexistence before 2003. He said the gap would be filled mainly by\nraising money at home. The country also is considering utilizing\nforeign funds in the forms of export credits, commercial loans,\nand issuing stocks and bonds.\n\n\n\"There are many factors affecting the investment in the project\nduring the long period of construction. Besides, these factors are\nuncertain and complex,\" Yuan said.\n\n\n\"Therefore, control of investment has certain risks, and\ndiscrepancies may appear between the actual investment scale and\nprevious estimates,\" he added.\n\n\nTo deal with such problems, the company has taken a series of\nstern measures to control the investment in the project.\nInvestments have been put under multi-level control. A market\ncompetition system has also been introduced to reduce costs, the\nofficial said.\n\n\nControl of investment over the past few years has proved to be\neffective, Yuan said. The funding of the project is smooth at\npresent, and no shortage of money has so far affected the progress\nof the project, he added.\n\n\nThe Three Gorges Project is a comprehensive project for flood\ncontrol, power generation and navigation.\n\n\nWhen the Three Gorges Power Station starts to generate\nelectricity, the project will be able to repay the loans at the\nrate of 10 billion yuan a year, becoming a major source of debt\nrepayment.\n\n\nYuan said that his company will be able to repay all its debts\nbefore 2014.\n\n\nHe also said that debt structure of the project is relatively\nrational because state assets comprise 50 percent of the project's\ntotal assets, which will help reduce its debt burden.",

It also expects to amass another 11 billion\nyuan on the domestic market, which includes 6 billion yuan from\ncorporate bond issuance and 5 billion yuan from the stock market.\n\n\nIn January, the company issued 2 billion yuan worth of bonds,\nthe second issuance after the initial bond of one billion yuan in\n1996.\n\n\nMeanwhile, some 3 billion yuan in foreign currency will be\nraised from export earnings in buyers' credits and loans issued by\nforeign bank branches in China to pay capital and interest of\nforeign bank loans signed for the first construction period.\n\n\nThe world's largest water-control project has three solid\nfinancing sources, besides the government spending, which is\nbudgeted at 11.3 billion yuan this year. They consist of profits\nfrom the operational Gezhouba Power Plant and levies from\nincreased national hydroelectric prices as well as support from\nthe State Development Bank.\n\n\nCapital from the first two channels is expected to amount to\n110 billion yuan, accounting for over 50 percent of the total\ngovernment funding and has no interest charges. The state bank has\npromised 130 billion yuan of loans launched during the period of\n1994 to 2003, or 65 percent of the total cost for the project.\n\n\nOfficials from the company said that when it becomes partly\noperational in 2003, the Three Gorges Dam will be capable of\ngenerating more than 67 billion yuan of revenue within five years.\nIt means that before the end of 2005, its own income will be\nsufficient not only to meet the investment demand for the final-\nstage construction, but also to pay off some of its debt.\n\n\nEstimated to cost a total investment of 203.9 billion yuan, the\nproject on China's longest river the Yangtze, has secured capital\nof 39 billion yuan for the first six years of construction. When\nit is fully completed in 2010, it will have a total installed\ngenerating capacity of 20.9 million kilowatt and a projected\nyearly production of more than 100 billion kwh of electricity.",

For the dam is suffused in\ncontroversy as thick as the river mists that enfold construction\ncranes angling high over the Yangtze.\n\n\n   These workers and thousands more still to come will reconfigure\nnot just this site, but will flood the mystically beautiful Three\nGorges canyons that have inspired Chinese poets for centuries. And\nthey will trigger the eviction of more than one million Chinese who\nfish and farm and trade along the river that carries their\nlivelihood and sometimes their destruction.\n\n\n   ``China is still a poor country,'' Lu Youmei, general manager of\nthe China Three Gorges Project Corp., told Cox News Service\nrecently. ``To catch up to modern conditions in developed\ncountries, we may need half a century or even a century. The\nChinese have many things to do.''\n\n\n   Lu is convinced the state-constructed hydroelectric dam will\nboost China in its run toward modernity, producing electric power\nequivalent to the output of 18 nuclear plants, diminishing the\ndeadly threat of floods and making navigation more cheap, reliable\nand efficient.\n\n\n   The 26 generating units at this single site will have an\ninstalled\n\n\n   capacity of 18,200 megawatts, fully half the production\ncapability of the\n\n\n   entire, multi-state Southern Company, the largest producer of\nelectricity\n\n\n   in America.\n\n\n   A visit to this central Yangtze region shows that Western\nopponents who think they still can stop the Three Gorges Dam _\nwarning of environmental devastation and social dislocation _ had\nbetter think again.\n\n\n   Tens of thousands of Chinese peasants and villagers already have\nbeen relocated, as new towns rise on riverbank heights to replace\nthe low-lying buildings exploded into rubble.\n\n\n   Early stages of the dam itself are an imposing physical\npresence.\n\n\n   In five years, Lu's corporation has spent $3.7 billion,\nharnessed the Yangtze into a channel to drain a river bed building\nsite, planted one stout end of the dam and blasted a massive\nstair-stepped pit into the reddish-brown earth where shipping locks\nwill carry multi-ton vessels past the dam.\n\n\n   A new high-speed road and new airport funnel supplies and people\nhere, new apartment buildings shelter the workers, and a new\nChinese-British joint venture every year produces 6 million\nchickens, 60,000 pigs, and eggs from 200,000 hens to feed them.\n\n\n   The dam is all but a fact. Yet fateful uncertainties remain:\n\n\n   -- Will the dam actually end horrific Yangtze floods such as the\nthree major deluges that killed more than 300,000 people in this\ncentury?\n\n\n   -- Will a tangle of environmental complications result, such as\nchoking siltation that some predict will clog the very ports this\nproject is supposed to enhance? And will heavy upstream pollution\nconcentrate even further into a reservoir of bile as the dam\nreduces river flow?\n\n\n   -- Will the 1.1 million to 1.9 million people being resettled\nend up with better housing and work opportunities, as the\ngovernment promises? Or will Three Gorges follow the pattern of\nearlier Chinese dam projects, in which peasants were uprooted with\nmarginal help and resettlement funds got squandered?\n\n\n   -- Does the dam itself carry the threat of deluge, either as a\nwartime target or as result of earthquake or construction fault?\n\n\n   They add up to the overall question of whether the dam, power\nplant and resettlement, now carrying a $25 billion official price\ntag by completion of Phase 3 in 2009, will be worth the many\ndimensions of",
