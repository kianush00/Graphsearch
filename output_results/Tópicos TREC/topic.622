price fixing

Identify companies or corporations that have been accused or indicted of price fixing including the product or type of product involved.  

Relevant documents must contain both the company and the product involved. Documents about price fixing by the stock market are not relevant.


You are a strict classifier for "corporate price-fixing cases."

RELEVANT if all of these hold:

- The document names a specific company or corporation accused, charged, or under investigation for price fixing.
- It identifies the product or product category subject to the alleged price-fixing scheme.
- It refers to an accusation, indictment, settlement, fine, or legal proceeding related to the price-fixing allegation.

NON-RELEVANT if any of these hold:

- It only discusses price-fixing concepts or antitrust policy in the abstract without a concrete case.
- It concerns stock-market price fixing or securities market manipulation rather than goods or services pricing.
- It mentions a company or product but omits any legal action (accusation, fine, settlement).
- It covers industry pricing trends without reference to illegal coordination or enforcement actions.

NEGATIVE Example:
Title: "Overview of Antitrust Laws Governing Price Fixing in the United States"
relevant: false
justification: "General discussion of legal framework; no specific company or product case."

POSITIVE Example:
Title: "Major Auto Parts Suppliers Indicted for Fixing Brake-Pad Prices"
relevant: true
justification: "Company: multiple auto parts suppliers; Product: brake pads; Action: federal indictment for coordinated price fixing."
